We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.</td>\n",

I know it’s too large to be a carry on but I really don’t want to check it as I have multiple layovers and haven’t had the best experience with bags at airports in the past. \\nAre there any other options I have to make sure my pack doesn’t get lost or stolen?   \n",
       "3  A friend and I went backcountry camping in NM. We literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

From what I’ve read, there is not potable water where we will be. I have not done a hike where there weren’t water sources so looking for suggestions on what type of vessel to take (bladder, Smart Water bottles, Nalgene, etc) and also how much to take. I will have electrolyte mix to get some bang for my buck.   \n",

We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.</td>\n",

Because of air flights within the continent, we can only take a soft sided bag weighing no more than 33lbs. I have to double check if we’re allowed to take a separate backpack. Heading to a couple of safaris in Kenya and a gorilla trek in Uganda.\\n\\nTrying to manage the weight and stuff we only need while there, but also attire we should wear for the journey over there and back.\\n\\n- As far as electronics, plan on taking a DLSR camera and possibly an IPad. Maybe binoculars, if the weight allows. \\n- Does anyone have a sample picture of what kind of bag to take? A duffel bag?\\n- Also, when it comes to clothes, I was hoping to take advantage of laundry services so we don’t feel compelled to take too much. From what I can tell, laundry is doable, but they don’t do underwear so we’ll have to pack enough for a 12 day trip. \\n- What kind of shirts and pants should we buy? Where do we buy them? A place like REI? I was thinking throwing in a couple long sleeve dry fit Nike type shirts that could wash and dry easily. \\n- Also, when it comes to shoes, again any recommendations on type? Should we try to just take one type of shoe, or or take two different types depending on what we’re doing? \\n\\nThanks. Any insight is helpful. The 33lb weight limit makes it more interesting.</td>\n",

I love all things Asia and that is why I visit these streets every few days while I’m still here in Mexico City.\\n\\nIn terms of cultural domination, it is not as developed as China Town in New York City or Kampong Glam in Singapore (Muslim neighborhood with Malay and Arabic vibes). All street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly Asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game.\\n\\nHowever, you can see its authenticity by visiting any Asian grocery store. While most of the products are dried seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried noodles, and other products with long shelf life, you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge. I like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left Korea.\\n\\nBy the way, this kimchi is amazing, not like the supermarket stuff I tried before that.\\n\\nWikipedia says some of the residents of Little Seoul don’t even speak Spanish and live tightly within their own bubble. I can relate since I still don’t speak Spanish myself although I reside in Spanish-speaking countries for almost a year now.\\n\\nI love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk. It is interesting that Mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side, just like any modern nut milk — around 5% of fat content. But I’m used to the Asian coconut milk that is 18–20% of fat. My wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course.</td>\n",

I know it’s too large to be a carry on but I really don’t want to check it as I have multiple layovers and haven’t had the best experience with bags at airports in the past. \\nAre there any other options I have to make sure my pack doesn’t get lost or stolen?   \n",

We literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

From what I’ve read, there is not potable water where we will be. I have not done a hike where there weren’t water sources so looking for suggestions on what type of vessel to take (bladder, Smart Water bottles, Nalgene, etc) and also how much to take. I will have electrolyte mix to get some bang for my buck.   \n",

I learned that for some solo travelers and nomads sometimes it's challenging for them to meet new people every time they switch to a new city. That is why I created Nomad Friend Groups, free telegram groups that you can hop in and meet other travelers with over 200+ cities around the world!    \\n\\n\\nIntroducing: [nomadfriendgroups.com/groups](https://nomadfriendgroups.com/groups)    \\n\\n\\nGoing to Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sydney, NYC, Rio, Warsaw, Beijing, Mumbai, Anywhere?  We have you covered! Hop in and see our list of groups.    \\n\\n\\nI am also looking or admins to represent each city. Reach out to me personally on telegram if you are interested. I would love to have you on board to help grow these groups!   \n",

We stayed in an area that had small, identical cabins on the beach. Each cabin had a small living room/ kitchen, one bathroom and maybe two bedrooms. These cabins were all destroyed several years ago by a hurricane. \\n\\nI am looking for something similar for a possible future vacation. Does anyone know of anywhere like this that Exists along a beach? I find this much more preferable than the huge houses where\\n30+ people have to try to coordinate schedules/ preferences, etc. \\n\\nThanks!!   \n",

Because of air flights within the continent, we can only take a soft sided bag weighing no more than 33lbs. I have to double check if we’re allowed to take a separate backpack. Heading to a couple of safaris in Kenya and a gorilla trek in Uganda.\\n\\nTrying to manage the weight and stuff we only need while there, but also attire we should wear for the journey over there and back.\\n\\n- As far as electronics, plan on taking a DLSR camera and possibly an IPad. Maybe binoculars, if the weight allows. \\n- Does anyone have a sample picture of what kind of bag to take? A duffel bag?\\n- Also, when it comes to clothes, I was hoping to take advantage of laundry services so we don’t feel compelled to take too much. From what I can tell, laundry is doable, but they don’t do underwear so we’ll have to pack enough for a 12 day trip. \\n- What kind of shirts and pants should we buy? Where do we buy them? A place like REI? I was thinking throwing in a couple long sleeve dry fit Nike type shirts that could wash and dry easily. \\n- Also, when it comes to shoes, again any recommendations on type? Should we try to just take one type of shoe, or or take two different types depending on what we’re doing? \\n\\nThanks. Any insight is helpful. The 33lb weight limit makes it more interesting.   \n",

We stayed at this wonderful location that has long ago been destroyed by hurricanes. \\n\\nThis property had many tiny cottages right next to each other. Each family unit contained a small kitchen/ living room a couple of bedrooms and a bathroom. It was an ideal setup and Something I'm looking to find again. Does anyone know of a location that offers something like this?\\n\\nI know that today much larger houses with multiple bedrooms are more common. I also understand air b n b/ similar businesses have saturated the market. But if you know of something like what I'm describing please let me know!!   \n",
       "2040  Right in the heart of Mexico City, next to the financial district, there is a neighborhood where you can find all sorts of Asian stores, ramen houses, convenience stores with “kimchi available” signs on doors, and other signs of flourishing Asian community located between these streets.\\n\\nThis is the “Pequeño Seúl” or “Little Seoul”, an area where the Korean diaspora of Mexico City placed its roots. I love all things Asia and that is why I visit these streets every few days while I’m still here in Mexico City.\\n\\nIn terms of cultural domination, it is not as developed as China Town in New York City or Kampong Glam in Singapore (Muslim neighborhood with Malay and Arabic vibes). All street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly Asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game.\\n\\nHowever, you can see its authenticity by visiting any Asian grocery store. While most of the products are dried seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried noodles, and other products with long shelf life, you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge. I like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left Korea.\\n\\nBy the way, this kimchi is amazing, not like the supermarket stuff I tried before that.\\n\\nWikipedia says some of the residents of Little Seoul don’t even speak Spanish and live tightly within their own bubble. I can relate since I still don’t speak Spanish myself although I reside in Spanish-speaking countries for almost a year now.\\n\\nI love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk. It is interesting that Mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side, just like any modern nut milk — around 5% of fat content. But I’m used to the Asian coconut milk that is 18–20% of fat. My wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course.   \n",

       "1  A friend and I went backcountry camping in NM. We literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

       "1  a friend and i went backcountry camping in nm. we literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. we had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in nm, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. well, we forgot, and tsa was not forgiving of the mistake. we were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. instead they took pictures of ids and boarding pass. we were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future tsa pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for global entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). so moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping tsa can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking.

       "1  A friend and I went backcountry camping in NM. We literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

From what I’ve read, there is not potable water where we will be. I have not done a hike where there weren’t water sources so looking for suggestions on what type of vessel to take (bladder, Smart Water bottles, Nalgene, etc) and also how much to take. I will have electrolyte mix to get some bang for my buck.   \n",

I learned that for some solo travelers and nomads sometimes it's challenging for them to meet new people every time they switch to a new city. That is why I created Nomad Friend Groups, free telegram groups that you can hop in and meet other travelers with over 200+ cities around the world!    \\n\\n\\nIntroducing: [nomadfriendgroups.com/groups](https://nomadfriendgroups.com/groups)    \\n\\n\\nGoing to Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sydney, NYC, Rio, Warsaw, Beijing, Mumbai, Anywhere?  We have you covered! Hop in and see our list of groups.    \\n\\n\\nI am also looking or admins to represent each city. Reach out to me personally on telegram if you are interested. I would love to have you on board to help grow these groups!   \n",

       "1  a friend and i went backcountry camping in nm. we literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. we had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in nm, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. well, we forgot, and tsa was not forgiving of the mistake. we were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. instead they took pictures of ids and boarding pass. we were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future tsa pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for global entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). so moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping tsa can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance.

       "      <td>Right in the heart of Mexico City, next to the financial district, there is a neighborhood where you can find all sorts of Asian stores, ramen houses, convenience stores with “kimchi available” signs on doors, and other signs of flourishing Asian community located between these streets.\\n\\nThis is the “Pequeño Seúl” or “Little Seoul”, an area where the Korean diaspora of Mexico City placed its roots. I love all things Asia and that is why I visit these streets every few days while I’m still here in Mexico City.\\n\\nIn terms of cultural domination, it is not as developed as China Town in New York City or Kampong Glam in Singapore (Muslim neighborhood with Malay and Arabic vibes). All street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly Asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game.\\n\\nHowever, you can see its authenticity by visiting any Asian grocery store. While most of the products are dried seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried noodles, and other products with long shelf life, you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge. I like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left Korea.\\n\\nBy the way, this kimchi is amazing, not like the supermarket stuff I tried before that.\\n\\nWikipedia says some of the residents of Little Seoul don’t even speak Spanish and live tightly within their own bubble. I can relate since I still don’t speak Spanish myself although I reside in Spanish-speaking countries for almost a year now.\\n\\nI love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk. It is interesting that Mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side, just like any modern nut milk — around 5% of fat content. But I’m used to the Asian coconut milk that is 18–20% of fat. My wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course.</td>\n",

We literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking. Anxiously awaiting said letter and hoping TSA can be forgiving of an honest mistake.   \n",

From what I’ve read, there is not potable water where we will be. I have not done a hike where there weren’t water sources so looking for suggestions on what type of vessel to take (bladder, Smart Water bottles, Nalgene, etc) and also how much to take. I will have electrolyte mix to get some bang for my buck.   \n",

I learned that for some solo travelers and nomads sometimes it's challenging for them to meet new people every time they switch to a new city. That is why I created Nomad Friend Groups, free telegram groups that you can hop in and meet other travelers with over 200+ cities around the world!    \\n\\n\\nIntroducing: [nomadfriendgroups.com/groups](https://nomadfriendgroups.com/groups)    \\n\\n\\nGoing to Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sydney, NYC, Rio, Warsaw, Beijing, Mumbai, Anywhere?

We stayed in an area that had small, identical cabins on the beach. Each cabin had a small living room/ kitchen, one bathroom and maybe two bedrooms. These cabins were all destroyed several years ago by a hurricane. \\n\\nI am looking for something similar for a possible future vacation. Does anyone know of anywhere like this that Exists along a beach? I find this much more preferable than the huge houses where\\n30+ people have to try to coordinate schedules/ preferences, etc. \\n\\nThanks!!   \n",

Because of air flights within the continent, we can only take a soft sided bag weighing no more than 33lbs. I have to double check if we’re allowed to take a separate backpack. Heading to a couple of safaris in Kenya and a gorilla trek in Uganda.\\n\\nTrying to manage the weight and stuff we only need while there, but also attire we should wear for the journey over there and back.\\n\\n- As far as electronics, plan on taking a DLSR camera and possibly an IPad. Maybe binoculars, if the weight allows. \\n- Does anyone have a sample picture of what kind of bag to take? A duffel bag?\\n- Also, when it comes to clothes, I was hoping to take advantage of laundry services so we don’t feel compelled to take too much. From what I can tell, laundry is doable, but they don’t do underwear so we’ll have to pack enough for a 12 day trip. \\n- What kind of shirts and pants should we buy? Where do we buy them? A place like REI? I was thinking throwing in a couple long sleeve dry fit Nike type shirts that could wash and dry easily. \\n- Also, when it comes to shoes, again any recommendations on type? Should we try to just take one type of shoe, or or take two different types depending on what we’re doing? \\n\\nThanks. Any insight is helpful. The 33lb weight limit makes it more interesting.   \n",

We stayed at this wonderful location that has long ago been destroyed by hurricanes. \\n\\nThis property had many tiny cottages right next to each other. Each family unit contained a small kitchen/ living room a couple of bedrooms and a bathroom. It was an ideal setup and Something I'm looking to find again. Does anyone know of a location that offers something like this?\\n\\nI know that today much larger houses with multiple bedrooms are more common. I also understand air b n b/ similar businesses have saturated the market. But if you know of something like what I'm describing please let me know!!   \n",
       "2037  Right in the heart of Mexico City, next to the financial district, there is a neighborhood where you can find all sorts of Asian stores, ramen houses, convenience stores with “kimchi available” signs on doors, and other signs of flourishing Asian community located between these streets.\\n\\nThis is the “Pequeño Seúl” or “Little Seoul”, an area where the Korean diaspora of Mexico City placed its roots. I love all things Asia and that is why I visit these streets every few days while I’m still here in Mexico City.\\n\\nIn terms of cultural domination, it is not as developed as China Town in New York City or Kampong Glam in Singapore (Muslim neighborhood with Malay and Arabic vibes). All street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly Asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game.\\n\\nHowever, you can see its authenticity by visiting any Asian grocery store. While most of the products are dried seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried noodles, and other products with long shelf life, you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge. I like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left Korea.\\n\\nBy the way, this kimchi is amazing, not like the supermarket stuff I tried before that.\\n\\nWikipedia says some of the residents of Little Seoul don’t even speak Spanish and live tightly within their own bubble. I can relate since I still don’t speak Spanish myself although I reside in Spanish-speaking countries for almost a year now.\\n\\nI love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk. It is interesting that Mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side, just like any modern nut milk — around 5% of fat content. But I’m used to the Asian coconut milk that is 18–20% of fat. My wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course.   \n",

       "2037  right in the heart of mexico city, next to the financial district, there is a neighborhood where you can find all sorts of asian stores, ramen houses, convenience stores with “kimchi available” signs on doors, and other signs of flourishing asian community located between these streets.\\n\\nthis is the “pequeño seúl” or “little seoul”, an area where the korean diaspora of mexico city placed its roots. i love all things asia and that is why i visit these streets every few days while i’m still here in mexico city.\\n\\nin terms of cultural domination, it is not as developed as china town in new york city or kampong glam in singapore (muslim neighborhood with malay and arabic vibes). all street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game.\\n\\nhowever, you can see its authenticity by visiting any asian grocery store. while most of the products are dried seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried noodles, and other products with long shelf life, you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge. i like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left korea.\\n\\nby the way, this kimchi is amazing, not like the supermarket stuff i tried before that.\\n\\nwikipedia says some of the residents of little seoul don’t even speak spanish and live tightly within their own bubble. i can relate since i still don’t speak spanish myself although i reside in spanish-speaking countries for almost a year now.\\n\\ni love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk. it is interesting that mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side, just like any modern nut milk — around % of fat content. but i’m used to the asian coconut milk that is –% of fat. my wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course.   \n",

       "2037  right in the heart of mexico city next to the financial district there is a neighborhood where you can find all sorts of asian stores ramen houses convenience stores with kimchi available signs on doors and other signs of flourishing asian community located between these streets this is the pequeño seúl or little seoul an area where the korean diaspora of mexico city placed its roots i love all things asia and that is why i visit these streets every few days while i’m still here in mexico city in terms of cultural domination it is not as developed as china town in new york city or kampong glam in singapore muslim neighborhood with malay and arabic vibes all street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game however you can see its authenticity by visiting any asian grocery store while most of the products are dried seaweed dried mushrooms dried noodles and other products with long shelf life you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge i like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left korea by the way this kimchi is amazing not like the supermarket stuff i tried before that wikipedia says some of the residents of little seoul don’t even speak spanish and live tightly within their own bubble i can relate since i still don’t speak spanish myself although i reside in spanish speaking countries for almost a year now i love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk it is interesting that mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side just like any modern nut milk around of fat content but i’m used to the asian coconut milk that is of fat my wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course    \n",

       "2037  right in the heart of mexico city next to the financial district there is a neighborhood where you can find all sort of asian store ramen house convenience store with kimchi available sign on door and other sign of flourishing asian community located between these street this is the pequeño seúl or little seoul an area where the korean diaspora of mexico city placed it root i love all thing asia and that is why i visit these street every few day while i’m still here in mexico city in term of cultural domination it is not a developed a china town in new york city or kampong glam in singapore muslim neighborhood with malay and arabic vibe all street food stall still serve taco and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly asian uncle playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncle standing around them watching the game however you can see it authenticity by visiting any asian grocery store while most of the product are dried seaweed dried mushroom dried noodle and other product with long shelf life you can also find plastic jar with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge i like to think that some old lady living next to this shop make it just like her mother taught her before she left korea by the way this kimchi is amazing not like the supermarket stuff i tried before that wikipedia say some of the resident of little seoul don’t even speak spanish and live tightly within their own bubble i can relate since i still don’t speak spanish myself although i reside in spanish speaking country for almost a year now i love to come to that area to buy kimchi a well a some coconut milk it is interesting that mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side just like any modern nut milk around of fat content but i’m used to the asian coconut milk that is of fat my wife us it in smoothy and curry of course   \n",

Two of those experiences were long hikes, and though I didn’t have much part in putting those trips together, the experience I gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more. Fast forward to today where I’m 31 and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints I had as a kid, and I might as well have been starting from scratch. My hiking partner and I have been busy taking mid-length adventures for the past 5 years, though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale. After a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date, we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the Uinta Highline Trail in Utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work. We took a short period of planning, finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go.\\n\\n**Travel 8/5-8/6**\\n\\nAs a car guy, I for one was really excited because not only do I enjoy a long road trip, but this would be the first opportunity I got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure. Since purchasing my Tacoma in 2019 I’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping / adventure rig and I’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner. \\n\\nI got everything packed up, cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight. As I’m opening the back up to load his gear, he looks at me and exclaims, “Look what I got! 35L!” He’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package. Things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means I might have overthought some things. I immediately picture my 50L packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food, yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back. It’ll work itself out, perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go!\\n\\nWe took off for the 2 hour drive north to camp for the night in Flagstaff. As someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation, one concern I have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner. I was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in Flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at 7k+ feet of elevation. This should surely help, right?\\n\\nAfter a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning, we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone: snagging a breakfast burrito. This turned out to be quite the meal and while I do not have any pictures to share, take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal. Knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future, I quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go.\\n\\nThe next few hours on the way to the Eastern Terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the Navajo Nation, but began to pick up as we crossed through places like Moab, UT, Northwestern Colorado, etc. One thing that was clear though was the sky. Thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come, we hit about an hour out from the trailhead. At this point things really began to change; the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid-afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post-apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive. \\n\\nWe knew going into this that there were some fires in the area, but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next...</td>\n",

Keep reading to learn more about China facts and secrets.\\n\\n***Wave The Flag***\\n\\nThe Chinese flag has a red background with five golden stars in the upper left corner. Red stands for the blood of the Chinese and it’s also the main color of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); often worn at weddings and festivals for good luck. The large star is for the Chinese communist party, the smaller stars represent the different groups in the country.\\n\\nAll the five stars united together to defeat [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/) in WWII. “Zeng Liansong” designed the current flag when the communist government started a new flag designing competition in 1949. He said he was inspired by the Soviet flag.\\n\\n***Sing Along***\\n\\nThe national anthem of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is called “The March of the Volunteers”. In 1935, the anthem was written by “Tian Han” and composed by “Nie Er” who both took part in the resistance to the Japanese invasion. It was written in the Vernacular –the public language- rather than the classical Chinese to reach a larger audience and encourage the Chinese people to resist the Japanese invaders.\\n\\n***Pin on the Map***\\n\\nChina lies in south-east Asia facing the Pacific Ocean, [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)shares borders with 14 countries; the summit of Mount Everest of the Himalayas is a border-line between China and Nepal.\\n\\nThe summit of Mount Everest is a boarder-line between [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and Nepal\\n\\n[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is the 4th largest country in the world and the second-biggest nation in Asia after Russia.\\n\\n[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)has over 1.500 flowing rivers; the main rivers are the Yellow River in the north and the Yangtze River in the south. Both rivers originate from the Tibetan plateau.\\n\\n***Flora and Fauna***\\n\\nThe pure water of China’s rivers has a great impact on the diversity of the Chinese wildlife with over 30,000 plant species such as [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)Fir, Yunnan Cypress, The happy tree and Bamboo.\\n\\nThe Chinese used the native plants in cooking, medical potions and offerings to God as Buddhists believe that those plants are holy. The plants provide home and food for over 4,400 animal species such as pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, Chinese pheasant and Bactrian camel.\\n\\n***Look at the History Book***\\n\\n***The First Dynasty***\\n\\nThousands of years ago, the yellow river flooded every year and destroyed crops of rice and silk. That changed when an engineer, called “Yu”, spent 13 years digging canals and waterways that redirected the floods into new fields. “Yu” saved the farmers’ lives, so he was named king and his family started the very first Dynasty of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/): The “Xia” Dynasty.\\n\\n***The First United Chinese Empire*** All the following dynasties were small, separated by rivers, and rapidly fell apart. By 221 BCE, “Qin Shi Huang” became the first emperor to unite most of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)under the rule of the “Qin” Dynasty. He set laws and had a governmental system of ministries. The Qin Empire is pronounced “CH-in”. This unified empire gave birth to today’s “CH-IN-A”.\\n\\n***The Story Behind The Wall*** Emperor “Qin” saw the Pacific Ocean and the Tibetan plateau as natural defenses. He started building a barrier against the Turkish, the Mongols and the Xiongnu in the north. He called it the long wall.\\n\\nIn the 13th century, the Mongols breached the long wall under the leadership of “Genghis Khan”. ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is a bit of a niche post, but I just wanted to share a bit about a friend and I's experience backpacking near Karakol in Kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in Central Asia. Also recognize I’m going to get roasted for this, but I wish I had this information before attempting this trail and I hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. We are somewhat experienced backpackers (I did 200ish miles of the Colorado Trail last summer, we hiked portions of Shenandoah together in October 2020, he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in Kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. We based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization Destination Karakol and from the travel blog Against the Compass. We decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. In terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on AllTrails Pro and on Maps.Me. I thought about putting waypoints into my Garmin inReach mini, but decided against it. We also considered buying paper maps from Destination Karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. \\n\\nThe first trek we planned was up and over Archa Tör pass at \\~12,800 feet. The day breakdown for that hike was basically an 18 mile day one, 6 mile day two, and roughly 10-12 mile day three, ending in the resort of Jeti-Oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to Karakol. The first day started from the town of Kyzyl-Suu, about thirty minutes west of our AirBnb in Karakol. We took a shared taxi from the Southern Bus Station at the corner of Toktogul and Torgoeva Streets (a little north of the Afghan and Pushkin Parks) which cost 70 Som (\\~85 cents) each to Kyzyl-Suu. From there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both Maps.Me and AllTrails, roughly 6-7 miles from the town. It is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. Past the checkpoint was another about 5-6 miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. The scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. Around 15 miles from the town of Kyzyl-Suu on the trail (which still was basically a 4X4 road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. After this it was another 3ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on AllTrails split into two. It was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about 8,300 feet. \\n\\nAfter a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over 3000 feet of gain, only about 6 miles. At the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. The right was what it seemed like Against the Compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on AllTrails. The trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \\~100 som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic Kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. After that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a 4X4 road, before turning into single-track maybe 2 miles from where we camped the night prior. A half mile from there or so the AllTrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about 10,000 feet (from maybe 9,000-9,200 feet) over like 1-1.5 miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. We decided (wrongly) to go to the right. The trail disappeared no more than 10 minutes after the split and sent u...</td>\n",

We also used the book “Around &amp;amp; About Mount Hood” by Sonia Buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. \\n\\nMost Valuable Possession (MVP): I would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. Sunscreen and a hat were also critical. I lathered up so much I barely even came away with a tan. \\n\\nLeast Valuable Possession (LVP): My raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.\\n\\nI don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the PCT, and resources I found online. They are not exact.\\n\\nDay 1: \\n\\nMy dad and I started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. We both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. On our first day the high was 103 degrees in Portland and in the mid 90’s at Timberline Lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over 100 degrees once you add in the humidity). \\n\\nWe did the trail clockwise after seeing another Reddit post about the west side having more shade. Given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. At every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. We took the Paradise Park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of Mount Hood and meadows full of wildflowers. \\n\\nAlong with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. Because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around 5.3 miles rather than the 9 we originally planned for. We found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which I enjoyed from my hammock.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[The smoky view from Paradise Park](https://preview.redd.it/hzmhh8c0lkn71.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=047695efde281ac76b0107edf0fa98402f030baf)\\n\\nDay 2: \\n\\nWe did 13.5 miles on day 2 to make up for our short first day. This was a challenging day for multiple factors. For a stretch of at least 5 miles, there were biting flies. Although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), I couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. Funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!\\n\\nWe also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in August 2020, causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. While we took the reroute on the PCT before joining back up with the Timberline Trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. The trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.\\n\\nWe had our first significant water crossing, Sandy River. Looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing I still took my time getting across. There were rocks and then a thin log to cross on. \\n\\nWe went through a section of burnt out forest from the 2011 Dollar Lake fire, which was uniquely beautiful with its white, ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens.The wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably, leading to some breathtaking vistas.

       "      <td>Hey all. Just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy, and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often. A **Kifaru Minkeg.**\\n\\n[Minikeg – Kifaru International](https://kifaru.net/store/packs/day-packs/minikeg/)\\n\\nAfter owning many packs (Gorucks, TAD, Osprey, Mystery Ranch etc) this is my unicorn.\\n\\nFor those of you that dont know, Kifaru are a US based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the USA from top line products (Xpac, 500 denier nylon, ITW, YKK etc). Their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of 100kg+).\\n\\nSo as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.\\n\\nTheir packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. However they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the 1,000 USD mark.\\n\\nThe pack in question here however is an outlier for Kifaru - its the Minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the 22 x 14 x 9 mark. Cost is high at 370 USD, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like TAD, Mystery Ranch, Goruck etc.\\n\\nFirst - the Pics:\\n\\n[Kifaru Minikeg - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/geuu9wZ)\\n\\nFrom the manufacturer:\\n\\n**MINIKEG SPECS / FEATURES**  \\n– **Weight:** 2.85 lbs / 1.3 kg w/ Long SS, no belt  \\n– **Weight:** 3.39 lbs / 1.5 kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium WB (using roll top lid)  \\n– **Fabric:** 500d DWR coated Cordura / Xpac  \\n– **Total capacity:** 2800 ci / 45.8 L  \\n– Capacity with snow collar as lid: 2300 ci / 37.7 L  \\n– Main compartment dimensions: 11.5″ / 29cm wide x 9″ / 23cm depth x 29″ / 73.5cm height (22\" /55cms with snow collar as lid)  \\n– Opening circumference: 37.5″ / 95cm  \\n– Internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  \\n– Chamber pocket  \\n– Duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance. (Included)  \\n– 22″ Composite or aluminum stays  \\n– Dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps  \\n– Bottom compression straps  \\n– Grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack\\n\\n**Carry on capability (size)**\\n\\nI've included pictures above of the measurements. Generally they're pretty accurate; with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over 22\" (but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are 22 inches and flexible to boot) and less than 14\" wide (closer to 12\"). The only problem with size is the depth, with the main bag itself being 9\" (so fine) but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this, plus the hip-belt is pretty clunky as well.\\n\\nThat said, it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed, but I would definitely take off the hip-belt to make sure, and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out.\\n\\n**Carry on capability (weight)**\\n\\nThe pack (as I have it set up) is listed at 1.5kgs (mine weighed in at 1.7kgs stock) so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has, that's actually pretty good.

Two of those experiences were long hikes, and though I didn’t have much part in putting those trips together, the experience I gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more. Fast forward to today where I’m 31 and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints I had as a kid, and I might as well have been starting from scratch. My hiking partner and I have been busy taking mid-length adventures for the past 5 years, though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale. After a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date, we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the Uinta Highline Trail in Utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work. We took a short period of planning, finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go.\\n\\n**Travel 8/5-8/6**\\n\\nAs a car guy, I for one was really excited because not only do I enjoy a long road trip, but this would be the first opportunity I got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure. Since purchasing my Tacoma in 2019 I’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping / adventure rig and I’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner. \\n\\nI got everything packed up, cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight. As I’m opening the back up to load his gear, he looks at me and exclaims, “Look what I got! 35L!” He’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package. Things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means I might have overthought some things. I immediately picture my 50L packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food, yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back. It’ll work itself out, perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go!\\n\\nWe took off for the 2 hour drive north to camp for the night in Flagstaff. As someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation, one concern I have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner. I was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in Flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at 7k+ feet of elevation. This should surely help, right?\\n\\nAfter a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning, we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone: snagging a breakfast burrito. This turned out to be quite the meal and while I do not have any pictures to share, take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal. Knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future, I quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go.\\n\\nThe next few hours on the way to the Eastern Terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the Navajo Nation, but began to pick up as we crossed through places like Moab, UT, Northwestern Colorado, etc. One thing that was clear though was the sky. Thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come, we hit about an hour out from the trailhead. At this point things really began to change; the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid-afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post-apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive. \\n\\nWe knew going into this that there were some fires in the area, but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next...   \n",

Red stands for the blood of the Chinese and it’s also the main color of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); often worn at weddings and festivals for good luck. The large star is for the Chinese communist party, the smaller stars represent the different groups in the country.\\n\\nAll the five stars united together to defeat [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/) in WWII. “Zeng Liansong” designed the current flag when the communist government started a new flag designing competition in 1949. He said he was inspired by the Soviet flag.\\n\\n***Sing Along***\\n\\nThe national anthem of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is called “The March of the Volunteers”. In 1935, the anthem was written by “Tian Han” and composed by “Nie Er” who both took part in the resistance to the Japanese invasion.

       "739  This is a bit of a niche post, but I just wanted to share a bit about a friend and I's experience backpacking near Karakol in Kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in Central Asia. Also recognize I’m going to get roasted for this, but I wish I had this information before attempting this trail and I hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. We are somewhat experienced backpackers (I did 200ish miles of the Colorado Trail last summer, we hiked portions of Shenandoah together in October 2020, he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in Kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. We based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization Destination Karakol and from the travel blog Against the Compass. We decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. In terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on AllTrails Pro and on Maps.Me. I thought about putting waypoints into my Garmin inReach mini, but decided against it. We also considered buying paper maps from Destination Karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. \\n\\nThe first trek we planned was up and over Archa Tör pass at \\~12,800 feet. The day breakdown for that hike was basically an 18 mile day one, 6 mile day two, and roughly 10-12 mile day three, ending in the resort of Jeti-Oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to Karakol. The first day started from the town of Kyzyl-Suu, about thirty minutes west of our AirBnb in Karakol. We took a shared taxi from the Southern Bus Station at the corner of Toktogul and Torgoeva Streets (a little north of the Afghan and Pushkin Parks) which cost 70 Som (\\~85 cents) each to Kyzyl-Suu. From there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both Maps.Me and AllTrails, roughly 6-7 miles from the town. It is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. Past the checkpoint was another about 5-6 miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. The scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. Around 15 miles from the town of Kyzyl-Suu on the trail (which still was basically a 4X4 road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. After this it was another 3ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on AllTrails split into two. It was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about 8,300 feet. \\n\\nAfter a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over 3000 feet of gain, only about 6 miles. At the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. The right was what it seemed like Against the Compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on AllTrails. The trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \\~100 som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic Kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. After that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a 4X4 road, before turning into single-track maybe 2 miles from where we camped the night prior. A half mile from there or so the AllTrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about 10,000 feet (from maybe 9,000-9,200 feet) over like 1-1.5 miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. We decided (wrongly) to go to the right. The trail disappeared no more than 10 minutes after the split and sent u...   \n",
       "83   **Trip Report: Timberline Trail, Mount Hood, Oregon** \\n\\nAugust 13th-August 16th\\n\\n3 nights, 4 days\\n\\nWeather: Extremely hot and sunny, fairly humid (but I’m coming from the East Coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the 90% range). \\n\\nResources: We brought the National Geographic Mount Hood Wilderness topographic map and a print out of the Oregonhikers.com Timberline Trail field guide. We also used the book “Around &amp; About Mount Hood” by Sonia Buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. \\n\\nMost Valuable Possession (MVP): I would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. Sunscreen and a hat were also critical. I lathered up so much I barely even came away with a tan. \\n\\nLeast Valuable Possession (LVP): My raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.\\n\\nI don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the PCT, and resources I found online. They are not exact.\\n\\nDay 1: \\n\\nMy dad and I started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. We both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. On our first day the high was 103 degrees in Portland and in the mid 90’s at Timberline Lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over 100 degrees once you add in the humidity). \\n\\nWe did the trail clockwise after seeing another Reddit post about the west side having more shade. Given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. At every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. We took the Paradise Park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of Mount Hood and meadows full of wildflowers. \\n\\nAlong with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. Because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around 5.3 miles rather than the 9 we originally planned for. We found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which I enjoyed from my hammock.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[The smoky view from Paradise Park](https://preview.redd.it/hzmhh8c0lkn71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=047695efde281ac76b0107edf0fa98402f030baf)\\n\\nDay 2: \\n\\nWe did 13.5 miles on day 2 to make up for our short first day. This was a challenging day for multiple factors. For a stretch of at least 5 miles, there were biting flies. Although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), I couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. Funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!\\n\\nWe also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in August 2020, causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. While we took the reroute on the PCT before joining back up with the Timberline Trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. The trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.\\n\\nWe had our first significant water crossing, Sandy River. Looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing I still took my time getting across.

       "681   Hey all. Just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy, and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often. A **Kifaru Minkeg.**\\n\\n[Minikeg – Kifaru International](https://kifaru.net/store/packs/day-packs/minikeg/)\\n\\nAfter owning many packs (Gorucks, TAD, Osprey, Mystery Ranch etc) this is my unicorn.\\n\\nFor those of you that dont know, Kifaru are a US based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the USA from top line products (Xpac, 500 denier nylon, ITW, YKK etc). Their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of 100kg+).\\n\\nSo as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.\\n\\nTheir packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. However they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the 1,000 USD mark.\\n\\nThe pack in question here however is an outlier for Kifaru - its the Minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the 22 x 14 x 9 mark. Cost is high at 370 USD, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like TAD, Mystery Ranch, Goruck etc.\\n\\nFirst - the Pics:\\n\\n[Kifaru Minikeg - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/geuu9wZ)\\n\\nFrom the manufacturer:\\n\\n**MINIKEG SPECS / FEATURES**  \\n– **Weight:** 2.85 lbs / 1.3 kg w/ Long SS, no belt  \\n– **Weight:** 3.39 lbs / 1.5 kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium WB (using roll top lid)  \\n– **Fabric:** 500d DWR coated Cordura / Xpac  \\n– **Total capacity:** 2800 ci / 45.8 L  \\n– Capacity with snow collar as lid: 2300 ci / 37.7 L  \\n– Main compartment dimensions: 11.5″ / 29cm wide x 9″ / 23cm depth x 29″ / 73.5cm height (22\" /55cms with snow collar as lid)  \\n– Opening circumference: 37.5″ / 95cm  \\n– Internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  \\n– Chamber pocket  \\n– Duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance. (Included)  \\n– 22″ Composite or aluminum stays  \\n– Dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps  \\n– Bottom compression straps  \\n– Grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack\\n\\n**Carry on capability (size)**\\n\\nI've included pictures above of the measurements. Generally they're pretty accurate; with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over 22\" (but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are 22 inches and flexible to boot) and less than 14\" wide (closer to 12\"). The only problem with size is the depth, with the main bag itself being 9\" (so fine) but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this, plus the hip-belt is pretty clunky as well.\\n\\nThat said, it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed, but I would definitely take off the hip-belt to make sure, and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out.\\n\\n**Carry on capability (weight)**\\n\\nThe pack (as I have it set up) is listed at 1.5kgs (mine weighed in at 1.7kgs stock) so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has, that's actually pretty good. Its no UL pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters, but it's no slouch either, and the comfort and durability leave UL packs dead in the water. \\n\\nI've always been of the view that I am prepared to pay an extra 0.5 - 1kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back-country, and is a dream to carry.\\n\\nHowever, note when you start adding extras (as I have) the weight increases.\\n\\nOn my pack I added the Sherman pocket (an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail, and a quick grab pocket and adds 8L + stuff...   \n",

       "739  this is a bit of a niche post, but i just wanted to share a bit about a friend and i's experience backpacking near karakol in kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in central asia. also recognize i’m going to get roasted for this, but i wish i had this information before attempting this trail and i hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. we are somewhat experienced backpackers (i did ish miles of the colorado trail last summer, we hiked portions of shenandoah together in october , he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. we based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization destination karakol and from the travel blog against the compass. we decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. in terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on alltrails pro and on maps.me. i thought about putting waypoints into my garmin inreach mini, but decided against it. we also considered buying paper maps from destination karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. \\n\\nthe first trek we planned was up and over archa tör pass at \\~, feet. the day breakdown for that hike was basically an  mile day one,  mile day two, and roughly - mile day three, ending in the resort of jeti-oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to karakol. the first day started from the town of kyzyl-suu, about thirty minutes west of our airbnb in karakol. we took a shared taxi from the southern bus station at the corner of toktogul and torgoeva streets (a little north of the afghan and pushkin parks) which cost  som (\\~ cents) each to kyzyl-suu. from there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both maps.me and alltrails, roughly - miles from the town. it is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. past the checkpoint was another about - miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. the scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. around  miles from the town of kyzyl-suu on the trail (which still was basically a x road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. after this it was another ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on alltrails split into two. it was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about , feet. \\n\\nafter a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over  feet of gain, only about  miles. at the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. the right was what it seemed like against the compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on alltrails. the trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \\~ som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. after that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a x road, before turning into single-track maybe  miles from where we camped the night prior. a half mile from there or so the alltrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about , feet (from maybe ,-, feet) over like -. miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. we decided (wrongly) to go to the right. the trail disappeared no more than  minutes after the split and sent us basically crawling up the banks of a tributary and then climbin...   \n",
       "83   **trip report: timberline trail, mount hood, oregon** \\n\\naugust th-august th\\n\\n nights,  days\\n\\nweather: extremely hot and sunny, fairly humid (but i’m coming from the east coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the % range). \\n\\nresources: we brought the national geographic mount hood wilderness topographic map and a print out of the oregonhikers.com timberline trail field guide. we also used the book “around  about mount hood” by sonia buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. \\n\\nmost valuable possession (mvp): i would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. sunscreen and a hat were also critical. i lathered up so much i barely even came away with a tan. \\n\\nleast valuable possession (lvp): my raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.\\n\\ni don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the pct, and resources i found online. they are not exact.\\n\\nday : \\n\\nmy dad and i started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. we both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. on our first day the high was  degrees in portland and in the mid ’s at timberline lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over  degrees once you add in the humidity). \\n\\nwe did the trail clockwise after seeing another reddit post about the west side having more shade. given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. at every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. we took the paradise park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of mount hood and meadows full of wildflowers. \\n\\nalong with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around . miles rather than the  we originally planned for. we found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which i enjoyed from my hammock.\\n\\n\\n\\n[the smoky view from paradise park](\\n\\nday : \\n\\nwe did . miles on day  to make up for our short first day. this was a challenging day for multiple factors. for a stretch of at least  miles, there were biting flies. although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), i couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!\\n\\nwe also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in august , causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. while we took the reroute on the pct before joining back up with the timberline trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. the trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.\\n\\nwe had our first significant water crossing, sandy river. looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing i still took my time getting across. there were rocks and then a thin log to cross on. \\n\\nwe went through a section of burnt out forest from the  dollar lake fire, which was uniquely beautiful with its white, ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens.the wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably, leading to some breathtaking vistas. we had views of mount st. helens and mount adams in the distance. we also met numerous people who were trail running the whole thing in a day. although i’m incredibly impressed with their endurance, that sounds miserable to me!\\n\\nwe took the eden park detour at the recommendation of our guidebook (she specifically describes it as “one of the jewel...   \n",
       "681  hey all. just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy, and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often. a **kifaru minkeg.**\\n\\n[minikeg – kifaru international](\\n\\nafter owning many packs (gorucks, tad, osprey, mystery ranch etc) this is my unicorn.\\n\\nfor those of you that dont know, kifaru are a us based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the usa from top line products (xpac,  denier nylon, itw, ykk etc). their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of kg+).\\n\\nso as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.\\n\\ntheir packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. however they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the , usd mark.\\n\\nthe pack in question here however is an outlier for kifaru - its the minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the  x  x  mark. cost is high at  usd, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like tad, mystery ranch, goruck etc.\\n\\nfirst - the pics:\\n\\n[kifaru minikeg - imgur](\\n\\nfrom the manufacturer:\\n\\n**minikeg specs / features**  \\n– **weight:** . lbs / . kg w/ long ss, no belt  \\n– **weight:** . lbs / . kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium wb (using roll top lid)  \\n– **fabric:** d dwr coated cordura / xpac  \\n– **total capacity:**  ci / . l  \\n– capacity with snow collar as lid:  ci / . l  \\n– main compartment dimensions: .″ / cm wide x ″ / cm depth x ″ / .cm height (\" /cms with snow collar as lid)  \\n– opening circumference: .″ / cm  \\n– internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  \\n– chamber pocket  \\n– duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance.

       "343  uht trip report miles ft of ascent initial thoughts as a kid i’d grown up in scouts and with a father who loved and frequented the wilderness with me alongside and as a result i had the opportunity to take part in many week long adventures in nature two of those experiences were long hikes and though i didn’t have much part in putting those trips together the experience i gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more fast forward to today where i’m and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints i had as a kid and i might as well have been starting from scratch my hiking partner and i have been busy taking mid length adventures for the past years though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale after a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the uinta highline trail in utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work we took a short period of planning finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go travel as a car guy i for one was really excited because not only do i enjoy a long road trip but this would be the first opportunity i got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure since purchasing my tacoma in i’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping adventure rig and i’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner i got everything packed up cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight as i’m opening the back up to load his gear he looks at me and exclaims look what i got l he’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means i might have overthought some things i immediately picture my l packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back it’ll work itself out perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go we took off for the hour drive north to camp for the night in flagstaff as someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation one concern i have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner i was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at k feet of elevation this should surely help right after a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone snagging a breakfast burrito this turned out to be quite the meal and while i do not have any pictures to share take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future i quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go the next few hours on the way to the eastern terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the navajo nation but began to pick up as we crossed through places like moab ut northwestern colorado etc one thing that was clear though was the sky thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come we hit about an hour out from the trailhead at this point things really began to change the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive we knew going into this that there were some fires in the area but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next week or so the scene at the trailhead was nothing short of sobering as the sun began to fade and i scrambled to finish packing my bag sobering in the sense that we were about to head into a smoke fille...   \n",

       "739  this is a bit of a niche post but i just wanted to share a bit about a friend and i's experience backpacking near karakol in kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in central asia also recognize i’m going to get roasted for this but i wish i had this information before attempting this trail and i hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area we are somewhat experienced backpackers i did ish miles of the colorado trail last summer we hiked portions of shenandoah together in october he’s done some other longer hikes etc and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad we based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization destination karakol and from the travel blog against the compass we decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online both two nights and three days in terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on alltrails pro and on maps me i thought about putting waypoints into my garmin inreach mini but decided against it we also considered buying paper maps from destination karakol but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have the first trek we planned was up and over archa tör pass at feet the day breakdown for that hike was basically an mile day one mile day two and roughly mile day three ending in the resort of jeti oguz where we would catch a cheap taxi back to karakol the first day started from the town of kyzyl suu about thirty minutes west of our airbnb in karakol we took a shared taxi from the southern bus station at the corner of toktogul and torgoeva streets a little north of the afghan and pushkin parks which cost som cents each to kyzyl suu from there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both maps me and alltrails roughly miles from the town it is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint but we chose to hoof it past the checkpoint was another about miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large unfordable imo river the scenery was fine nothing spectacular yet choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option around miles from the town of kyzyl suu on the trail which still was basically a x road we hit a hot springs establishment resort type thing after this it was another ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on alltrails split into two it was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about feet after a nice night there we started on day two which was short but with over feet of gain only about miles at the start there were two options for the trail to stay on the right of the river going against the current or to go to the left the right was what it seemed like against the compass recommended but we decided to go to the left which was on alltrails the trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy boggy but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car after that the trail continued upwards mostly seeming like a x road before turning into single track maybe miles from where we camped the night prior a half mile from there or so the alltrails instructions split to the left had more consistent gain up to about feet from maybe feet over like miles the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail we decided wrongly to go to the right the trail disappeared no more than minutes after the split and sent us basically crawling up the banks of a tributary and then climbing up to a flatter section and fighting through some incredibly dense ish foot tall juvenile juniper forest this was a...   \n",
       "83   trip report timberline trail mount hood oregon august th august th nights days weather extremely hot and sunny fairly humid but i’m coming from the east coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the range resources we brought the national geographic mount hood wilderness topographic map and a print out of the oregonhikers com timberline trail field guide we also used the book around about mount hood by sonia buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight most valuable possession mvp i would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand sunscreen and a hat were also critical i lathered up so much i barely even came away with a tan least valuable possession lvp my raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag i don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map the reroute on the pct and resources i found online they are not exact day my dad and i started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory we both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures on our first day the high was degrees in portland and in the mid ’s at timberline lodge in the afternoon with the real feel being over degrees once you add in the humidity we did the trail clockwise after seeing another reddit post about the west side having more shade given the incredibly hot weather it was a no brainer at every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool we took the paradise park detour which was well worth it with gorgeous views of mount hood and meadows full of wildflowers along with being hot it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires because of these two things we cut our first day short around miles rather than the we originally planned for we found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which i enjoyed from my hammock the smoky view from paradise park day we did miles on day to make up for our short first day this was a challenging day for multiple factors for a stretch of at least miles there were biting flies although the hiking was frequently uphill blessedly shaded for many portions i couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body including my face funnily they didn’t bother my dad at all only me lucky him we also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in august causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable while we took the reroute on the pct before joining back up with the timberline trail we still encountered fallen trees across the trail slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them the trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route we had our first significant water crossing sandy river looking back it was a breeze but since it was my first legit river crossing i still took my time getting across there were rocks and then a thin log to cross on we went through a section of burnt out forest from the dollar lake fire which was uniquely beautiful with its white ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens the wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably leading to some breathtaking vistas we had views of mount st helens and mount adams in the distance we also met numerous people who were trail running the whole thing in a day although i’m incredibly impressed with their endurance that sounds miserable to me we took the eden park detour at the recommendation of our guidebook she specifically describes it as one of the jewels of the timberline trail but personally i wouldn’t suggest it according to the nat geo map it adds an extra miles and while pretty i didn’t find it nearly as striking as parad...   \n",
       "681  hey all just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often a kifaru minkeg minikeg kifaru international after owning many packs gorucks tad osprey mystery ranch etc this is my unicorn for those of you that dont know kifaru are a us based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the usa from top line products xpac denier nylon itw ykk etc their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus with durability and heavy load hauling we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of kg so as a general rule not the sort of thing we go for around these parts their packs are rightly famous for durability load hauling ability comfort and quality however they are also equally infamous for their high cost with an external frame pack extras combo looking to push you close to the usd mark the pack in question here however is an outlier for kifaru its the minikeg a relatively lightweight and internal framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the x x mark cost is high at usd but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs and on par with peers like tad mystery ranch goruck etc first the pics kifaru minikeg imgur from the manufacturer minikeg specs features weight lbs kg w long ss no belt weight lbs kg w long shoulder straps and medium wb using roll top lid fabric d dwr coated cordura xpac total capacity ci l capacity with snow collar as lid ci l main compartment dimensions cm wide x cm depth x cm height cms with snow collar as lid opening circumference cm internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports chamber pocket duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance included composite or aluminum stays dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps bottom compression straps grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack carry on capability size i've included pictures above of the measurements generally they're pretty accurate with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are inches and flexible to boot and less than wide closer to the only problem with size is the depth with the main bag itself being so fine but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this plus the hip belt is pretty clunky as well that said it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed but i would definitely take off the hip belt to make sure and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out carry on capability weight the pack as i have it set up is listed at kgs mine weighed in at kgs stock so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has that's actually pretty good its no ul pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters but it's no slouch either and the comfort and durability leave ul packs dead in the water i've always been of the view that i am prepared to pay an extra kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back country and is a dream to carry however note when you start adding extras as i have the weight increases on my pack i added the sherman pocket an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail and a quick grab pocket and adds l stuff it capacity to the overall bag i also added belt pouches a small a mini and a roll up dump pouch from helikon tex to function as a water bottle holder on the belt a helikon tex removable framesheet containing a sea to summit tablet sleeve and some shock cord for a bungee system plus an itw nexus carabiner and webbing keepers and the spare webbing straps you need to carry if you want to run this thing without a hip belt to look a little less conspicuous boarding aircraft for example this all pushed the tota...   \n",

To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I've created this Megathread.**\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor questions on COVID Vaccine Passports please use the COVID Megathread, 1st post in /r/travel.\\n\\n___\\n\\nTHE BEST ADVICE IS APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. DO NOT CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY. \\n\\n\\n___\\n\\n**[The Spring/Summer 2021 Passport Megathread can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/nhe74a/passport_questions_issues_megathread_summer_2021/).**\\n___\\n\\n#American Passport Information \\n\\n## How to Apply\\n\\n[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).\\n\\nThere will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents &amp;amp; IDs you'll need, etc.\\n\\n##Where to Apply\\n\\n[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).\\n\\n[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).\\n\\nNOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. \\n\\n\\n##Processing Times Within the US\\nAs of September 2021, \\n\\n[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).\\n\\nNormal processing is around 18 weeks.\\n\\nExpedited processing is around 12 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)\\n\\nLife or Death/ Urgent/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.\\n\\nNOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.\\n\\nNOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel \"to the day\" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.\\n\\nNOTE: It can take up to 4 weeks before your status changes to \"In Process\".\\n\\n**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than 12 weeks BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**\\n___\\n\\n#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US\\n\\n### What is the status of my application?\\n\\nCheck here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/\\n\\n### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?\\n\\nNo. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 4-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. \\n\\nOnce they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.\\n\\n### Can I get a same day passport.\\n\\nNot likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.\\n\\n### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>15 Day Italian Honeymoon in November: Tuscany - Cinque Terre - Amalfi Coast.... questions below! Any and all input is greatly appreciated :)</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hello all,\\n\\nWe got married 1 month before Covid hit in the U.S. and have been delaying our Honeymoon until now. We were originally going in the Spring but just found out that my wife is pregnant so we decided to go asap (November being the absolute soonest due to having to wait for a Visa appointment). I know November is not the optimal time to go but it's a now or never type situation.\\n\\n**Some background:** We have previously done the traditional Rome, Florence, and Venice trip so this time around, we are trying to see entirely new places. We want to spend more time in less places. Ideally, we would love to stay in quaint towns surrounded by beautiful landscapes that are not as crowded with tourists. I know that a lot of Italy's \"hidden gems\" are not so hidden anymore so this might prove to be challenging. With that being said, it's my understanding that November is one of the least touristy months which should help!\\n\\nOur priority is charming towns/small cities, surrounded by nature, with plenty of good local food. We like to be active (walking/hiking) so while I love the idea of relaxing in front of a beach all day long, that gets old quick for us. Lastly, we are not big on art history/museums so we don't plan on going out of our way to fit that in. Budget-wise, this is our last shebang before having a baby so we want to treat ourselves.\\n\\nWe definitely want to do Tuscany and rent a car to do day trips to different places in the region. The only other place that we want to go to is the Amalfi Coast and/or Cinque Terre. I know these two are inevitably going to be super touristy but as long as most of the trip is not, we'll be happy. We fly into Florence and fly out of Rome.\\n\\nI have included some specific questions below. Outside of that, any general input, feedback, or advice would be greaattllyy appreciated! I live in Utah so should you ever plan a trip out here, I would be more than happy to reciprocate :)\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n*Tuscany*\\n\\n\\- I hear that the weather in November is cold and rainy. I still want to go and don't mind dealing with unfavorable weather in exchange for less crowds. Is it that bad that I should minimize my days in Tuscany?\\n\\n\\- Since we want to spend more time in less places, what are good cities/towns that we can stay in as a home base in Tuscany where we can do day trips out of? Two places that caught my attention were San Quirico d'Orcia and Lucca ( 2-3 days in each) since they are on opposite ends of Tuscany. Thoughts?\\n\\n\\- If I spend 5-7 days in the Tuscany region, what are some places (vineyards, restaurants, cafes, etc) should consider? For food and drink, I don't mind going out of my way for an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Cinque Terre vs. Amalfi Coast*\\n\\n\\- Time-wise, I think we have the ability to do both without spreading ourselves too thin. However, from the pictures, Cinque Terre and Amalfi appear to have a similar vibe/aesthetic. Are they different enough to justify doing both? If not, which one would you suggest? (If I only do one, I am leaning towards Amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in November but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- I will have a car in Tuscany so I would consider driving up the coast to Cinque Terre. Is this something you would recommend? Or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to Cinque Terre? If not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the Lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- Due to the time of the year, I have been told that Southern Italy has much better weather. I am open to trimming the Tuscany portion to explore more of Southern Italy. If so, what are some areas near Amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? Sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?\\n\\nThanks in advance!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yesterday I spent 20 hours traveling through 7 different airports</td>\n",
       "      <td>Yesterday I had the pleasure of spending 20 hours in 7 different airports. Here's my horror story:\\n\\nMy original itinerary was to fly from Lubbock, TX to Richmond, VA through Dallas and Atlanta on Saturday. However, after spending 3 hours in the Lubbock airport Saturday it became clear that my flights to and from Dallas would be delayed due to weather and I'd be stuck in Atlanta overnight. Instead I opted to get rebooked to the next day and spend another night in Lubbock with my girlfriend.\\n\\nMy rebooked itinerary was this: Lubbock to Dallas to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Super fun, right? 6AM to 1130PM, great. \\n\\nI show up to the airport bright and early to check my bag to Richmond, where the ticket counter agent tells me that it's too long away of an arrival time to check my bag to Richmond, so I'll need to get my bag from the baggage claim in Dallas then recheck it at the ticket counter there. Ok fine, I have 5 hours I'll be ok.\\n\\nI get to Dallas, get my bag, and go to recheck it to Richmond. I tell the agent about the crappy itinerary I have, and he actually found me a flight that would let me stay on the same plane and get me home by 6PM: Dallas to San Antonio to Chicago to Richmond. \"Awesome!\" I think, \"this is way better!\" I rebook my flights, grab a coffee, and head to San Antonio.\\n\\nIn San Antonio, where I should have been comfortably stretching waiting for the plane to board new passengers, I'm told that the plane has been switched and I need to go to a new gate. \"Weird, but fine, let me talk to a gate agent though\". Turns out there's been a mechanical issue and the new plane will be going to Chicago but not Richmond. At first she says there's no way to make it there that night and they'd put me in a hotel in Chicago. But wait! One way I'd make it there that night is if I get on a flight from San Antonio to Houston, then the last open spot on a flight from Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Of course I wasn't surprised there'd be an open spot on the flight, since it was literally the same spot I gave up this morning that got me stuck in San Antonio in the first place.\\n\\nI get on my flight from San Antonio to Houston. It's delayed, but not that much and I make it just in time to make my connection. I board in Houston and proceed to sit on the plane for an hour, then the gate for another hour, as a massive thunderstorm continues to generate directly over the airport.\\n\\nWe leave 2 and a half hours late. The leg from Houston to Memphis was completely full, the leg from Memphis to Atlanta was nearly empty, and the final leg from Atlanta to Richmond was nearly full. We land at about 1:30AM and I stumble to the baggage claim. I'll finally be home!\\n\\nMy bag isn't there. When they switched everything around in San Antonio the gate agent had no way of giving me actually confirmation that my bag was switched, just a promise that they would take care of it. I trusted them, but I guess somewhere along the line my bag got lost in the shuffle.\\n\\nAll in all, it was 20 hours of travel through 7 different airports: Lubbock to Dallas to San Antonio to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. 13 of those hours were spent in Texas, trying to navigate weather and mechanical issues. My checked bag is nowhere to be found. \\n\\nTl;dr: Try not to fly in Texas in the Summer after 1PM, you **WILL** get delayed by weather.

       "      <td>yesterday i had the pleasure of spending  hours in  different airports. here's my horror story:\\n\\nmy original itinerary was to fly from lubbock, tx to richmond, va through dallas and atlanta on saturday. however, after spending  hours in the lubbock airport saturday it became clear that my flights to and from dallas would be delayed due to weather and i'd be stuck in atlanta overnight. instead i opted to get rebooked to the next day and spend another night in lubbock with my girlfriend.\\n\\nmy rebooked itinerary was this: lubbock to dallas to houston to memphis to atlanta to richmond. super fun, right? am to pm, great. \\n\\ni show up to the airport bright and early to check my bag to richmond, where the ticket counter agent tells me that it's too long away of an arrival time to check my bag to richmond, so i'll need to get my bag from the baggage claim in dallas then recheck it at the ticket counter there. ok fine, i have  hours i'll be ok.\\n\\ni get to dallas, get my bag, and go to recheck it to richmond. i tell the agent about the crappy itinerary i have, and he actually found me a flight that would let me stay on the same plane and get me home by pm: dallas to san antonio to chicago to richmond. \"awesome!\" i think, \"this is way better!\" i rebook my flights, grab a coffee, and head to san antonio.\\n\\nin san antonio, where i should have been comfortably stretching waiting for the plane to board new passengers, i'm told that the plane has been switched and i need to go to a new gate. \"weird, but fine, let me talk to a gate agent though\". turns out there's been a mechanical issue and the new plane will be going to chicago but not richmond. at first she says there's no way to make it there that night and they'd put me in a hotel in chicago. but wait! one way i'd make it there that night is if i get on a flight from san antonio to houston, then the last open spot on a flight from houston to memphis to atlanta to richmond. of course i wasn't surprised there'd be an open spot on the flight, since it was literally the same spot i gave up this morning that got me stuck in san antonio in the first place.\\n\\ni get on my flight from san antonio to houston. it's delayed, but not that much and i make it just in time to make my connection. i board in houston and proceed to sit on the plane for an hour, then the gate for another hour, as a massive thunderstorm continues to generate directly over the airport.\\n\\nwe leave  and a half hours late. the leg from houston to memphis was completely full, the leg from memphis to atlanta was nearly empty, and the final leg from atlanta to richmond was nearly full. we land at about :am and i stumble to the baggage claim. i'll finally be home!\\n\\nmy bag isn't there. when they switched everything around in san antonio the gate agent had no way of giving me actually confirmation that my bag was switched, just a promise that they would take care of it. i trusted them, but i guess somewhere along the line my bag got lost in the shuffle.\\n\\nall in all, it was  hours of travel through  different airports: lubbock to dallas to san antonio to houston to memphis to atlanta to richmond.  of those hours were spent in texas, trying to navigate weather and mechanical issues. my checked bag is nowhere to be found. \\n\\ntl;dr: try not to fly in texas in the summer after pm, you **will** get delayed by weather. also, always bring snacks and an extra pair of clothes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi everyone. I’m planning a trip through the USA for me and my girlfriend. We don’t have an exact date yet, but we’d like to go in the summer period. \\n\\nI have planned the route out according to our mutual interests but I was wondering if someone had some advice on certain points or maybe ideas for places we shouldn’t miss. We’re the kind of travellers that enjoy passing through as much as hotspots as possible. We did several trips already with a fully loaded schedule, but always well planned so that we get to see everything in a short amount of time. And yes, people have called us crazy more then once haha.  So in general, this is our itinerary:\\n\\nDay 1: Amsterdam - Seattle (by plane). We want to visit the Hoh Rain Forest and the Boeing Museum.\\nDay 4: Seattle - Portland (with rental car all the way to Las Vegas). We thought that the Multnomah Falls and the Japanese Gardens would be cool to visit. \\nDay 7: Portland - San Francisco where we would want to check out downtown, the Golden Gate and Alcatraz\\nDay 10: San Francisco - Los Angeles where we’d have a full beach day and visits to Hollywood (and the sign ofc haha) and Beverly Hills\\nDay 14: Los Angeles - Las Vegas. Here we’d like to visit the strip ofcourse. But as we’re both not the gambling type of persons we wouldn’t want to stay for more than a night or two. \\nDay 16: Las Vegas - Santa Fe. In LV, we’d like to rent a RV and make a pitstop to slee in Santa Fe. We’d like to pass the Hoover Dam and visit The Grand Canyon.\\nDay 17: Santa Fe - Oklahoma City. This would be a driving day and the drop off for the RV. Maybe someone knows cool spots somewhere in between where we could stay or visit? Or maybe cool things in Oklahoma?\\nDay 18: Oklahoma City - St Louis (by plane). As we’re both Bosnians, we cant visit the USA without visiting St. Louis lol.\\nDay 19: St. Louis - Chicago (by rental car all the way to Washington DC). If someone has tips on nice scenic routes or hotspots on the road, please share! In Chicago we’d like to do a River cruise, check the Magnificent Mile, the famous Willis Tower and the Skydeck. \\nDay 22: Chicago - DuBois. This would be a driving day where we’d make a pitstop in DuBois.\\nDay 23: DuBois - New York City: \\tI’m a huge fan of the Big Apple. So I’d like to go all out here. This means Greenwich Village, The Vessel, North 5th Pier, Rockefeller, Central Park ofcourse and the Empire State, Ground Zero, Grand Central Station, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, SoHo, the Waldorf Astoria (only from the outside lol)\\nDay 29: New York City - Washington DC. Hellooo Joe Biden! We’d go visit the White House, The Capitol, Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian. \\nDay 32: Washington DC - New Orleans (by plane). We’d go visit the French Quarter, Garden District, Oak Alley and we were recommended to do the Ghost Tour.\\nDay 35: New Orleans - Orlando (with rental car all the way to Miami). Orlando is all about Universal Studios and Disney World for us haha. We’d stay in the Portofino one as we think he has the best scenery!\\nDay 39: Orlando- Miami. Our trio would end in Miami. I don’t know what are cool places to visit but we’d stay maybe 3-4 days and enjoy sunny days on Miami Beach. \\n\\nSo that’s it in a nutshell. If someone has tips, let me know! Budgetwise, we have something like 30k USD for everything.</td>\n",

       "1590  Despite increasing vaccination rates, with concerns about the delta variant, the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation continues to have a major effect on travel, with many now looking to understand if, when, or how their travels might be feasible. Accordingly, /r/travel is continuing its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates.\\n\\nIn the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**\\n\\n## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?\\n\\nA list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm). Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).\\n\\nYou may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**\\n\\n## ...in the US?\\n\\nAt the time of writing, *foreign nationals (regardless of vaccination status)* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in *or transited* via Brazil, China, India, Iran, Ireland, the Schengen Area, South Africa, or the UK in the preceding 14 days. Exceptions to this rule include green card holders, some family members of US citizens and permanent residents, and holders of certain visas (e.g. F-1 visas under certain circumstances, and K-1 visas). *Note that (except for, of course, US citizens) this is not a citizenship-based restriction; it is purely based on travel history.* **Because of this, those traveling from one of the restricted countries are permitted to enter the US provided they spend two weeks prior to arrival in the US in a non-restricted country.** More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the [US CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html).\\n\\n**All air passengers – regardless of origin, nationality, and vaccination status – [need to produce a negative result](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html)** from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US. Alternatively, you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that you're clear for travel. The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes, but [air, rail, and sea (but not commuter rail or ferry) ports-of-entry remain open](https://ca.usembassy.gov/travel-restrictions-fact-sheet/) to non-essential travel.\\n\\n**No nationwide quarantine requirements exist.** Some individual states and/or cities may have their own recommendations, but, outside Hawaii, these are just recommendations. **COVID tests are not being demanded at check-in, security, boarding, or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States, and checkpoints are not being set up at state borders.** Hawaii is the only state with strict testing and quarantine requirements of domestic travel.\\n\\nFor more information, see [the US CDC's COVID-19 page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).\\n\\n## ...in Canada?\\n\\nAt the time of writing, most *foreign nationals* are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain, mostly essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*. Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions. Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for non-essential purpos...   \n",
       "1067  **For the last few months we've been getting multiple posts a day on American Passport Questions. To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I've created this Megathread.**\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor questions on COVID Vaccine Passports please use the COVID Megathread, 1st post in /r/travel.\\n\\n___\\n\\nTHE BEST ADVICE IS APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. DO NOT CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY. \\n\\n\\n___\\n\\n**[The Spring/Summer 2021 Passport Megathread can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/nhe74a/passport_questions_issues_megathread_summer_2021/).**\\n___\\n\\n#American Passport Information \\n\\n## How to Apply\\n\\n[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).\\n\\nThere will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents &amp; IDs you'll need, etc.\\n\\n##Where to Apply\\n\\n[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).\\n\\n[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).\\n\\nNOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. \\n\\n\\n##Processing Times Within the US\\nAs of September 2021, \\n\\n[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).\\n\\nNormal processing is around 18 weeks.\\n\\nExpedited processing is around 12 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)\\n\\nLife or Death/ Urgent/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.\\n\\nNOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.\\n\\nNOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel \"to the day\" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.\\n\\nNOTE: It can take up to 4 weeks before your status changes to \"In Process\".\\n\\n**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than 12 weeks BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**\\n___\\n\\n#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US\\n\\n### What is the status of my application?\\n\\nCheck here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/\\n\\n### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?\\n\\nNo. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 4-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. \\n\\nOnce they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.\\n\\n### Can I get a same day passport.\\n\\nNot likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.\\n\\n### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I ...   \n",
       "1843                                                                                                              Hello all,\\n\\nWe got married 1 month before Covid hit in the U.S. and have been delaying our Honeymoon until now. We were originally going in the Spring but just found out that my wife is pregnant so we decided to go asap (November being the absolute soonest due to having to wait for a Visa appointment). I know November is not the optimal time to go but it's a now or never type situation.\\n\\n**Some background:** We have previously done the traditional Rome, Florence, and Venice trip so this time around, we are trying to see entirely new places. We want to spend more time in less places. Ideally, we would love to stay in quaint towns surrounded by beautiful landscapes that are not as crowded with tourists. I know that a lot of Italy's \"hidden gems\" are not so hidden anymore so this might prove to be challenging. With that being said, it's my understanding that November is one of the least touristy months which should help!\\n\\nOur priority is charming towns/small cities, surrounded by nature, with plenty of good local food. We like to be active (walking/hiking) so while I love the idea of relaxing in front of a beach all day long, that gets old quick for us. Lastly, we are not big on art history/museums so we don't plan on going out of our way to fit that in. Budget-wise, this is our last shebang before having a baby so we want to treat ourselves.\\n\\nWe definitely want to do Tuscany and rent a car to do day trips to different places in the region. The only other place that we want to go to is the Amalfi Coast and/or Cinque Terre. I know these two are inevitably going to be super touristy but as long as most of the trip is not, we'll be happy. We fly into Florence and fly out of Rome.\\n\\nI have included some specific questions below. Outside of that, any general input, feedback, or advice would be greaattllyy appreciated! I live in Utah so should you ever plan a trip out here, I would be more than happy to reciprocate :)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n*Tuscany*\\n\\n\\- I hear that the weather in November is cold and rainy. I still want to go and don't mind dealing with unfavorable weather in exchange for less crowds. Is it that bad that I should minimize my days in Tuscany?\\n\\n\\- Since we want to spend more time in less places, what are good cities/towns that we can stay in as a home base in Tuscany where we can do day trips out of? Two places that caught my attention were San Quirico d'Orcia and Lucca ( 2-3 days in each) since they are on opposite ends of Tuscany. Thoughts?\\n\\n\\- If I spend 5-7 days in the Tuscany region, what are some places (vineyards, restaurants, cafes, etc) should consider? For food and drink, I don't mind going out of my way for an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Cinque Terre vs. Amalfi Coast*\\n\\n\\- Time-wise, I think we have the ability to do both without spreading ourselves too thin. However, from the pictures, Cinque Terre and Amalfi appear to have a similar vibe/aesthetic. Are they different enough to justify doing both? If not, which one would you suggest? (If I only do one, I am leaning towards Amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in November but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- I will have a car in Tuscany so I would consider driving up the coast to Cinque Terre. Is this something you would recommend? Or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to Cinque Terre? If not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the Lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- Due to the time of the year, I have been told that Southern Italy has much better weather. I am open to trimming the Tuscany portion to explore more of Southern Italy. If so, what are some areas near Amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? Sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?\\n\\nThanks in advance!   \n",

Here's my horror story:\\n\\nMy original itinerary was to fly from Lubbock, TX to Richmond, VA through Dallas and Atlanta on Saturday. However, after spending 3 hours in the Lubbock airport Saturday it became clear that my flights to and from Dallas would be delayed due to weather and I'd be stuck in Atlanta overnight. Instead I opted to get rebooked to the next day and spend another night in Lubbock with my girlfriend.\\n\\nMy rebooked itinerary was this: Lubbock to Dallas to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Super fun, right? 6AM to 1130PM, great. \\n\\nI show up to the airport bright and early to check my bag to Richmond, where the ticket counter agent tells me that it's too long away of an arrival time to check my bag to Richmond, so I'll need to get my bag from the baggage claim in Dallas then recheck it at the ticket counter there. Ok fine, I have 5 hours I'll be ok.\\n\\nI get to Dallas, get my bag, and go to recheck it to Richmond. I tell the agent about the crappy itinerary I have, and he actually found me a flight that would let me stay on the same plane and get me home by 6PM: Dallas to San Antonio to Chicago to Richmond. \"Awesome!\" I think, \"this is way better!\" I rebook my flights, grab a coffee, and head to San Antonio.\\n\\nIn San Antonio, where I should have been comfortably stretching waiting for the plane to board new passengers, I'm told that the plane has been switched and I need to go to a new gate. \"Weird, but fine, let me talk to a gate agent though\". Turns out there's been a mechanical issue and the new plane will be going to Chicago but not Richmond. At first she says there's no way to make it there that night and they'd put me in a hotel in Chicago. But wait! One way I'd make it there that night is if I get on a flight from San Antonio to Houston, then the last open spot on a flight from Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Of course I wasn't surprised there'd be an open spot on the flight, since it was literally the same spot I gave up this morning that got me stuck in San Antonio in the first place.\\n\\nI get on my flight from San Antonio to Houston. It's delayed, but not that much and I make it just in time to make my connection. I board in Houston and proceed to sit on the plane for an hour, then the gate for another hour, as a massive thunderstorm continues to generate directly over the airport.\\n\\nWe leave 2 and a half hours late. The leg from Houston to Memphis was completely full, the leg from Memphis to Atlanta was nearly empty, and the final leg from Atlanta to Richmond was nearly full. We land at about 1:30AM and I stumble to the baggage claim. I'll finally be home!\\n\\nMy bag isn't there. When they switched everything around in San Antonio the gate agent had no way of giving me actually confirmation that my bag was switched, just a promise that they would take care of it. I trusted them, but I guess somewhere along the line my bag got lost in the shuffle.\\n\\nAll in all, it was 20 hours of travel through 7 different airports: Lubbock to Dallas to San Antonio to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. 13 of those hours were spent in Texas, trying to navigate weather and mechanical issues. My checked bag is nowhere to be found. \\n\\nTl;dr: Try not to fly in Texas in the Summer after 1PM, you **WILL** get delayed by weather. Also, always bring snacks and an extra pair of clothes.   \n",

I’m planning a trip through the USA for me and my girlfriend. We don’t have an exact date yet, but we’d like to go in the summer period. \\n\\nI have planned the route out according to our mutual interests but I was wondering if someone had some advice on certain points or maybe ideas for places we shouldn’t miss. We’re the kind of travellers that enjoy passing through as much as hotspots as possible. We did several trips already with a fully loaded schedule, but always well planned so that we get to see everything in a short amount of time. And yes, people have called us crazy more then once haha.  So in general, this is our itinerary:\\n\\nDay 1: Amsterdam - Seattle (by plane). We want to visit the Hoh Rain Forest and the Boeing Museum.\\nDay 4: Seattle - Portland (with rental car all the way to Las Vegas). We thought that the Multnomah Falls and the Japanese Gardens would be cool to visit. \\nDay 7: Portland - San Francisco where we would want to check out downtown, the Golden Gate and Alcatraz\\nDay 10: San Francisco - Los Angeles where we’d have a full beach day and visits to Hollywood (and the sign ofc haha) and Beverly Hills\\nDay 14: Los Angeles - Las Vegas. Here we’d like to visit the strip ofcourse. But as we’re both not the gambling type of persons we wouldn’t want to stay for more than a night or two. \\nDay 16: Las Vegas - Santa Fe. In LV, we’d like to rent a RV and make a pitstop to slee in Santa Fe. We’d like to pass the Hoover Dam and visit The Grand Canyon.\\nDay 17: Santa Fe - Oklahoma City. This would be a driving day and the drop off for the RV. Maybe someone knows cool spots somewhere in between where we could stay or visit? Or maybe cool things in Oklahoma?\\nDay 18: Oklahoma City - St Louis (by plane). As we’re both Bosnians, we cant visit the USA without visiting St. Louis lol.\\nDay 19: St. Louis - Chicago (by rental car all the way to Washington DC). If someone has tips on nice scenic routes or hotspots on the road, please share! In Chicago we’d like to do a River cruise, check the Magnificent Mile, the famous Willis Tower and the Skydeck. \\nDay 22: Chicago - DuBois. This would be a driving day where we’d make a pitstop in DuBois.\\nDay 23: DuBois - New York City: \\tI’m a huge fan of the Big Apple. So I’d like to go all out here. This means Greenwich Village, The Vessel, North 5th Pier, Rockefeller, Central Park ofcourse and the Empire State, Ground Zero, Grand Central Station, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, SoHo, the Waldorf Astoria (only from the outside lol)\\nDay 29: New York City - Washington DC. Hellooo Joe Biden! We’d go visit the White House, The Capitol, Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian. \\nDay 32: Washington DC - New Orleans (by plane). We’d go visit the French Quarter, Garden District, Oak Alley and we were recommended to do the Ghost Tour.\\nDay 35: New Orleans - Orlando (with rental car all the way to Miami). Orlando is all about Universal Studios and Disney World for us haha. We’d stay in the Portofino one as we think he has the best scenery!\\nDay 39: Orlando- Miami. Our trio would end in Miami. I don’t know what are cool places to visit but we’d stay maybe 3-4 days and enjoy sunny days on Miami Beach. \\n\\nSo that’s it in a nutshell. If someone has tips, let me know! Budgetwise, we have something like 30k USD for everything.   \n",

(if i only do one, i am leaning towards amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in november but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- i will have a car in tuscany so i would consider driving up the coast to cinque terre. is this something you would recommend? or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to cinque terre? if not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- due to the time of the year, i have been told that southern italy has much better weather. i am open to trimming the tuscany portion to explore more of southern italy. if so, what are some areas near amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?\\n\\nthanks in advance!   \n",

       "1067  for the last few months we've been getting multiple posts a day on american passport questions to help alleviate the amount of posts and make sure everyone is getting the same information i've created this megathread ___ for questions on covid vaccine passports please use the covid megathread st post in r travel ___ the best advice is apply and renew early always check your passport's expiration date put your passport in a safe and secure place where you will not lose it do not check expiration or location of passport the night before check it early ___ the spring summer passport megathread can be found here ___ american passport information how to apply all information can be found here there will be a form to fill out information on passport photos what documents ids you'll need etc where to apply then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at this could be an acceptance facility like a local usps office an actual passport agency or via mail for renewals if you are applying outside of the us please see this information note many locations still have covid protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins processing times within the us as of september you can find the latest processing times here normal processing is around weeks expedited processing is around weeks you also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility that is an added cost is an additional add on to expedited passports life or death urgent emergency service is around hours business days and you can book these appointments starting weeks from your travel date you can only make an appointment by calling or tdd tty note this timing may not include shipping time there have been issues in the past of usps causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times note some facilities may be quicker others may take longer the above time is the average we have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate do not book travel to the day of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport because again it does not include shipping times note it can take up to weeks before your status changes to in process some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than weeks but not all do not plan on being lucky get your application in early and expedited as needed ___ frequently asked questions for applying within the us what is the status of my application check here they cashed my check does that mean my passport is coming soon no during covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to weeks them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well once they start processing it if they find errors or your paperwork ids etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues can i get a same day passport not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments my trip is in a few days and i just realized i don't have my passport it's lost it's expired whatever help what do i do in all honesty you are pretty much sol it is almost impossible to get the urgent life or death emergency in person appointments for these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link if you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to including flying to them note that many people have faked life or death emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now not happening trip my trip is within the next weeks and i n...   \n",

Two of those experiences were long hikes, and though I didn’t have much part in putting those trips together, the experience I gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more. Fast forward to today where I’m 31 and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints I had as a kid, and I might as well have been starting from scratch. My hiking partner and I have been busy taking mid-length adventures for the past 5 years, though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale. After a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date, we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the Uinta Highline Trail in Utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work. We took a short period of planning, finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go.\\n\\n**Travel 8/5-8/6**\\n\\nAs a car guy, I for one was really excited because not only do I enjoy a long road trip, but this would be the first opportunity I got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure. Since purchasing my Tacoma in 2019 I’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping / adventure rig and I’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner. \\n\\nI got everything packed up, cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight. As I’m opening the back up to load his gear, he looks at me and exclaims, “Look what I got! 35L!” He’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package. Things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means I might have overthought some things. I immediately picture my 50L packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food, yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back. It’ll work itself out, perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go!\\n\\nWe took off for the 2 hour drive north to camp for the night in Flagstaff. As someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation, one concern I have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner. I was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in Flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at 7k+ feet of elevation. This should surely help, right?\\n\\nAfter a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning, we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone: snagging a breakfast burrito. This turned out to be quite the meal and while I do not have any pictures to share, take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal. Knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future, I quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go.\\n\\nThe next few hours on the way to the Eastern Terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the Navajo Nation, but began to pick up as we crossed through places like Moab, UT, Northwestern Colorado, etc. One thing that was clear though was the sky. Thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come, we hit about an hour out from the trailhead. At this point things really began to change; the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid-afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post-apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive. \\n\\nWe knew going into this that there were some fires in the area, but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next...</td>\n",

You can find all of this and much more in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Keep reading to learn more about China facts and secrets.\\n\\n***Wave The Flag***\\n\\nThe Chinese flag has a red background with five golden stars in the upper left corner. Red stands for the blood of the Chinese and it’s also the main color of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); often worn at weddings and festivals for good luck. The large star is for the Chinese communist party, the smaller stars represent the different groups in the country.\\n\\nAll the five stars united together to defeat [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/) in WWII. “Zeng Liansong” designed the current flag when the communist government started a new flag designing competition in 1949. He said he was inspired by the Soviet flag.\\n\\n***Sing Along***\\n\\nThe national anthem of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is called “The March of the Volunteers”. In 1935, the anthem was written by “Tian Han” and composed by “Nie Er” who both took part in the resistance to the Japanese invasion.

       "      <td>This is a bit of a niche post, but I just wanted to share a bit about a friend and I's experience backpacking near Karakol in Kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in Central Asia. Also recognize I’m going to get roasted for this, but I wish I had this information before attempting this trail and I hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. We are somewhat experienced backpackers (I did 200ish miles of the Colorado Trail last summer, we hiked portions of Shenandoah together in October 2020, he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in Kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. We based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization Destination Karakol and from the travel blog Against the Compass. We decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. In terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on AllTrails Pro and on Maps.Me. I thought about putting waypoints into my Garmin inReach mini, but decided against it. We also considered buying paper maps from Destination Karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. \\n\\nThe first trek we planned was up and over Archa Tör pass at \\~12,800 feet. The day breakdown for that hike was basically an 18 mile day one, 6 mile day two, and roughly 10-12 mile day three, ending in the resort of Jeti-Oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to Karakol. The first day started from the town of Kyzyl-Suu, about thirty minutes west of our AirBnb in Karakol. We took a shared taxi from the Southern Bus Station at the corner of Toktogul and Torgoeva Streets (a little north of the Afghan and Pushkin Parks) which cost 70 Som (\\~85 cents) each to Kyzyl-Suu. From there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both Maps.Me and AllTrails, roughly 6-7 miles from the town. It is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. Past the checkpoint was another about 5-6 miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. The scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. Around 15 miles from the town of Kyzyl-Suu on the trail (which still was basically a 4X4 road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. After this it was another 3ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on AllTrails split into two. It was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about 8,300 feet. \\n\\nAfter a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over 3000 feet of gain, only about 6 miles. At the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. The right was what it seemed like Against the Compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on AllTrails. The trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \\~100 som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic Kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. After that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a 4X4 road, before turning into single-track maybe 2 miles from where we camped the night prior. A half mile from there or so the AllTrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about 10,000 feet (from maybe 9,000-9,200 feet) over like 1-1.5 miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. We decided (wrongly) to go to the right. The trail disappeared no more than 10 minutes after the split and sent u...</td>\n",

A **Kifaru Minkeg.**\\n\\n[Minikeg – Kifaru International](https://kifaru.net/store/packs/day-packs/minikeg/)\\n\\nAfter owning many packs (Gorucks, TAD, Osprey, Mystery Ranch etc) this is my unicorn.\\n\\nFor those of you that dont know, Kifaru are a US based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the USA from top line products (Xpac, 500 denier nylon, ITW, YKK etc). Their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of 100kg+).\\n\\nSo as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.\\n\\nTheir packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. However they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the 1,000 USD mark.\\n\\nThe pack in question here however is an outlier for Kifaru - its the Minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the 22 x 14 x 9 mark. Cost is high at 370 USD, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like TAD, Mystery Ranch, Goruck etc.\\n\\nFirst - the Pics:\\n\\n[Kifaru Minikeg - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/geuu9wZ)\\n\\nFrom the manufacturer:\\n\\n**MINIKEG SPECS / FEATURES**  \\n– **Weight:** 2.85 lbs / 1.3 kg w/ Long SS, no belt  \\n– **Weight:** 3.39 lbs / 1.5 kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium WB (using roll top lid)  \\n– **Fabric:** 500d DWR coated Cordura / Xpac  \\n– **Total capacity:** 2800 ci / 45.8 L  \\n– Capacity with snow collar as lid: 2300 ci / 37.7 L  \\n– Main compartment dimensions: 11.5″ / 29cm wide x 9″ / 23cm depth x 29″ / 73.5cm height (22\" /55cms with snow collar as lid)  \\n– Opening circumference: 37.5″ / 95cm  \\n– Internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  \\n– Chamber pocket  \\n– Duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance. (Included)  \\n– 22″ Composite or aluminum stays  \\n– Dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps  \\n– Bottom compression straps  \\n– Grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack\\n\\n**Carry on capability (size)**\\n\\nI've included pictures above of the measurements. Generally they're pretty accurate; with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over 22\" (but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are 22 inches and flexible to boot) and less than 14\" wide (closer to 12\"). The only problem with size is the depth, with the main bag itself being 9\" (so fine) but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this, plus the hip-belt is pretty clunky as well.\\n\\nThat said, it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed, but I would definitely take off the hip-belt to make sure, and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out.\\n\\n**Carry on capability (weight)**\\n\\nThe pack (as I have it set up) is listed at 1.5kgs (mine weighed in at 1.7kgs stock) so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has, that's actually pretty good. Its no UL pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters, but it's no slouch either, and the comfort and durability leave UL packs dead in the water. \\n\\nI've always been of the view that I am prepared to pay an extra 0.5 - 1kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back-country, and is a dream to carry.\\n\\nHowever, note when you start adding extras (as I have) the weight increases.\\n\\nOn my pack I added the Sherman pocket (an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail, and a quick grab pocket and adds 8L + stuff...</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Trip Report: Timberline Trail, Mount Hood, Oregon** \\n\\nAugust 13th-August 16th\\n\\n3 nights, 4 days\\n\\nWeather: Extremely hot and sunny, fairly humid (but I’m coming from the East Coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the 90% range). \\n\\nResources: We brought the National Geographic Mount Hood Wilderness topographic map and a print out of the Oregonhikers.com Timberline Trail field guide. We also used the book “Around &amp;amp; About Mount Hood” by Sonia Buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. \\n\\nMost Valuable Possession (MVP): I would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. Sunscreen and a hat were also critical. I lathered up so much I barely even came away with a tan. \\n\\nLeast Valuable Possession (LVP): My raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.\\n\\nI don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the PCT, and resources I found online. They are not exact.\\n\\nDay 1: \\n\\nMy dad and I started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. We both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. On our first day the high was 103 degrees in Portland and in the mid 90’s at Timberline Lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over 100 degrees once you add in the humidity). \\n\\nWe did the trail clockwise after seeing another Reddit post about the west side having more shade. Given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. At every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. We took the Paradise Park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of Mount Hood and meadows full of wildflowers. \\n\\nAlong with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. Because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around 5.3 miles rather than the 9 we originally planned for. We found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which I enjoyed from my hammock.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[The smoky view from Paradise Park](https://preview.redd.it/hzmhh8c0lkn71.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=047695efde281ac76b0107edf0fa98402f030baf)\\n\\nDay 2: \\n\\nWe did 13.5 miles on day 2 to make up for our short first day. This was a challenging day for multiple factors. For a stretch of at least 5 miles, there were biting flies. Although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), I couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. Funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!\\n\\nWe also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in August 2020, causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. While we took the reroute on the PCT before joining back up with the Timberline Trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. The trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.\\n\\nWe had our first significant water crossing, Sandy River. Looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing I still took my time getting across. There were rocks and then a thin log to cross on. \\n\\nWe went through a section of burnt out forest from the 2011 Dollar Lake fire, which was uniquely beautiful with its white, ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens.The wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably, leading to some breathtaking vistas.

       "343   UHT Trip Report 8/7 - 8/12 2021 | 103.32 miles, 20,082ft of ascent\\n\\n[Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/gjN7nQa)\\n\\n**Initial thoughts**  \\nAs a kid I’d grown up in scouts and with a father who loved and frequented the wilderness with me alongside, and as a result I had the opportunity to take part in many week-long adventures in nature. Two of those experiences were long hikes, and though I didn’t have much part in putting those trips together, the experience I gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more. Fast forward to today where I’m 31 and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints I had as a kid, and I might as well have been starting from scratch. My hiking partner and I have been busy taking mid-length adventures for the past 5 years, though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale. After a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date, we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the Uinta Highline Trail in Utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work. We took a short period of planning, finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go.\\n\\n**Travel 8/5-8/6**\\n\\nAs a car guy, I for one was really excited because not only do I enjoy a long road trip, but this would be the first opportunity I got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure. Since purchasing my Tacoma in 2019 I’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping / adventure rig and I’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner. \\n\\nI got everything packed up, cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight. As I’m opening the back up to load his gear, he looks at me and exclaims, “Look what I got! 35L!” He’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package. Things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means I might have overthought some things. I immediately picture my 50L packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food, yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back. It’ll work itself out, perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go!\\n\\nWe took off for the 2 hour drive north to camp for the night in Flagstaff. As someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation, one concern I have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner. I was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in Flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at 7k+ feet of elevation. This should surely help, right?\\n\\nAfter a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning, we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone: snagging a breakfast burrito. This turned out to be quite the meal and while I do not have any pictures to share, take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal. Knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future, I quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go.\\n\\nThe next few hours on the way to the Eastern Terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the Navajo Nation, but began to pick up as we crossed through places like Moab, UT, Northwestern Colorado, etc. One thing that was clear though was the sky. Thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come, we hit about an hour out from the trailhead. At this point things really began to change; the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid-afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post-apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive. \\n\\nWe knew going into this that there were some fires in the area, but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next...   \n",

Red stands for the blood of the Chinese and it’s also the main color of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); often worn at weddings and festivals for good luck. The large star is for the Chinese communist party, the smaller stars represent the different groups in the country.\\n\\nAll the five stars united together to defeat [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/) in WWII. “Zeng Liansong” designed the current flag when the communist government started a new flag designing competition in 1949. He said he was inspired by the Soviet flag.\\n\\n***Sing Along***\\n\\nThe national anthem of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is called “The March of the Volunteers”. In 1935, the anthem was written by “Tian Han” and composed by “Nie Er” who both took part in the resistance to the Japanese invasion. It was written in the Vernacular –the public language- rather than the classical Chinese to reach a larger audience and encourage the Chinese people to resist the Japanese invaders.\\n\\n***Pin on the Map***\\n\\nChina lies in south-east Asia facing the Pacific Ocean, [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)shares borders with 14 countries; the summit of Mount Everest of the Himalayas is a border-line between China and Nepal.\\n\\nThe summit of Mount Everest is a boarder-line between [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and Nepal\\n\\n[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is the 4th largest country in the world and the second-biggest nation in Asia after Russia.\\n\\n[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)has over 1.500 flowing rivers; the main rivers are the Yellow River in the north and the Yangtze River in the south. Both rivers originate from the Tibetan plateau.\\n\\n***Flora and Fauna***\\n\\nThe pure water of China’s rivers has a great impact on the diversity of the Chinese wildlife with over 30,000 plant species such as [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)Fir, Yunnan Cypress, The happy tree and Bamboo.\\n\\nThe Chinese used the native plants in cooking, medical potions and offerings to God as Buddhists believe that those plants are holy. The plants provide home and food for over 4,400 animal species such as pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, Chinese pheasant and Bactrian camel.\\n\\n***Look at the History Book***\\n\\n***The First Dynasty***\\n\\nThousands of years ago, the yellow river flooded every year and destroyed crops of rice and silk. That changed when an engineer, called “Yu”, spent 13 years digging canals and waterways that redirected the floods into new fields. “Yu” saved the farmers’ lives, so he was named king and his family started the very first Dynasty of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/): The “Xia” Dynasty.\\n\\n***The First United Chinese Empire*** All the following dynasties were small, separated by rivers, and rapidly fell apart. By 221 BCE, “Qin Shi Huang” became the first emperor to unite most of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)under the rule of the “Qin” Dynasty. He set laws and had a governmental system of ministries. The Qin Empire is pronounced “CH-in”. This unified empire gave birth to today’s “CH-IN-A”.\\n\\n***The Story Behind The Wall*** Emperor “Qin” saw the Pacific Ocean and the Tibetan plateau as natural defenses. He started building a barrier against the Turkish, the Mongols and the Xiongnu in the north. He called it the long wall.\\n\\nIn the 13th century, the Mongols breached the long wall under the leadership of “Genghis Khan”. ...   \n",
       "739  This is a bit of a niche post, but I just wanted to share a bit about a friend and I's experience backpacking near Karakol in Kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in Central Asia. Also recognize I’m going to get roasted for this, but I wish I had this information before attempting this trail and I hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. We are somewhat experienced backpackers (I did 200ish miles of the Colorado Trail last summer, we hiked portions of Shenandoah together in October 2020, he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in Kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. We based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization Destination Karakol and from the travel blog Against the Compass. We decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. In terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on AllTrails Pro and on Maps.Me. I thought about putting waypoints into my Garmin inReach mini, but decided against it. We also considered buying paper maps from Destination Karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. \\n\\nThe first trek we planned was up and over Archa Tör pass at \\~12,800 feet. The day breakdown for that hike was basically an 18 mile day one, 6 mile day two, and roughly 10-12 mile day three, ending in the resort of Jeti-Oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to Karakol. The first day started from the town of Kyzyl-Suu, about thirty minutes west of our AirBnb in Karakol. We took a shared taxi from the Southern Bus Station at the corner of Toktogul and Torgoeva Streets (a little north of the Afghan and Pushkin Parks) which cost 70 Som (\\~85 cents) each to Kyzyl-Suu. From there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both Maps.Me and AllTrails, roughly 6-7 miles from the town. It is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. Past the checkpoint was another about 5-6 miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. The scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. Around 15 miles from the town of Kyzyl-Suu on the trail (which still was basically a 4X4 road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. After this it was another 3ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on AllTrails split into two. It was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about 8,300 feet. \\n\\nAfter a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over 3000 feet of gain, only about 6 miles. At the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. The right was what it seemed like Against the Compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on AllTrails. The trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \\~100 som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic Kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. After that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a 4X4 road, before turning into single-track maybe 2 miles from where we camped the night prior. A half mile from there or so the AllTrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about 10,000 feet (from maybe 9,000-9,200 feet) over like 1-1.5 miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. We decided (wrongly) to go to the right. The trail disappeared no more than 10 minutes after the split and sent u...   \n",
       "681   Hey all. Just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy, and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often. A **Kifaru Minkeg.**\\n\\n[Minikeg – Kifaru International](https://kifaru.net/store/packs/day-packs/minikeg/)\\n\\nAfter owning many packs (Gorucks, TAD, Osprey, Mystery Ranch etc) this is my unicorn.\\n\\nFor those of you that dont know, Kifaru are a US based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the USA from top line products (Xpac, 500 denier nylon, ITW, YKK etc). Their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of 100kg+).\\n\\nSo as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.\\n\\nTheir packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. However they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the 1,000 USD mark.\\n\\nThe pack in question here however is an outlier for Kifaru - its the Minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the 22 x 14 x 9 mark. Cost is high at 370 USD, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like TAD, Mystery Ranch, Goruck etc.\\n\\nFirst - the Pics:\\n\\n[Kifaru Minikeg - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/geuu9wZ)\\n\\nFrom the manufacturer:\\n\\n**MINIKEG SPECS / FEATURES**  \\n– **Weight:** 2.85 lbs / 1.3 kg w/ Long SS, no belt  \\n– **Weight:** 3.39 lbs / 1.5 kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium WB (using roll top lid)  \\n– **Fabric:** 500d DWR coated Cordura / Xpac  \\n– **Total capacity:** 2800 ci / 45.8 L  \\n– Capacity with snow collar as lid: 2300 ci / 37.7 L  \\n– Main compartment dimensions: 11.5″ / 29cm wide x 9″ / 23cm depth x 29″ / 73.5cm height (22\" /55cms with snow collar as lid)  \\n– Opening circumference: 37.5″ / 95cm  \\n– Internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  \\n– Chamber pocket  \\n– Duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance. (Included)  \\n– 22″ Composite or aluminum stays  \\n– Dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps  \\n– Bottom compression straps  \\n– Grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack\\n\\n**Carry on capability (size)**\\n\\nI've included pictures above of the measurements. Generally they're pretty accurate; with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over 22\" (but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are 22 inches and flexible to boot) and less than 14\" wide (closer to 12\"). The only problem with size is the depth, with the main bag itself being 9\" (so fine) but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this, plus the hip-belt is pretty clunky as well.\\n\\nThat said, it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed, but I would definitely take off the hip-belt to make sure, and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out.\\n\\n**Carry on capability (weight)**\\n\\nThe pack (as I have it set up) is listed at 1.5kgs (mine weighed in at 1.7kgs stock) so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has, that's actually pretty good. Its no UL pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters, but it's no slouch either, and the comfort and durability leave UL packs dead in the water. \\n\\nI've always been of the view that I am prepared to pay an extra 0.5 - 1kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back-country, and is a dream to carry.\\n\\nHowever, note when you start adding extras (as I have) the weight increases.\\n\\nOn my pack I added the Sherman pocket (an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail, and a quick grab pocket and adds 8L + stuff...   \n",
       "83   **Trip Report: Timberline Trail, Mount Hood, Oregon** \\n\\nAugust 13th-August 16th\\n\\n3 nights, 4 days\\n\\nWeather: Extremely hot and sunny, fairly humid (but I’m coming from the East Coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the 90% range). \\n\\nResources: We brought the National Geographic Mount Hood Wilderness topographic map and a print out of the Oregonhikers.com Timberline Trail field guide. We also used the book “Around &amp; About Mount Hood” by Sonia Buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. \\n\\nMost Valuable Possession (MVP): I would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. Sunscreen and a hat were also critical. I lathered up so much I barely even came away with a tan. \\n\\nLeast Valuable Possession (LVP): My raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.\\n\\nI don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the PCT, and resources I found online. They are not exact.\\n\\nDay 1: \\n\\nMy dad and I started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. We both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. On our first day the high was 103 degrees in Portland and in the mid 90’s at Timberline Lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over 100 degrees once you add in the humidity). \\n\\nWe did the trail clockwise after seeing another Reddit post about the west side having more shade. Given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. At every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. We took the Paradise Park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of Mount Hood and meadows full of wildflowers. \\n\\nAlong with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. Because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around 5.3 miles rather than the 9 we originally planned for. We found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which I enjoyed from my hammock.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[The smoky view from Paradise Park](https://preview.redd.it/hzmhh8c0lkn71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=047695efde281ac76b0107edf0fa98402f030baf)\\n\\nDay 2: \\n\\nWe did 13.5 miles on day 2 to make up for our short first day. This was a challenging day for multiple factors. For a stretch of at least 5 miles, there were biting flies. Although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), I couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. Funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!\\n\\nWe also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in August 2020, causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. While we took the reroute on the PCT before joining back up with the Timberline Trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. The trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.\\n\\nWe had our first significant water crossing, Sandy River. Looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing I still took my time getting across. There were rocks and then a thin log to cross on. \\n\\nWe went through a section of burnt out forest from the 2011 Dollar Lake fire, which was uniquely beautiful with its white, ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens.The wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably, leading to some breathtaking vistas. We had views of Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams in the distance. We also met numerous people who were trail running the whole thing in a day. Although I’m incredibly im...   \n",

       "739  this is a bit of a niche post, but i just wanted to share a bit about a friend and i's experience backpacking near karakol in kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in central asia. also recognize i’m going to get roasted for this, but i wish i had this information before attempting this trail and i hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. we are somewhat experienced backpackers (i did ish miles of the colorado trail last summer, we hiked portions of shenandoah together in october , he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. we based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization destination karakol and from the travel blog against the compass. we decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. in terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on alltrails pro and on maps.me. i thought about putting waypoints into my garmin inreach mini, but decided against it. we also considered buying paper maps from destination karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. \\n\\nthe first trek we planned was up and over archa tör pass at \\~, feet. the day breakdown for that hike was basically an  mile day one,  mile day two, and roughly - mile day three, ending in the resort of jeti-oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to karakol. the first day started from the town of kyzyl-suu, about thirty minutes west of our airbnb in karakol. we took a shared taxi from the southern bus station at the corner of toktogul and torgoeva streets (a little north of the afghan and pushkin parks) which cost  som (\\~ cents) each to kyzyl-suu. from there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both maps.me and alltrails, roughly - miles from the town. it is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. past the checkpoint was another about - miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. the scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. around  miles from the town of kyzyl-suu on the trail (which still was basically a x road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. after this it was another ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on alltrails split into two. it was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about , feet. \\n\\nafter a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over  feet of gain, only about  miles. at the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. the right was what it seemed like against the compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on alltrails. the trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \\~ som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. after that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a x road, before turning into single-track maybe  miles from where we camped the night prior. a half mile from there or so the alltrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about , feet (from maybe ,-, feet) over like -. miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. we decided (wrongly) to go to the right. the trail disappeared no more than  minutes after the split and sent us basically crawling up the banks of a tributary and then climbin...   \n",
       "681  hey all. just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy, and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often. a **kifaru minkeg.**\\n\\n[minikeg – kifaru international](\\n\\nafter owning many packs (gorucks, tad, osprey, mystery ranch etc) this is my unicorn.\\n\\nfor those of you that dont know, kifaru are a us based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the usa from top line products (xpac,  denier nylon, itw, ykk etc). their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of kg+).\\n\\nso as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.\\n\\ntheir packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. however they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the , usd mark.\\n\\nthe pack in question here however is an outlier for kifaru - its the minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the  x  x  mark. cost is high at  usd, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like tad, mystery ranch, goruck etc.\\n\\nfirst - the pics:\\n\\n[kifaru minikeg - imgur](\\n\\nfrom the manufacturer:\\n\\n**minikeg specs / features**  \\n– **weight:** . lbs / . kg w/ long ss, no belt  \\n– **weight:** . lbs / . kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium wb (using roll top lid)  \\n– **fabric:** d dwr coated cordura / xpac  \\n– **total capacity:**  ci / . l  \\n– capacity with snow collar as lid:  ci / . l  \\n– main compartment dimensions: .″ / cm wide x ″ / cm depth x ″ / .cm height (\" /cms with snow collar as lid)  \\n– opening circumference: .″ / cm  \\n– internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  \\n– chamber pocket  \\n– duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance. (included)  \\n– ″ composite or aluminum stays  \\n– dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps  \\n– bottom compression straps  \\n– grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack\\n\\n**carry on capability (size)**\\n\\ni've included pictures above of the measurements. generally they're pretty accurate; with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over \" (but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are  inches and flexible to boot) and less than \" wide (closer to \"). the only problem with size is the depth, with the main bag itself being \" (so fine) but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this, plus the hip-belt is pretty clunky as well.\\n\\nthat said, it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed, but i would definitely take off the hip-belt to make sure, and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out.\\n\\n**carry on capability (weight)**\\n\\nthe pack (as i have it set up) is listed at .kgs (mine weighed in at .kgs stock) so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has, that's actually pretty good. its no ul pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters, but it's no slouch either, and the comfort and durability leave ul packs dead in the water. \\n\\ni've always been of the view that i am prepared to pay an extra . - kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back-country, and is a dream to carry.\\n\\nhowever, note when you start adding extras (as i have) the weight increases.\\n\\non my pack i added the sherman pocket (an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail, and a quick grab pocket and adds l + stuff it capacity to the overall bag. i also added  belt pouches (a small, a mini and a roll up dump pouch from helikon tex to function as a water bottle holder on the be...   \n",
       "83   **trip report: timberline trail, mount hood, oregon** \\n\\naugust th-august th\\n\\n nights,  days\\n\\nweather: extremely hot and sunny, fairly humid (but i’m coming from the east coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the % range). \\n\\nresources: we brought the national geographic mount hood wilderness topographic map and a print out of the oregonhikers.com timberline trail field guide. we also used the book “around  about mount hood” by sonia buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. \\n\\nmost valuable possession (mvp): i would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. sunscreen and a hat were also critical. i lathered up so much i barely even came away with a tan. \\n\\nleast valuable possession (lvp): my raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.\\n\\ni don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the pct, and resources i found online. they are not exact.\\n\\nday : \\n\\nmy dad and i started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. we both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. on our first day the high was  degrees in portland and in the mid ’s at timberline lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over  degrees once you add in the humidity). \\n\\nwe did the trail clockwise after seeing another reddit post about the west side having more shade. given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. at every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. we took the paradise park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of mount hood and meadows full of wildflowers. \\n\\nalong with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around . miles rather than the  we originally planned for. we found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which i enjoyed from my hammock.\\n\\n\\n\\n[the smoky view from paradise park](\\n\\nday : \\n\\nwe did . miles on day  to make up for our short first day. this was a challenging day for multiple factors. for a stretch of at least  miles, there were biting flies. although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), i couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!\\n\\nwe also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in august , causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. while we took the reroute on the pct before joining back up with the timberline trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. the trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.\\n\\nwe had our first significant water crossing, sandy river. looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing i still took my time getting across. there were rocks and then a thin log to cross on. \\n\\nwe went through a section of burnt out forest from the  dollar lake fire, which was uniquely beautiful with its white, ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens.the wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably, leading to some breathtaking vistas. we had views of mount st. helens and mount adams in the distance. we also met numerous people who were trail running the whole thing in a day. although i’m incredibly impressed with their endurance, that sounds miserable to me!\\n\\nwe took the eden park detour at the recommendation of our guidebook (she specifically describes it as “one of the jewel...   \n",

       "343  uht trip report miles ft of ascent initial thoughts as a kid i’d grown up in scouts and with a father who loved and frequented the wilderness with me alongside and as a result i had the opportunity to take part in many week long adventures in nature two of those experiences were long hikes and though i didn’t have much part in putting those trips together the experience i gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more fast forward to today where i’m and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints i had as a kid and i might as well have been starting from scratch my hiking partner and i have been busy taking mid length adventures for the past years though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale after a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the uinta highline trail in utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work we took a short period of planning finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go travel as a car guy i for one was really excited because not only do i enjoy a long road trip but this would be the first opportunity i got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure since purchasing my tacoma in i’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping adventure rig and i’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner i got everything packed up cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight as i’m opening the back up to load his gear he looks at me and exclaims look what i got l he’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means i might have overthought some things i immediately picture my l packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back it’ll work itself out perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go we took off for the hour drive north to camp for the night in flagstaff as someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation one concern i have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner i was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at k feet of elevation this should surely help right after a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone snagging a breakfast burrito this turned out to be quite the meal and while i do not have any pictures to share take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future i quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go the next few hours on the way to the eastern terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the navajo nation but began to pick up as we crossed through places like moab ut northwestern colorado etc one thing that was clear though was the sky thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come we hit about an hour out from the trailhead at this point things really began to change the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive we knew going into this that there were some fires in the area but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next week or so the scene at the trailhead was nothing short of sobering as the sun began to fade and i scrambled to finish packing my bag sobering in the sense that we were about to head into a smoke fille...   \n",

       "739  this is a bit of a niche post but i just wanted to share a bit about a friend and i's experience backpacking near karakol in kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in central asia also recognize i’m going to get roasted for this but i wish i had this information before attempting this trail and i hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area we are somewhat experienced backpackers i did ish miles of the colorado trail last summer we hiked portions of shenandoah together in october he’s done some other longer hikes etc and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad we based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization destination karakol and from the travel blog against the compass we decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online both two nights and three days in terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on alltrails pro and on maps me i thought about putting waypoints into my garmin inreach mini but decided against it we also considered buying paper maps from destination karakol but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have the first trek we planned was up and over archa tör pass at feet the day breakdown for that hike was basically an mile day one mile day two and roughly mile day three ending in the resort of jeti oguz where we would catch a cheap taxi back to karakol the first day started from the town of kyzyl suu about thirty minutes west of our airbnb in karakol we took a shared taxi from the southern bus station at the corner of toktogul and torgoeva streets a little north of the afghan and pushkin parks which cost som cents each to kyzyl suu from there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both maps me and alltrails roughly miles from the town it is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint but we chose to hoof it past the checkpoint was another about miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large unfordable imo river the scenery was fine nothing spectacular yet choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option around miles from the town of kyzyl suu on the trail which still was basically a x road we hit a hot springs establishment resort type thing after this it was another ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on alltrails split into two it was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about feet after a nice night there we started on day two which was short but with over feet of gain only about miles at the start there were two options for the trail to stay on the right of the river going against the current or to go to the left the right was what it seemed like against the compass recommended but we decided to go to the left which was on alltrails the trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy boggy but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car after that the trail continued upwards mostly seeming like a x road before turning into single track maybe miles from where we camped the night prior a half mile from there or so the alltrails instructions split to the left had more consistent gain up to about feet from maybe feet over like miles the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail we decided wrongly to go to the right the trail disappeared no more than minutes after the split and sent us basically crawling up the banks of a tributary and then climbing up to a flatter section and fighting through some incredibly dense ish foot tall juvenile juniper forest this was a...   \n",
       "681  hey all just wanted to share my thoughts on my new pride and joy and a pack you dont see around these parts all that often a kifaru minkeg minikeg kifaru international after owning many packs gorucks tad osprey mystery ranch etc this is my unicorn for those of you that dont know kifaru are a us based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the usa from top line products xpac denier nylon itw ykk etc their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus with durability and heavy load hauling we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of kg so as a general rule not the sort of thing we go for around these parts their packs are rightly famous for durability load hauling ability comfort and quality however they are also equally infamous for their high cost with an external frame pack extras combo looking to push you close to the usd mark the pack in question here however is an outlier for kifaru its the minikeg a relatively lightweight and internal framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the x x mark cost is high at usd but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs and on par with peers like tad mystery ranch goruck etc first the pics kifaru minikeg imgur from the manufacturer minikeg specs features weight lbs kg w long ss no belt weight lbs kg w long shoulder straps and medium wb using roll top lid fabric d dwr coated cordura xpac total capacity ci l capacity with snow collar as lid ci l main compartment dimensions cm wide x cm depth x cm height cms with snow collar as lid opening circumference cm internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports chamber pocket duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance included composite or aluminum stays dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps bottom compression straps grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack carry on capability size i've included pictures above of the measurements generally they're pretty accurate with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are inches and flexible to boot and less than wide closer to the only problem with size is the depth with the main bag itself being so fine but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this plus the hip belt is pretty clunky as well that said it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed but i would definitely take off the hip belt to make sure and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out carry on capability weight the pack as i have it set up is listed at kgs mine weighed in at kgs stock so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has that's actually pretty good its no ul pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters but it's no slouch either and the comfort and durability leave ul packs dead in the water i've always been of the view that i am prepared to pay an extra kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back country and is a dream to carry however note when you start adding extras as i have the weight increases on my pack i added the sherman pocket an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail and a quick grab pocket and adds l stuff it capacity to the overall bag i also added belt pouches a small a mini and a roll up dump pouch from helikon tex to function as a water bottle holder on the belt a helikon tex removable framesheet containing a sea to summit tablet sleeve and some shock cord for a bungee system plus an itw nexus carabiner and webbing keepers and the spare webbing straps you need to carry if you want to run this thing without a hip belt to look a little less conspicuous boarding aircraft for example this all pushed the tota...   \n",
       "83   trip report timberline trail mount hood oregon august th august th nights days weather extremely hot and sunny fairly humid but i’m coming from the east coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the range resources we brought the national geographic mount hood wilderness topographic map and a print out of the oregonhikers com timberline trail field guide we also used the book around about mount hood by sonia buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight most valuable possession mvp i would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand sunscreen and a hat were also critical i lathered up so much i barely even came away with a tan least valuable possession lvp my raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag i don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map the reroute on the pct and resources i found online they are not exact day my dad and i started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory we both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures on our first day the high was degrees in portland and in the mid ’s at timberline lodge in the afternoon with the real feel being over degrees once you add in the humidity we did the trail clockwise after seeing another reddit post about the west side having more shade given the incredibly hot weather it was a no brainer at every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool we took the paradise park detour which was well worth it with gorgeous views of mount hood and meadows full of wildflowers along with being hot it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires because of these two things we cut our first day short around miles rather than the we originally planned for we found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which i enjoyed from my hammock the smoky view from paradise park day we did miles on day to make up for our short first day this was a challenging day for multiple factors for a stretch of at least miles there were biting flies although the hiking was frequently uphill blessedly shaded for many portions i couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body including my face funnily they didn’t bother my dad at all only me lucky him we also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in august causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable while we took the reroute on the pct before joining back up with the timberline trail we still encountered fallen trees across the trail slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them the trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route we had our first significant water crossing sandy river looking back it was a breeze but since it was my first legit river crossing i still took my time getting across there were rocks and then a thin log to cross on we went through a section of burnt out forest from the dollar lake fire which was uniquely beautiful with its white ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens the wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably leading to some breathtaking vistas we had views of mount st helens and mount adams in the distance we also met numerous people who were trail running the whole thing in a day although i’m incredibly impressed with their endurance that sounds miserable to me we took the eden park detour at the recommendation of our guidebook she specifically describes it as one of the jewels of the timberline trail but personally i wouldn’t suggest it according to the nat geo map it adds an extra miles and while pretty i didn’t find it nearly as striking as parad...   \n",

       "343  uht trip report mile ft of ascent initial thought a a kid i’d grown up in scout and with a father who loved and frequented the wilderness with me alongside and a a result i had the opportunity to take part in many week long adventure in nature two of those experience were long hike and though i didn’t have much part in putting those trip together the experience i gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more fast forward to today where i’m and do not have the endless energy and rubber joint i had a a kid and i might a well have been starting from scratch my hiking partner and i have been busy taking mid length adventure for the past year though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale after a long time throwing idea around and making plan only to have them change at a later date we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the uinta highline trail in utah mere week before we were both scheduled to take our vacation from work we took a short period of planning finalized our gear list and we were finally ready to go travel a a car guy i for one wa really excited because not only do i enjoy a long road trip but this would be the first opportunity i got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure since purchasing my tacoma in i’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping adventure rig and i’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner i got everything packed up cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight a i’m opening the back up to load his gear he look at me and exclaims look what i got l he’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package thing got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choice mean i might have overthought some thing i immediately picture my l packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back it’ll work itself out perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go we took off for the hour drive north to camp for the night in flagstaff a someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation one concern i have had for a trip like we were about to embark on wa my ability to acclimate to the higher elevation in a timely manner i wa thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in flagstaff the very first day he wa in town because that meant one extra day at k foot of elevation this should surely help right after a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone snagging a breakfast burrito this turned out to be quite the meal and while i do not have any picture to share take my word that this wa a knife and fork type of ordeal knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future i quickly scarfed it down and wa ready to go the next few hour on the way to the eastern terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast land of the navajo nation but began to pick up a we crossed through place like moab ut northwestern colorado etc one thing that wa clear though wa the sky thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that wa to come we hit about an hour out from the trailhead at this point thing really began to change the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post apocalyptic scene a we completed our drive we knew going into this that there were some fire in the area but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next week or so the scene at the trailhead wa nothing short of sobering a the sun began to fade and i scrambled to finish packing my bag sobering in the sense that we were about to head into a smoke filled environment for an unforeseen number of day b...   \n",

       "739  this is a bit of a niche post but i just wanted to share a bit about a friend and i's experience backpacking near karakol in kyrgyzstan and provide more context for anybody else headed out to trek in central asia also recognize i’m going to get roasted for this but i wish i had this information before attempting this trail and i hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area we are somewhat experienced backpacker i did ish mile of the colorado trail last summer we hiked portion of shenandoah together in october he’s done some other longer hike etc and had done a lot of online prep work for our hike in kyrgyzstan a this would be both of our first time trekking abroad we based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization destination karakol and from the travel blog against the compass we decided we would do two hike based on everything we read online both two night and three day in term of map we had the trail map and location available both on alltrails pro and on map me i thought about putting waypoints into my garmin inreach mini but decided against it we also considered buying paper map from destination karakol but decided it wa not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have the first trek we planned wa up and over archa tör pas at foot the day breakdown for that hike wa basically an mile day one mile day two and roughly mile day three ending in the resort of jeti oguz where we would catch a cheap taxi back to karakol the first day started from the town of kyzyl suu about thirty minute west of our airbnb in karakol we took a shared taxi from the southern bus station at the corner of toktogul and torgoeva street a little north of the afghan and pushkin park which cost som cent each to kyzyl suu from there the trail instruction were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that wa marked on both map me and alltrails roughly mile from the town it is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint but we chose to hoof it past the checkpoint wa another about mile to the crossing of a number of rickety bridge over a relatively large unfordable imo river the scenery wa fine nothing spectacular yet choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option around mile from the town of kyzyl suu on the trail which still wa basically a x road we hit a hot spring establishment resort type thing after this it wa another ish mile on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night which wa when the river valley really opened up and the trail on alltrails split into two it wa in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about foot after a nice night there we started on day two which wa short but with over foot of gain only about mile at the start there were two option for the trail to stay on the right of the river going against the current or to go to the left the right wa what it seemed like against the compass recommended but we decided to go to the left which wa on alltrails the trail more or le disappeared pretty quickly and it wa a little swampy boggy but all in all it wa a fine choice and saved u som each bc on the other side of the river hiker pay nomadic kyrgyz kid to pull them across on a cable car after that the trail continued upwards mostly seeming like a x road before turning into single track maybe mile from where we camped the night prior a half mile from there or so the alltrails instruction split to the left had more consistent gain up to about foot from maybe foot over like mile the right took u back down to the river before shooting u up and rejoining the other trail we decided wrongly to go to the right the trail disappeared no more than minute after the split and sent u basically crawling up the bank of a tributary and then climbing up to a flatter section and fighting through some incredibly dense ish foot tall juvenile juniper forest this wa all on the alltrails trail according to our phone location tr...   \n",

To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I've created this Megathread.**\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor questions on COVID Vaccine Passports please use the COVID Megathread, 1st post in /r/travel.\\n\\n___\\n\\nTHE BEST ADVICE IS APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. DO NOT CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY. \\n\\n\\n___\\n\\n**[The Spring/Summer 2021 Passport Megathread can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/nhe74a/passport_questions_issues_megathread_summer_2021/).**\\n___\\n\\n#American Passport Information \\n\\n## How to Apply\\n\\n[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).\\n\\nThere will be a form to fill out.

This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).\\n\\n[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).\\n\\nNOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. \\n\\n\\n##Processing Times Within the US\\nAs of September 2021, \\n\\n[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).\\n\\nNormal processing is around 18 weeks.\\n\\nExpedited processing is around 12 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)\\n\\nLife or Death/ Urgent/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.\\n\\nNOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.\\n\\nNOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel \"to the day\" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.\\n\\nNOTE: It can take up to 4 weeks before your status changes to \"In Process\".\\n\\n**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than 12 weeks BUT NOT ALL.

       "      <td>15 Day Italian Honeymoon in November: Tuscany - Cinque Terre - Amalfi Coast.... questions below! Any and all input is greatly appreciated :)</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hello all,\\n\\nWe got married 1 month before Covid hit in the U.S. and have been delaying our Honeymoon until now. We were originally going in the Spring but just found out that my wife is pregnant so we decided to go asap (November being the absolute soonest due to having to wait for a Visa appointment). I know November is not the optimal time to go but it's a now or never type situation.\\n\\n**Some background:** We have previously done the traditional Rome, Florence, and Venice trip so this time around, we are trying to see entirely new places. We want to spend more time in less places. Ideally, we would love to stay in quaint towns surrounded by beautiful landscapes that are not as crowded with tourists. I know that a lot of Italy's \"hidden gems\" are not so hidden anymore so this might prove to be challenging. With that being said, it's my understanding that November is one of the least touristy months which should help!\\n\\nOur priority is charming towns/small cities, surrounded by nature, with plenty of good local food. We like to be active (walking/hiking) so while I love the idea of relaxing in front of a beach all day long, that gets old quick for us. Lastly, we are not big on art history/museums so we don't plan on going out of our way to fit that in. Budget-wise, this is our last shebang before having a baby so we want to treat ourselves.\\n\\nWe definitely want to do Tuscany and rent a car to do day trips to different places in the region. The only other place that we want to go to is the Amalfi Coast and/or Cinque Terre. I know these two are inevitably going to be super touristy but as long as most of the trip is not, we'll be happy. We fly into Florence and fly out of Rome.\\n\\nI have included some specific questions below. Outside of that, any general input, feedback, or advice would be greaattllyy appreciated! I live in Utah so should you ever plan a trip out here, I would be more than happy to reciprocate :)\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n*Tuscany*\\n\\n\\- I hear that the weather in November is cold and rainy. I still want to go and don't mind dealing with unfavorable weather in exchange for less crowds. Is it that bad that I should minimize my days in Tuscany?\\n\\n\\- Since we want to spend more time in less places, what are good cities/towns that we can stay in as a home base in Tuscany where we can do day trips out of? Two places that caught my attention were San Quirico d'Orcia and Lucca ( 2-3 days in each) since they are on opposite ends of Tuscany. Thoughts?\\n\\n\\- If I spend 5-7 days in the Tuscany region, what are some places (vineyards, restaurants, cafes, etc) should consider? For food and drink, I don't mind going out of my way for an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Cinque Terre vs. Amalfi Coast*\\n\\n\\- Time-wise, I think we have the ability to do both without spreading ourselves too thin. However, from the pictures, Cinque Terre and Amalfi appear to have a similar vibe/aesthetic. Are they different enough to justify doing both? If not, which one would you suggest? (If I only do one, I am leaning towards Amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in November but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- I will have a car in Tuscany so I would consider driving up the coast to Cinque Terre. Is this something you would recommend? Or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to Cinque Terre? If not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the Lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- Due to the time of the year, I have been told that Southern Italy has much better weather. I am open to trimming the Tuscany portion to explore more of Southern Italy. If so, what are some areas near Amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy?

       "      <td>hello all,\\n\\nwe got married  month before covid hit in the u.s. and have been delaying our honeymoon until now. we were originally going in the spring but just found out that my wife is pregnant so we decided to go asap (november being the absolute soonest due to having to wait for a visa appointment). i know november is not the optimal time to go but it's a now or never type situation.\\n\\n**some background:** we have previously done the traditional rome, florence, and venice trip so this time around, we are trying to see entirely new places. we want to spend more time in less places. ideally, we would love to stay in quaint towns surrounded by beautiful landscapes that are not as crowded with tourists. i know that a lot of italy's \"hidden gems\" are not so hidden anymore so this might prove to be challenging. with that being said, it's my understanding that november is one of the least touristy months which should help!\\n\\nour priority is charming towns/small cities, surrounded by nature, with plenty of good local food. we like to be active (walking/hiking) so while i love the idea of relaxing in front of a beach all day long, that gets old quick for us. lastly, we are not big on art history/museums so we don't plan on going out of our way to fit that in. budget-wise, this is our last shebang before having a baby so we want to treat ourselves.\\n\\nwe definitely want to do tuscany and rent a car to do day trips to different places in the region. the only other place that we want to go to is the amalfi coast and/or cinque terre. i know these two are inevitably going to be super touristy but as long as most of the trip is not, we'll be happy. we fly into florence and fly out of rome.\\n\\ni have included some specific questions below. outside of that, any general input, feedback, or advice would be greaattllyy appreciated! i live in utah so should you ever plan a trip out here, i would be more than happy to reciprocate :)\\n\\n\\n\\n**questions:**\\n\\n*tuscany*\\n\\n\\- i hear that the weather in november is cold and rainy. i still want to go and don't mind dealing with unfavorable weather in exchange for less crowds. is it that bad that i should minimize my days in tuscany?\\n\\n\\- since we want to spend more time in less places, what are good cities/towns that we can stay in as a home base in tuscany where we can do day trips out of? two places that caught my attention were san quirico d'orcia and lucca ( - days in each) since they are on opposite ends of tuscany. thoughts?\\n\\n\\- if i spend - days in the tuscany region, what are some places (vineyards, restaurants, cafes, etc) should consider? for food and drink, i don't mind going out of my way for an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n*cinque terre vs. amalfi coast*\\n\\n\\- time-wise, i think we have the ability to do both without spreading ourselves too thin. however, from the pictures, cinque terre and amalfi appear to have a similar vibe/aesthetic. are they different enough to justify doing both? if not, which one would you suggest? (if i only do one, i am leaning towards amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in november but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- i will have a car in tuscany so i would consider driving up the coast to cinque terre. is this something you would recommend? or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to cinque terre? if not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- due to the time of the year, i have been told that southern italy has much better weather. i am open to trimming the tuscany portion to explore more of southern italy. if so, what are some areas near amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?\\n\\nthanks in advance!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yesterday I had the pleasure of spending 20 hours in 7 different airports. Here's my horror story:\\n\\nMy original itinerary was to fly from Lubbock, TX to Richmond, VA through Dallas and Atlanta on Saturday. However, after spending 3 hours in the Lubbock airport Saturday it became clear that my flights to and from Dallas would be delayed due to weather and I'd be stuck in Atlanta overnight. Instead I opted to get rebooked to the next day and spend another night in Lubbock with my girlfriend.\\n\\nMy rebooked itinerary was this: Lubbock to Dallas to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Super fun, right? 6AM to 1130PM, great. \\n\\nI show up to the airport bright and early to check my bag to Richmond, where the ticket counter agent tells me that it's too long away of an arrival time to check my bag to Richmond, so I'll need to get my bag from the baggage claim in Dallas then recheck it at the ticket counter there. Ok fine, I have 5 hours I'll be ok.\\n\\nI get to Dallas, get my bag, and go to recheck it to Richmond. I tell the agent about the crappy itinerary I have, and he actually found me a flight that would let me stay on the same plane and get me home by 6PM: Dallas to San Antonio to Chicago to Richmond. \"Awesome!\" I think, \"this is way better!\" I rebook my flights, grab a coffee, and head to San Antonio.\\n\\nIn San Antonio, where I should have been comfortably stretching waiting for the plane to board new passengers, I'm told that the plane has been switched and I need to go to a new gate. \"Weird, but fine, let me talk to a gate agent though\". Turns out there's been a mechanical issue and the new plane will be going to Chicago but not Richmond. At first she says there's no way to make it there that night and they'd put me in a hotel in Chicago. But wait! One way I'd make it there that night is if I get on a flight from San Antonio to Houston, then the last open spot on a flight from Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Of course I wasn't surprised there'd be an open spot on the flight, since it was literally the same spot I gave up this morning that got me stuck in San Antonio in the first place.\\n\\nI get on my flight from San Antonio to Houston. It's delayed, but not that much and I make it just in time to make my connection. I board in Houston and proceed to sit on the plane for an hour, then the gate for another hour, as a massive thunderstorm continues to generate directly over the airport.\\n\\nWe leave 2 and a half hours late. The leg from Houston to Memphis was completely full, the leg from Memphis to Atlanta was nearly empty, and the final leg from Atlanta to Richmond was nearly full. We land at about 1:30AM and I stumble to the baggage claim. I'll finally be home!\\n\\nMy bag isn't there. When they switched everything around in San Antonio the gate agent had no way of giving me actually confirmation that my bag was switched, just a promise that they would take care of it. I trusted them, but I guess somewhere along the line my bag got lost in the shuffle.\\n\\nAll in all, it was 20 hours of travel through 7 different airports: Lubbock to Dallas to San Antonio to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. 13 of those hours were spent in Texas, trying to navigate weather and mechanical issues. My checked bag is nowhere to be found. \\n\\nTl;dr: Try not to fly in Texas in the Summer after 1PM, you **WILL** get delayed by weather. Also, always bring snacks and an extra pair of clothes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi everyone. I’m planning a trip through the USA for me and my girlfriend. We don’t have an exact date yet, but we’d like to go in the summer period. \\n\\nI have planned the route out according to our mutual interests but I was wondering if someone had some advice on certain points or maybe ideas for places we shouldn’t miss. We’re the kind of travellers that enjoy passing through as much as hotspots as possible. We did several trips already with a fully loaded schedule, but always well planned so that we get to see everything in a short amount of time. And yes, people have called us crazy more then once haha.  So in general, this is our itinerary:\\n\\nDay 1: Amsterdam - Seattle (by plane). We want to visit the Hoh Rain Forest and the Boeing Museum.\\nDay 4: Seattle - Portland (with rental car all the way to Las Vegas). We thought that the Multnomah Falls and the Japanese Gardens would be cool to visit. \\nDay 7: Portland - San Francisco where we would want to check out downtown, the Golden Gate and Alcatraz\\nDay 10: San Francisco - Los Angeles where we’d have a full beach day and visits to Hollywood (and the sign ofc haha) and Beverly Hills\\nDay 14: Los Angeles - Las Vegas. Here we’d like to visit the strip ofcourse. But as we’re both not the gambling type of persons we wouldn’t want to stay for more than a night or two. \\nDay 16: Las Vegas - Santa Fe. In LV, we’d like to rent a RV and make a pitstop to slee in Santa Fe. We’d like to pass the Hoover Dam and visit The Grand Canyon.\\nDay 17: Santa Fe - Oklahoma City. This would be a driving day and the drop off for the RV. Maybe someone knows cool spots somewhere in between where we could stay or visit? Or maybe cool things in Oklahoma?\\nDay 18: Oklahoma City - St Louis (by plane). As we’re both Bosnians, we cant visit the USA without visiting St. Louis lol.\\nDay 19: St. Louis - Chicago (by rental car all the way to Washington DC). If someone has tips on nice scenic routes or hotspots on the road, please share! In Chicago we’d like to do a River cruise, check the Magnificent Mile, the famous Willis Tower and the Skydeck. \\nDay 22: Chicago - DuBois. This would be a driving day where we’d make a pitstop in DuBois.\\nDay 23: DuBois - New York City: \\tI’m a huge fan of the Big Apple. So I’d like to go all out here. This means Greenwich Village, The Vessel, North 5th Pier, Rockefeller, Central Park ofcourse and the Empire State, Ground Zero, Grand Central Station, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, SoHo, the Waldorf Astoria (only from the outside lol)\\nDay 29: New York City - Washington DC. Hellooo Joe Biden! We’d go visit the White House, The Capitol, Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian. \\nDay 32: Washington DC - New Orleans (by plane). We’d go visit the French Quarter, Garden District, Oak Alley and we were recommended to do the Ghost Tour.\\nDay 35: New Orleans - Orlando (with rental car all the way to Miami). Orlando is all about Universal Studios and Disney World for us haha. We’d stay in the Portofino one as we think he has the best scenery!\\nDay 39: Orlando- Miami. Our trio would end in Miami. I don’t know what are cool places to visit but we’d stay maybe 3-4 days and enjoy sunny days on Miami Beach. \\n\\nSo that’s it in a nutshell. If someone has tips, let me know!

       "1590  Despite increasing vaccination rates, with concerns about the delta variant, the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation continues to have a major effect on travel, with many now looking to understand if, when, or how their travels might be feasible. Accordingly, /r/travel is continuing its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates.\\n\\nIn the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**\\n\\n## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?\\n\\nA list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm). Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).\\n\\nYou may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**\\n\\n## ...in the US?\\n\\nAt the time of writing, *foreign nationals (regardless of vaccination status)* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in *or transited* via Brazil, China, India, Iran, Ireland, the Schengen Area, South Africa, or the UK in the preceding 14 days.

       "1067  **For the last few months we've been getting multiple posts a day on American Passport Questions. To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I've created this Megathread.**\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor questions on COVID Vaccine Passports please use the COVID Megathread, 1st post in /r/travel.\\n\\n___\\n\\nTHE BEST ADVICE IS APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. DO NOT CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY. \\n\\n\\n___\\n\\n**[The Spring/Summer 2021 Passport Megathread can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/nhe74a/passport_questions_issues_megathread_summer_2021/).**\\n___\\n\\n#American Passport Information \\n\\n## How to Apply\\n\\n[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).\\n\\nThere will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents &amp; IDs you'll need, etc.\\n\\n##Where to Apply\\n\\n[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).\\n\\n[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).\\n\\nNOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. \\n\\n\\n##Processing Times Within the US\\nAs of September 2021, \\n\\n[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).\\n\\nNormal processing is around 18 weeks.\\n\\nExpedited processing is around 12 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)\\n\\nLife or Death/ Urgent/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.\\n\\nNOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.\\n\\nNOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel \"to the day\" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.\\n\\nNOTE: It can take up to 4 weeks before your status changes to \"In Process\".\\n\\n**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than 12 weeks BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**\\n___\\n\\n#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US\\n\\n### What is the status of my application?\\n\\nCheck here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/\\n\\n### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?\\n\\nNo. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 4-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. \\n\\nOnce they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.\\n\\n### Can I get a same day passport.\\n\\nNot likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.\\n\\n### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I ...   \n",
       "1843                                                                                                              Hello all,\\n\\nWe got married 1 month before Covid hit in the U.S. and have been delaying our Honeymoon until now. We were originally going in the Spring but just found out that my wife is pregnant so we decided to go asap (November being the absolute soonest due to having to wait for a Visa appointment). I know November is not the optimal time to go but it's a now or never type situation.\\n\\n**Some background:** We have previously done the traditional Rome, Florence, and Venice trip so this time around, we are trying to see entirely new places. We want to spend more time in less places. Ideally, we would love to stay in quaint towns surrounded by beautiful landscapes that are not as crowded with tourists. I know that a lot of Italy's \"hidden gems\" are not so hidden anymore so this might prove to be challenging. With that being said, it's my understanding that November is one of the least touristy months which should help!\\n\\nOur priority is charming towns/small cities, surrounded by nature, with plenty of good local food. We like to be active (walking/hiking) so while I love the idea of relaxing in front of a beach all day long, that gets old quick for us. Lastly, we are not big on art history/museums so we don't plan on going out of our way to fit that in. Budget-wise, this is our last shebang before having a baby so we want to treat ourselves.\\n\\nWe definitely want to do Tuscany and rent a car to do day trips to different places in the region. The only other place that we want to go to is the Amalfi Coast and/or Cinque Terre. I know these two are inevitably going to be super touristy but as long as most of the trip is not, we'll be happy. We fly into Florence and fly out of Rome.\\n\\nI have included some specific questions below. Outside of that, any general input, feedback, or advice would be greaattllyy appreciated! I live in Utah so should you ever plan a trip out here, I would be more than happy to reciprocate :)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n*Tuscany*\\n\\n\\- I hear that the weather in November is cold and rainy. I still want to go and don't mind dealing with unfavorable weather in exchange for less crowds. Is it that bad that I should minimize my days in Tuscany?\\n\\n\\- Since we want to spend more time in less places, what are good cities/towns that we can stay in as a home base in Tuscany where we can do day trips out of? Two places that caught my attention were San Quirico d'Orcia and Lucca ( 2-3 days in each) since they are on opposite ends of Tuscany. Thoughts?\\n\\n\\- If I spend 5-7 days in the Tuscany region, what are some places (vineyards, restaurants, cafes, etc) should consider? For food and drink, I don't mind going out of my way for an unforgettable experience.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Cinque Terre vs. Amalfi Coast*\\n\\n\\- Time-wise, I think we have the ability to do both without spreading ourselves too thin. However, from the pictures, Cinque Terre and Amalfi appear to have a similar vibe/aesthetic. Are they different enough to justify doing both? If not, which one would you suggest? (If I only do one, I am leaning towards Amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in November but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- I will have a car in Tuscany so I would consider driving up the coast to Cinque Terre. Is this something you would recommend? Or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to Cinque Terre? If not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the Lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- Due to the time of the year, I have been told that Southern Italy has much better weather. I am open to trimming the Tuscany portion to explore more of Southern Italy. If so, what are some areas near Amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? Sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?\\n\\nThanks in advance!   \n",

Here's my horror story:\\n\\nMy original itinerary was to fly from Lubbock, TX to Richmond, VA through Dallas and Atlanta on Saturday. However, after spending 3 hours in the Lubbock airport Saturday it became clear that my flights to and from Dallas would be delayed due to weather and I'd be stuck in Atlanta overnight. Instead I opted to get rebooked to the next day and spend another night in Lubbock with my girlfriend.\\n\\nMy rebooked itinerary was this: Lubbock to Dallas to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Super fun, right? 6AM to 1130PM, great. \\n\\nI show up to the airport bright and early to check my bag to Richmond, where the ticket counter agent tells me that it's too long away of an arrival time to check my bag to Richmond, so I'll need to get my bag from the baggage claim in Dallas then recheck it at the ticket counter there. Ok fine, I have 5 hours I'll be ok.\\n\\nI get to Dallas, get my bag, and go to recheck it to Richmond. I tell the agent about the crappy itinerary I have, and he actually found me a flight that would let me stay on the same plane and get me home by 6PM: Dallas to San Antonio to Chicago to Richmond. \"Awesome!\" I think, \"this is way better!\" I rebook my flights, grab a coffee, and head to San Antonio.\\n\\nIn San Antonio, where I should have been comfortably stretching waiting for the plane to board new passengers, I'm told that the plane has been switched and I need to go to a new gate. \"Weird, but fine, let me talk to a gate agent though\". Turns out there's been a mechanical issue and the new plane will be going to Chicago but not Richmond. At first she says there's no way to make it there that night and they'd put me in a hotel in Chicago. But wait! One way I'd make it there that night is if I get on a flight from San Antonio to Houston, then the last open spot on a flight from Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Of course I wasn't surprised there'd be an open spot on the flight, since it was literally the same spot I gave up this morning that got me stuck in San Antonio in the first place.\\n\\nI get on my flight from San Antonio to Houston. It's delayed, but not that much and I make it just in time to make my connection. I board in Houston and proceed to sit on the plane for an hour, then the gate for another hour, as a massive thunderstorm continues to generate directly over the airport.\\n\\nWe leave 2 and a half hours late. The leg from Houston to Memphis was completely full, the leg from Memphis to Atlanta was nearly empty, and the final leg from Atlanta to Richmond was nearly full. We land at about 1:30AM and I stumble to the baggage claim. I'll finally be home!\\n\\nMy bag isn't there. When they switched everything around in San Antonio the gate agent had no way of giving me actually confirmation that my bag was switched, just a promise that they would take care of it. I trusted them, but I guess somewhere along the line my bag got lost in the shuffle.\\n\\nAll in all, it was 20 hours of travel through 7 different airports: Lubbock to Dallas to San Antonio to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. 13 of those hours were spent in Texas, trying to navigate weather and mechanical issues. My checked bag is nowhere to be found. \\n\\nTl;dr: Try not to fly in Texas in the Summer after 1PM, you **WILL** get delayed by weather. Also, always bring snacks and an extra pair of clothes.   \n",

I’m planning a trip through the USA for me and my girlfriend. We don’t have an exact date yet, but we’d like to go in the summer period. \\n\\nI have planned the route out according to our mutual interests but I was wondering if someone had some advice on certain points or maybe ideas for places we shouldn’t miss. We’re the kind of travellers that enjoy passing through as much as hotspots as possible. We did several trips already with a fully loaded schedule, but always well planned so that we get to see everything in a short amount of time. And yes, people have called us crazy more then once haha.  So in general, this is our itinerary:\\n\\nDay 1: Amsterdam - Seattle (by plane). We want to visit the Hoh Rain Forest and the Boeing Museum.\\nDay 4: Seattle - Portland (with rental car all the way to Las Vegas). We thought that the Multnomah Falls and the Japanese Gardens would be cool to visit. \\nDay 7: Portland - San Francisco where we would want to check out downtown, the Golden Gate and Alcatraz\\nDay 10: San Francisco - Los Angeles where we’d have a full beach day and visits to Hollywood (and the sign ofc haha) and Beverly Hills\\nDay 14: Los Angeles - Las Vegas. Here we’d like to visit the strip ofcourse. But as we’re both not the gambling type of persons we wouldn’t want to stay for more than a night or two. \\nDay 16: Las Vegas - Santa Fe. In LV, we’d like to rent a RV and make a pitstop to slee in Santa Fe. We’d like to pass the Hoover Dam and visit The Grand Canyon.\\nDay 17: Santa Fe - Oklahoma City. This would be a driving day and the drop off for the RV. Maybe someone knows cool spots somewhere in between where we could stay or visit? Or maybe cool things in Oklahoma?\\nDay 18: Oklahoma City - St Louis (by plane). As we’re both Bosnians, we cant visit the USA without visiting St. Louis lol.\\nDay 19: St. Louis - Chicago (by rental car all the way to Washington DC). If someone has tips on nice scenic routes or hotspots on the road, please share! In Chicago we’d like to do a River cruise, check the Magnificent Mile, the famous Willis Tower and the Skydeck. \\nDay 22: Chicago - DuBois. This would be a driving day where we’d make a pitstop in DuBois.\\nDay 23: DuBois - New York City: \\tI’m a huge fan of the Big Apple. So I’d like to go all out here. This means Greenwich Village, The Vessel, North 5th Pier, Rockefeller, Central Park ofcourse and the Empire State, Ground Zero, Grand Central Station, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, SoHo, the Waldorf Astoria (only from the outside lol)\\nDay 29: New York City - Washington DC. Hellooo Joe Biden! We’d go visit the White House, The Capitol, Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian. \\nDay 32: Washington DC - New Orleans (by plane). We’d go visit the French Quarter, Garden District, Oak Alley and we were recommended to do the Ghost Tour.\\nDay 35: New Orleans - Orlando (with rental car all the way to Miami). Orlando is all about Universal Studios and Disney World for us haha. We’d stay in the Portofino one as we think he has the best scenery!\\nDay 39: Orlando- Miami. Our trio would end in Miami. I don’t know what are cool places to visit but we’d stay maybe 3-4 days and enjoy sunny days on Miami Beach. \\n\\nSo that’s it in a nutshell. If someone has tips, let me know! Budgetwise, we have something like 30k USD for everything.   \n",

(if i only do one, i am leaning towards amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in november but totally open to suggestions)\\n\\n\\- i will have a car in tuscany so i would consider driving up the coast to cinque terre. is this something you would recommend? or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to cinque terre? if not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the lucca (or surrounding) area?\\n\\n\\- due to the time of the year, i have been told that southern italy has much better weather. i am open to trimming the tuscany portion to explore more of southern italy. if so, what are some areas near amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?\\n\\nthanks in advance!   \n",

       "1067  for the last few months we've been getting multiple posts a day on american passport questions to help alleviate the amount of posts and make sure everyone is getting the same information i've created this megathread ___ for questions on covid vaccine passports please use the covid megathread st post in r travel ___ the best advice is apply and renew early always check your passport's expiration date put your passport in a safe and secure place where you will not lose it do not check expiration or location of passport the night before check it early ___ the spring summer passport megathread can be found here ___ american passport information how to apply all information can be found here there will be a form to fill out information on passport photos what documents ids you'll need etc where to apply then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at this could be an acceptance facility like a local usps office an actual passport agency or via mail for renewals if you are applying outside of the us please see this information note many locations still have covid protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins processing times within the us as of september you can find the latest processing times here normal processing is around weeks expedited processing is around weeks you also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility that is an added cost is an additional add on to expedited passports life or death urgent emergency service is around hours business days and you can book these appointments starting weeks from your travel date you can only make an appointment by calling or tdd tty note this timing may not include shipping time there have been issues in the past of usps causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times note some facilities may be quicker others may take longer the above time is the average we have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate do not book travel to the day of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport because again it does not include shipping times note it can take up to weeks before your status changes to in process some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than weeks but not all do not plan on being lucky get your application in early and expedited as needed ___ frequently asked questions for applying within the us what is the status of my application check here they cashed my check does that mean my passport is coming soon no during covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to weeks them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well once they start processing it if they find errors or your paperwork ids etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues can i get a same day passport not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments my trip is in a few days and i just realized i don't have my passport it's lost it's expired whatever help what do i do in all honesty you are pretty much sol it is almost impossible to get the urgent life or death emergency in person appointments for these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link if you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to including flying to them note that many people have faked life or death emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now not happening trip my trip is within the next weeks and i n...   \n",
