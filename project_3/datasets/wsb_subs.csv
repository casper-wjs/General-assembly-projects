I know it is heavily focused on FedEx, but theres a lot of reading between the lines here and it all looks amazing for Atlas Air.

\----

**Recap**

In [Part 1 of my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/) on Atlas Air WorldWide (AAWW) I outlined the following points:

* AAWW trades at a P/E of &lt;5
* AAWW is hugely benefiting from global supply disruptions
* Those supply disruptions have no end in sight
* Even when they do end, the shift of passenger airlines to narrow-body jets will drop airfreight volume capabilities by \~20%, and AAWW will be needed to fill this gap
* 13.6% of the float is shorted
* The CARES act restriction on buybacks will end **this month**.

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

\----

**FedEx Earnings Call**

&gt;Turning now to International, we are forecasting air cargo market to be more than $80 billion by calendar year 2025... **We expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022, a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024.** Global air cargo capacity ... is still down 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Capacity on international lanes remain scarce and we have seen European and APAC export demand recover to pre-pandemic levels. -Brie Carere, *Chief Marketing and Communications Officer*

**FedEx Earnings**

Today we got to hear earnings from FedEx (FDX), a major global shipper and customer of AAWW. But yesterday, we got a sneak preview when it was announced that [FedEx is increasing its rates by 5.9% to 7.9% next year](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/business/fedex-shipping-price-increase/index.html). For your reference, that's the most in [over a decade](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/fedex-raise-rates-most-decade) \- a clear indicator that they don't expect their costs to come down.

In [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/comment/hdr1bfv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), before the earnings were released, I made it clear what we want to see from FedEx: high revenues and high costs. And that is exactly what we saw. Revenues are up pretty significantly (on top of a strong year when stay at home drove high delivery volumes) - this signals strong demand. But the bigger, most beautiful line item is ""Purchased Transportation."" FedEx spent $5.66B on outsourced transport this quarter. That is almost 14% higher than this same time last year.

[FedEx Earnings Strong, Expenses Stronger](https://preview.redd.it/980yspczy1p71.png?width=2692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be75953044ed232a714c664b7cd7afafba5f70c)

Now, I know what you think... ""How do we know how much of that Purchased Transportation went to airfreight?"" Good news. They split it out by segment. On page 23 of the report, FedEx states the following:

[FedEx Statement on Purchased Transportation Costs, page 23](https://preview.redd.it/717oaiu1z1p71.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0f8de62b89b1b5d9af4566f5cd3cb9d3886e52)

I will emphasize the higher volumes at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight...!

Now, it's safe to assume:

* FedEx Ground labor costs have nothing to do with our beloved Atlas Air.
* FedEx Express consists of a decent chunk of airfreight.
* FedEx Freight is significantly airfreight.

\--

**FedEx Express**

* Purchased Transportation costs increased 19% YOY, from 1.3B to 1.55B this quarter. \[Page 28\]
* Statement: ""Purchased transportation expense increased 19% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher utilization of third-party transportation providers and increased rates."" \[Page 29\]

Now, to be clear, the majority of FedEx Express's *Purchased Transportation* is almost certainly not airfreight. The actual percentage of increased expense on outsourced airfreight is probably better indicated in FedEx Freight...

**FedEx Freight**

* Purchased Transportation costs increased **41% YOY**, from 170M to 239M. \[Page 31\]
* Statement: ""Purchased transportation expense increased 41% in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the challenging labor market resulting in increased utilization of third-party service providers and higher rates."" \[Page 32\]

This is a huge indicator not just of FedEx's spend with Atlas Air, but the general market void that AAWW is filling...!

\--

**So Where Are We Now?**

The FedEx earnings report could not have gone any better for Atlas. The numbers speak volumes. But beyond that, FedEx spells it out for us quite clearly in their Business Outlook section, and the section capturing their future aircraft orders.

The Business Outlook section includes this fun reading:

&gt;""However, we expect costs associated with the challenging labor market, **including increased purchased transportation costs**, higher labor costs, and network inefficiencies, **to continue to pressure operating profit growth during the remainder of 2022.**"" - Page 25, Outlook

And the Commitments section makes it even more clear:

&gt;During the first quarter of 2022, **FedEx Express exercised options to purchase an additional 20 B767F aircraft, ten of which will be delivered in 2024 and ten of which will be delivered in 2025**. - Page 16

And sure enough, as of this morning, we got news that FedEx [expanded its agreement with Atlas](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/22/2301286/34720/en/Atlas-Air-Worldwide-Announces-New-ACMI-Contract-with-FedEx.html). You can bet that expanding that agreement right now was at top dollar.

TL;DR FedEx might as well have said ""We're so desperate to move freight that we gave Atlas Air a blank check...and they cashed it for so much money we had to raise rates higher/faster than we have in over a decade. And we bought 20 additional planes...which wont be delivered for 2-3 years.""

ElectroFried,t2_qxk72,1632316360,pt79cw,True,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pt79cw/i_think_i_worked_out_what_has_had_burry_and/,1,"Ok, so I have done a little research on this topic, and what the fallout from Evergrande could look like. I was bouncing around on twitter and I saw Michael Burry was getting all worked up about Evergrande. Now, I have no background in finance other than a personal interest in learning, but from my limited understanding I could not see anything at first in the information he linked and from other sources to that would point to a widespread collapse like he was claiming. I mean, Evergrande is big, but they hold $300+ billion in assets. Even if they are forced to restructure the losses could not be that bad globally right?  They only have about $18 Billion in foreign bonds outstanding on the international market, how could that lead to a global crash? Sure, the slowdown in China overall as a result will cause pain to some countries, like Australia, but not a global crash right?  
  
So I did a little more digging, and one of the things the data Burry linked to very specifically in his tweet said to look at the dates, in relation to the bonds starting to devalue in May this year. Well, thanks to the power of google, I learn that in May China started to crack down on 'shadow lending' or 'off the books lending' right when their public bonds started to turn to dog poo.  
  
And here we go, the rabbit hole. What the hell is shadow lending?   
  
Well, it all starts with this little policy China introduced in August last year to slow down the growth of their insane property markets. It is called the three line policy. I won't bore you with the details, google exists, go use it if you want. The TL;DR is if developers in China cross these lines in how much debt they have compared to assets, the amount of new debt they can take on is restricted. You cross all three, you turn red and can no longer grow the amount of debt you have. At least not on the books anyway... Evergrande crossed that line last year, it has not been allowed to 'legally' grow the amount of debt it has since then.   
  
Bring in the shadow banking system! The orphan special purpose vehicle. From my understanding, this system works much like this. Evergrande spins up what is called an orphan special purpose vehicle, this SPV, if it is based offshore, does not need to follow the laws in place in regards to the three red lines. Evergrande can then use the funds in that SPV like they would a loan, but without having to declare it on their books at all, they don't technically own the debt, some other fake business in say, the Caymans does in return for interest that Evergrande just happens to pay (or not).  
  
So, what does this mean?! Well... this is what I think Burry and others have been attempting to warn us about. What we know about the extent of Foreign debt in China is only the tip of the iceberg. Evergrande and other developers in China may hold much higher international liabilities than anyone is aware of, these SPV's are off the books, unrelated to Evergrande in any way other than being a source of liquidity for them to use. Who paid in to these SPV's? What is the total value of debt outstanding? If they get restructured will they repay these SPV's? No one knows... Well, some people do, but they are not talking. Ever since they have been restricted from issuing new bonds, or taking out loans, they have had to have been getting cash from somewhere and their asset sales are simply not enough to cover their costs to continue to grow, especially at the discounted prices recently.    
  
I know this is a wall of text but I think this might be very important and could be why some of the largest international investment funds have been in talks with Evergrande and the CCP. This problem could be much larger than anyone knows. Many international entities may have much more exposure to Evergrande and other aspects of the Chinese real estate market than anyone understands and when they get restructured those SPV investors will certainly be left holding the bag. Is this literally GFC 2.0, did those hedge funds and investment firms get greedy again and try to take a larger slice of the massive $50 Trillion dollar Chinese real estate market with SPVs? Is that what has Burry and others all worked up? Am I being incredibly 'Smooth brain' and missing something key here? Please let me know because I am more than a little concerned now.",wallstreetbets,"I think I worked out what has had Burry and others worked up about Evergrande.

**Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

**Part 3 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Part 4 – Recent Updates**

**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**

**Part 6 – Bear Case**

**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**

**Part 8 – TL;DR**

**Part 1 – Introduction**

It was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason – **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day – GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the ‘meme mania’ we’ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. 

Why’d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there’s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD’s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‘meme stocks’ which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don’t know, haven’t investigated that particular theory but there’s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you’re so inclined. 

The quick point I’m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question – and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule – seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems – for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**

**Part 2 – Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

* From an investment into equities point of view – S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month — other than a slight dip in February — over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) 

* Let’s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it’s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   

* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) 

* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). 

* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)

* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. 

* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) 

* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) 

* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  

* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois’ clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). 

* By 2030, there’s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market.

**Part 2 – Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Before we look into what’s happened since my last post, let’s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. 

It is this modular platform that led to Apple’s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).

Apple wasn’t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia’s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‘pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal… Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company’ [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). 

Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo’s chairman didn’t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of Canoo’s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo’s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) 

Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).

Let’s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo’s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). 

The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It’s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants

* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo’s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 – layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) 

The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:

Lifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It’s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I’d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching late 2022.

* Starting at $34,750*

* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats

* 250 mi range

* Up to 350 Horsepower 

* 28min charge time 80%

* 188 ft³ interior volume

* 80 KWh battery

* 1,464 lbs payload – 2,000 lbs capacity

Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) – Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Starting at $33,000*

* 200 ft³ - 500 ft³ cargo volume

* 130 – 230 mi, 90 – 190 mi range (EPA)

* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs

Pickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) – All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility — ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching as early as 2023.

* Price – Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category – you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  

* Targeted HP – 500+

* Payload Capacity – 1800 lbs

* Range – 200+ mi

* Powertrain – AWD or RWD

There’s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn’t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). 

We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It’s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity – highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). 

Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer – with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 – 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).

To sum it up – Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).

Some of these individuals have spent 5-10 years with their prior companies, it doesn’t make sense that they’d all be jumping over to Canoo for a 1 year engagement.**

Other than the talent, Canoo has made a number of moves in in recent months as it moves closer to bringing the first of the Lifestyle Vehicles to production, including:

Announcing plans to build its new factory outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma, creating more than 2,000 jobs and opening in 2023. The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).

Partnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‘is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.” The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)

De-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:

* &gt;$250M invested in Beta

* ~1.5M hours of engineering

* ~500k miles of testing

* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested

* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.

Undertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:

* &gt;12 months of testing

* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated

* ~70 crash tests

* 30 sled tests

* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts

* 80% of all components are sourced

* 63% of all engineering is released

* 54% of tooling is committed

Partnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military. With more than 100 franchisees with experience in delivering for companies like Amazon, XPO, Axlehire and Ontrac, the company, aims to expand that to 300 franchisees by the end of this year [link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network). 

Surpassing 9,500 non-binding pre-orders across lifestyle vehicle, pickup track and multi-purpose delivery vehicle [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/second-quarter-2021-results) 

Showcasing its vehicles at various events including the ACT Expo and Cars &amp; Coffee (both of which were attended by some of the amazing folks at the canoo subreddit who attended, took detailed notes/pictures and shared it with everyone), and receiving invites to others such as the LA Auto show [link](https://gyazo.com/ff9b83052183c0128970b65c4e05aa55).

**Part 5 – Financials and Valuation**

Before looking at Canoo/Competitors, here are some analyst PTs

* R.F. Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) 

* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) 

* Bank of America - $5 (can’t find the article at the moment but I’m sure I’ve seen it somewhere)

Average = $13, current SP = $6.7

As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). 

The company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.

At a pre-revenue stage there’s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:

* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders – which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).

* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).

As far as valuations go, let’s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look – based on their market cap. I’m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I’ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.

* Lucid Motors – $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021

* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 

* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 

* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 

* Canoo – $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV 

* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B

Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven’t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there’s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo’s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  

**Part 6 – Bear Case**

With anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that’s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I’m on the bullish side for the company, I’ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won’t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market – these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I’ll summarize them below:

* As of Canoo’s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. 

* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.

* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.

* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production – H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn’t make much sense to go the additional equity route.

* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) – nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.

**Part 7 – SI and Squeeze Potential**

I know y’all have just been waiting for this so I’ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that’ll help understand GOEV’s squeezability.

* Short Interest – 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float 

* Market Cap – $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it’s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital

* Extremely Memeable – I mean… GOEV, like Go… EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria

* Low Liquidity – Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)

* Low Risk (IV) – Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you’re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it’s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There’s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn’t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I’d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.

**Part 8 – TL;DR**

The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. 

President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. 

Canoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.

To facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo’s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else’s lineup… take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo’s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)

* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

If we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it’s $4,000 rebate – that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you’re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.

If you made it this far, I’d like to thank you for reading this – I’d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won’t). They’re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company – from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups.

Global oil demand has recently risen to near-record levels as global activity picks up steam despite the pandemic.

In response, OPEC+ agreed to increase oil production starting in August by another 400,000 bpd each month. But not all producers have responded to the call for more barrels. 

Angola, Nigeria, and Kazahkstan have been unable to lift their oil production to meet the call for more oil. In Kazakhstan's case, this was due to maintenance in its Tengiz field—maintenance which ended mid-September. For Angola and Nigeria, years of underinvestment in their oil industry has rendered them unable to respond quickly to increased demand.

The current plan is for OPEC+ to [continue increasing production](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Oil-Prices-Climb-As-OPEC-Stands-Firm-On-Production-Plan.html) by another 400,000 bpd in October and another 400,000 bpd in November.

Two Reuters sources said on Tuesday that OPEC+'s compliance with the cuts [rose to 116%](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/OPEC-Boosts-Compliance-With-Oil-Production-Cuts-To-116.html) in August, excluding Mexico.

Meanwhile, U.S. production has also been hampered—in this case, due to Hurricane Ida. Production has dipped by 1.5 million bpd in recent weeks, adding to the tight supply situation created by OPEC+'s underperformers.

Add to what some see as inadequate production the tight supply situation for natural gas in Europe. This could also increase the demand for crude oil and gas supplies run thin.

Iraqi Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said over the weekend that if all goes to plan, the market will remain in balance through Q1 2022, with Brent at $70 per barrel, if OPEC+ sticks to its plan.

**Opinion:**

There appears to be a common misconception that if oil prices get to high, ""OPEC will just turn on the spigot"" or ""US Shale will come roaring back with production to fill the supply gap.""  While that could've been true in the past, the game has completely changed due to under investment (both OPEC and US) and  and it appears that we are absolutely headed for $80-100/barrel by the end of the year.  **Prove me wrong!**

With all of the above stated...

# I think that Marathon Oil (MRO) is the best way to play the eventual Oil Price boom 

* **MRO (Marathon Oil) is up over 200% from it's October lows**
* **MRO breakeven is below $35/barrel**
* **MRO has committed 40% of Free Cash Flow to Stock Buy-Backs = Over $1 Billion for 2021 (Q3/Q4)**
   * ***That's currently over 10% of their Market Cap***
* **MRO paid down $1.4 Billion in long-term debt in Q1/Q2 of 2021**
* **MRO is the smallest Oil Company in the S&amp;P 500** (not a Micro Cap that could be bought easily)
* **Bank of American and Goldman Sachs are predicting $80-100/barrel by end of 2021**
* \*\*There are other solid US Equity Oil plays out there, but I feel that MRO is in the best position to boom given their solid balance sheet, low-break even point, and being the **smallest market cap  company of any US Oil Company in the S&amp;P 500** (i.e. institutional/long-term investors will be more likely to pour money into an S &amp; P 500 company than a micro cap once it's fully realized that oil US companies are committed to investor returns vs the old ""drill baby drill"" mentality.

However, it’s funny how everyone is calling them P&amp;D’s. The majority of these deSPAC squeezes happened out of the blue when no one was pumping them. It is crazy market phenomena - a company goes public through a SPAC that was eaten up by arb funds and the new company now has a micro float because those arbs redeemed &gt;90% of the original shares. Look at Effector Therapeutics chart, not a single soul knew about that merger and it randomly rips to $40 a week after ticker change. Since mid-August, every time I thought the &gt;90% redeemed deSPACs were done they have just continued to rip higher. 

I’ve been following these deSPAC squeezes since news came out that 92% of IRNT shares had been redeemed upon merger. You could still buy Oct. 12.5c for $0.05/contract, IV was nonexistent because it had been pinned to $10 for months.

OPAD will be the next one. Ortex data shows that 15.77m shares are shorted (unable to attach pictures). However, Ortex is pulling its data from a source that has calculated the current float size WITH the PIPE shares that have yet to be unlocked. 

OPAD had ~80% of its shares redeemed upon SPAC merger, so the new float is 3,400,000 shares. PIPE shares will not be unlocked until the end of October or later.

I’ll give you my thoughts as someone who has spent their career as an investment professional in both hedge fund land and as a private equity investor (current job).

The first thing to recognize is that China operates very differently — their government’s motives aren’t based on economic prosperity like Western governments…it’s control. Look no further than how they were willing to shoot their entire big tech industry in the gut to bring it to heel under the party’s control.

So what happens I’m not 100% sure, but the actions taken will be whatever maximizes party control. I personally think that’s quasi-nationalization.

If they let it default it will be catastrophic contagion. China doesn’t care about a business going under…it cares about risks to the financial system that in turn pose political risk to the party.

The market has been expecting this for a while and yesterday was in my opinion more behaviorally based knee jerk reaction. We’ve been overdue for a 5-10% correction (based on historic patterns which I realize aren’t necessarily predictive of the future) so this feels like a good excuse to initiate selling waves which becomes self fulfilling.

If you want to know how this plays out just look towards historic precedent for over leveraged businesses in China that pose risks to the system. In the case of HNA, for example, the playbook was to essentially take over the business and cut lose debt where they don’t care about the relationship and paying off those who they do care about. So someone like HSBC would be fine whereas a smaller foreign bank may get burnt. Any large international a bank is important enough that the party is going to make them whole or close to it, mitigating concerns for systematic contagion. And the quantum of debt is not too much of a dent to China’s balance sheet, especially compared to the money printing that’s gone on for covid stimulus.

Personally I am going to buy in on what I think is an overreaction and a lot of market noise where people have been looking for an excuse to sell off. The selling yesterday was actually very orderly and you saw a lot of institutions unwind their hedges (buying back their covered calls). And new option volume did not suggest the market is now incrementally more bearish. 

Tl;dr:
- The key is to understand which constituencies within evergrande’s debt burden China cares about keeping happy and how much debt those they don’t care about have on their balance sheets
- Yesterday was an overreaction but selling was calm and orderly (not a panic) and most people took out their downside hedges (a bullish signal)

LIDR is actually an interesting company, with minimal downside (trades at low $7 at the moment).

LIDR has an 84.5% redemption rate as shown [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C65RwHVSLOUKkuJaf3RgkeDiuMmhrMMKYncfM7YrF0U/htmlview#gid=0). OI in the option chain is ridiculous compared to the float.

After redemptions, LIDR's new float is \~3.64m. At $12.50, about 1.15m 9/17 and 740k 10/15 worth of LIDR shares are in the money.

With some volume, the price action will for sure surprise everyone.

A synthetic short spread involves buying a Put option ATM or near the money, Selling a Call Options ATM or NTM, And buying a call option deep OTM so your broker limits your margin requirements.

Example:   SPY @435

Buy $430 Put SPY 
Sell $438 Call Spy
Buy $460 Call Spy

This trade will provide about a $20-30 credit (money that lands in your account upfront) 💸💸.  

If share price rises Max Loss is $460-438 x 100 = $2200 per contract

If share price falls max gain is $430 x 100 = 43,000 per contract (this will only happen if America falls into total Mad Max economic ruin)

It seems a few minutes of red has everyone jumping ship when there’s an authentic squeeze play. 

Short squeeze is only “mOoN” on WSB within 2 hours or next - that’s not actually how it works. There are ebs and flows to ALL squeeze plays, take a breath.

It takes time - sometimes weeks or months - for the stock to pop. The time is required because the short positions have deadlines to cover their positions or pay fees/interest. 

The longer they hold, the more penalties and interest they pay - they’re motivated and bound to buy back their shares for this reason. When they do, and there’s a strong floor (which there is in the case of SDC) - the price climbs. 

When others start to close their short positions, it climbs higher. Then, more WSB actual retards and others see green and get in - driving it higher. 

In the interim there’s fear from lack of knowledge (like you’re seeing posts of “SDC iS OvEr”) and sell outs - causing dips. 

Another reason you see interim dips is short positions may also sell mass amounts in a day to create the illusion of a dip so that fear from the retards strikes in and they sell out. 

Bought more yesterday and even more today.

But Discover Financial ($DFS) will be the first major credit card network to go BNPL on all their merchants. As most of us are aware, $DFS has always been one of those large traditional banking companies, and the large banks are starting to feel the pressure from BNPL encroaching on their domain. 

They mentioned back in February that they were partnering with Sezzle (one of the second-tier BNPLs) and looking into launching a BNPL offering. In this [Nilson Report](https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1369/sezzle/) about Sezzle (that has been relatively obscure), we can see that they are trying to add a BNPL solution for all their US Enterprise Clients on the Discover Global Network. Enterprise clients refer to all the giant chain-stores. 

Then in July, they invested a [further $30M into Sezzle](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/discover-backs-sezzle-with-30m-to-offer-shoppers-buy-now-pay-later-tool/).

Now if negotiations go smoothly, which I imagine they are, then Discover could become one of the largest BNPL providers in the US, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with Affirm's offering, on top if its current financial services.

Understand; banks primarily make money through mortgages. If default risk increases (expected home values tank) then banks are upside down - they will have no money to loan and will not let you withdraw. And before you fucks start in with FDIC fucker. Let me tell you about the speed of fucking government. It's fucking SLOW.

Now that we understand this. Why does our market have to have its vibe fucking wrecked? Globalization. Globalization is sold as an ide of a common collective rising tides lift all ships and that kind of fucking shit.

What globalization really is is a way to increase risk by combing two cluster fucks into one. Hence our vibe is fucked right now. We control very well what happens within the US economy. We can't do Jack shit about what happens in China's, but because globalization let's go ahead a fuck up our vibe by mixing their real-estate with ours!

What globalization really is like is you giving me access to your bank account, I put in a little and say we have derisked and elevated our status. I then spend all the fucking money. You ask hey I thought we were in this together! I say yea, my rent is $20k a month and yours is $200. I have a loan for $1M that needs payments and you don't. So, I'm helping you by making sure our collective bills are paid on my side. Now when I default. You and I both have the account claimed by creditors.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.

INFO and CME group have introduced a new over-the-counter trading platform that does not utilize PFOF. Instead it is called Post trade work flow. More research is needed. 
They have released their intentions and the filings for it, just a few days ago.

Weirdly Over 5B in debt. Net income reported was 159M in May 21. At a stock evaluation of 22. per share in liquid capital. They're running out of physical cash as well as holding an uncomfortable short position considering WHO the Individuals whom are holding shares and that they purchased at $113 .. currently $121 

Ken griffin exited his position in Q2, June 25th, I cannot prove it but 8M volume and SEC filings don't  show his sale/ new buys being possible on any other day when you look at share price Vs date of purchase and what not.  despite stock forecast in futures show nothing of concern for him. George Soros and many other billionaires whom trade in close correlation with Ken Griffin, or Citadel securities, either increase their position or purchased a new position in Q2 &amp; Q3 as of most recent paperwork.

TLDR: FCTV is a SPAC taking Etoro public in Q4 2021 according to the CEO. The option prices have plummeted probably due to loss of interest in the stock. I'm expecting a spike in the prices when the merger date is announced. i think the February 2022 calls offer the most leverage with less risk of options expiring worthless. we get 100x leverage and 5 months of safety with this expiry date and strike price.

FTCV is a SPAC taking Etoro public at an evaluation of $10 billion. Etoro is a popular stock trading and crypt o trading platform outside of the United States. Their fundamentals have only improved since announcing the SPAC merger. In June they announced their Q2 2021 earnings which showed a 2300% revenue growth Year over year due in large part to massive growth in their crypt o trading platform. This puts them at an Annual run-rate of $1.2 billion. This give them a PS of around 10 which is very reasonable for a company growing this fast. I see 3 things that could give this stock a positive boost. 1. there was a spike in august with the HOOD hype. so there is a correlation in the 2 stocks 2. crypt makes up 70% of revenues as of june so crypt o hype should move this as well 3.

I am not the most educated on DRS systems; however, I will try my best to formulate my argument with objectivity. In short, it is bad simply due to it's limitations causing us to not have quick or precise sales during Squeeze and Swing plays. I have a long explanation below. This was originally meant for AMC Stock Sub but I don't have 420 Karma. This is good to know either way.

Here is a link to all advantages/disadvantages of DRS and other alternatives:
https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html

  First off, it's honestly pretty late to start using DRS. Transferring from broker to broker probably takes 1-2 weeks depending on where you're coming from and going to. Transferring to the DRS system takes about five business days from what I've read. We're all anticipating these upcoming market events to be catalysts to cause shifts in the market. With that being said, it doesn't make sense to transfer anywhere at this point; especially we really think the price is about to go up soon.

  Next, the shares will be in my name on the books of the company in the DRS system. Sounds good but this also gives the company more control than you think. How is that? If you click the SEC link I posted and read the DRS disadvantages, they tell you ""If you choose to buy or sell registered securities through a company's direct investment plan, you usually will not be able to buy or sell at a specific market price or at a specific time"".  ""Instead, the company will purchase or sell shares for the plan at established times — for example, on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis — and at an average market price"". Doesn't sound like a good trade off just to have my name registered; which is I think Blockchain tech is a counter that people advocate for.

  Additionally, you don't even know exactly when the MOASS will happen. Say if the MOASS does happen next week and you use DRS, you won't be able to capitalize as quickly as you want. On top of that, not everyone is using this using this DRS system and they have quicker alternatives. You'll have some of retail selling in increments and institutions selling in larger increments. Then you have Short Sellers making new positions as the stock reaches new highs. You could be left bagholding if it takes 5-7 days for DRS to sell like some experienced DRS holders are saying. A very bad scenario that can happen is if brokers take away the buy button again and then companies screw over DRS holders by not permitting capitalization on the MOASS because of them possibly having policies against Volatile stocks. 

  So my opinion is that the DRS/Computershare thing is bad for right now. For squeeze and swing plays, we need to get in, hold until we see desirable numbers and then quickly get out. If my mobile brokerage app and current non-DRS trading account has the power to sell my shares at whatever price I want that's what I'm going with. A non-DRS account is objectively better for this situation. So yeah, pushing for Computershare does come across as misinformation, FUD, etc.",wallstreetbets,Is Computershare/DRS Bad For A Squeeze,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prc2z3/is_computersharedrs_bad_for_a_squeeze/

The annual chart for $SDC shows an interesting trend. All previous moves up were on relatively small volume. The current surge in price accompanies an unprecedented volume surge of 297M not to mention the impending bullish MACD crossover. What does this mean? That the recent jump is only the beginning of a bigger run.

[Fig.2. Chart displaying the historical volume moves of $SDC showing the huge recent surge.](https://preview.redd.it/r23yr7tjtho71.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01d797b952f55652cf3f262115935ca10b393aff)

Where this thing gets interesting is using curve fitting.

Fitting the curve of recent price action yields a polynomial equation which can be used to predict the future price moves. Yes, its not an exact method by any means. This is not some hedge fund also, alas we know that the volume is making large moves. We know the price is making consistent moves up.

*TMC, OPAD, and IRNT were supposed to go to the fucking moon, right? Why the hell didn’t they? Because you have an obsession with OTM call options.* 

First off, answer this question for me: Which call option strikes have the highest gamma? Go ahead, I’m sure you YOLOing mother fuckers know that before you drop your 100k on **GAMMA** SQUEEZE, right?

Here’s some pictures I drew on to help you. These are the option chains for each of last week’s favorites. I’ll highlight the call strike that has the highest gamma. 

**TLDR in section III.**

&amp;#x200B;

[  The Iron Giant – You degenerates saw $100 a share everywhere and really went for it. Look at all that open interest at $40. Those MFers were expensive. Look at that, by the end of Friday they only had a delta of 3.1, so about 3 shares hedged for each of those calls. Ouch. ](https://preview.redd.it/fj133ltavho71.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ae7fd171c61e4100e0aeb113bf72c50daac486)

&amp;#x200B;

[ What strikes? First one in the money, first one out of the money. OPA! ](https://preview.redd.it/45jh9ltavho71.jpg?width=1157&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c0ffc619e959f76906068314dc368ee61b46d8)

&amp;#x200B;

[  TMC – You were supposed to be the chosen one! 160&amp;#37; short interest, massive gamma, low share price.](https://preview.redd.it/ijhuhjtavho71.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ebdc63c195aa7749527ef0728e50a24858c654d)

&amp;#x200B;

But wait a second, doesn’t gamma move with the stock? Absolutely. And now we learn HOW to gamma.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Buying ATM options is to Gamma Squeezes as Buying and Holding Shares is to Short Squeezes**

So now you know, the highest gamma is the first strike in the money, and first strike out of the money. What does this mean, and why is this the highest gamma position?

A gamma squeeze is essentially taking advantage of market maker delta hedging. The “idea” here is that there is a rush to own shares in large lots as the price moves. The whole purpose of buying a call option is to lock in a price to own 100 shares. It’s an insurance package. If you are buying at the money options, your breakeven price is pretty close to, but just a bit higher than the share price, depending on volatility (vega gang). 

The *implied* sentiment behind buying at the money options is that you are expecting a continued rise in share price. If you were to go further in the money, you are expecting the share price to remain the same (break even = share price). If you go out of the money, you’re expecting a miracle and want to donate money to the market maker’s party fund. 

So what this means for a gamma squeeze, is that in order for it continue, option buying must reflect an *implied sentiment of continued rise in share price*. 

&amp;#x200B;

**III.** **If I want to squeeze the gamma, how do I get the juice? READ THIS IT’S YOUR TL;DR**

**SMALL LOTS at a time,**  **BUY FIRST STRIKE IN THE MONEY – SELL OFF WHEN 5+ strikes ITM and buy more ATM**

Buy the first strike in the money, every time. It doesn’t matter the share price. If you are expecting a gamma squeeze, always buy the first strike in the money, or if you’re really a damn cheapskate, get the first one out of the money.

When the share price rises and puts your call a strike or two in the money, buy another small lot at the money again. Continue to do this.   
 Now once the share price puts your calls 5+ strikes in the money, sell dem bitches and get more AT THE MONEY. The gamma on the calls deep in the money has played out. 

In the money calls have a maximum delta of 100. If you can sell an in the money call, and buy two at the money calls with a delta of 60, now you are effecting a combined delta of 120 on the stock. Your power is growing and the market makers must now hedge even more delta. 

Let’s look at IRNT for next week. Do you know what you nitwits have done? You’ve opened up massive open interest far out of the money and there’s almost ZERO in the money calls open. You want a gamma squeeze you’re gonna have to get sell off those OTM options and buy at the money. I promise you, the share price will not reach your $70 strike option without significant buy volume. The market makers are bringing the majority of the volume as they delta hedge, and they’re not going to hedge all those calls that are $40 out of the money. There’s zero reason to. In fact, as we approach expiration, their delta gets LOWER and shares are SOLD by market makers. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Okay, you've already shot yourselves in the foot, but maybe it can be fixed?](https://preview.redd.it/pvho43sqvho71.jpg?width=782&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a98487e6213179783b1f1c1cd7e61c5c762792)

  

Alright, so repeat after me, for a GAMMA squeeze, you buy options with the HIGHEST GAMMA. Which ones are they? First strike in the money, first strike out of the money. 

&amp;#x200B;

CriRok,t2_3vi73na,1631979975,pqot4l,True,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqot4l/irnt_weird_situation/,1,"Okay so.

First of all i wanted to say that i have exited most of my shares and only have about 10% of my original amount of shares left in $IRNT.

Now, i see alot of people talking about the people still holding $IRNT are bagholders.

I would like to argue that its not the case. 

$IRNT had a whole 5 green days. Almost no real dips. 

The dips we have seen so far have all been real minor. From 45 to 36 and the right back up to +40. 

This dip that we are in right now is not at all a huge dip if you look at the bigger picture. 

For the people that bought $IRNT last monday, this dip is nothing, we're all still in the green.

Now looking at the charts, every run we've had has come with a dip after it. Now the difference is this run we've had has been huge there fore a bigger dip then usual.

&amp;#x200B;

And now you cant forget that there is a really important thing in stake here.

**MONEY**

We all love money, we are addicted  to money, we will go to any extent to get our money.

And we cannot forget that we are batteling against huge Hedge Funds with alot more capital then the average Joe has.

They are risking their jobs, for this. 

They are not going to let us just predict a squeeze like that, they knew people were ready, they knew that people thought Friday was the **BIG DAY**.

What other way to make people sell than to disapoint their huge expectations.

We've already seen this before with **GME**, the extent to which the Hedge Funds went were extreme.

The tactics they used were under the belt, all for a bit of money.

They arent going to let us apes become rich and thats a fact, the system is rigged, and theres not much we can do about it.

So back to $IRNT

We saw a dip which was not according to **OUR** plan.

But probably according to **THEIR** plan.

And many bought in to it, calling eachother bagholders, when a stock that has had a massive bullrun just had a correction with about -30%.

And listen im not an expert, and im not here to say that theres more to come from $IRNT.

But instead try to calm people down, cause people make this situation seem a lot worse than it is.

  
This could be an case of a large P&amp;D and has left people bagholding.

But this could also just be a dip which is going to lead to much greater things with a little bit of patience.

But remember this was only one market day, and i've been in on **GME** through many storms and disasters.   


And this is really nothing compared to that.

Im still in on $IRNT with a small portion of shares cause i dont want to miss out on a great play.

But take everything with a grain of salt and dont invest more than what you're willing to lose. 

Which is going to prevent these kind of situations.

Someone commented on a $TMC hype post asking: what does this company even do?

After getting berated by WSB finest short squeezers with: 

*“we don’t ask questions here”* 

*“do we even care?”* 

*“I think it’s a tech company”* 

*“this may be the least important question on a thread I have ever seen”*

I had to say something.. so I responded *“metals or something”*. I had no fucking idea what this company did either. But it got me researching, and the information I have found not only impresses me but also makes me hopeful for the future. 

Regardless, I was already in and you are too, and if you’re not, here is why you should.

At the end of the day, we’re here to make money so lets go

2 parts. First, what does this company actually do? Second, why this is the least important question right now.

None of this is financial advice, do your own DD.

I just learned how to read so if there’s mistakes let me know. 

# 

# Part 1. metals or something

Check out the [company website](https://metals.co). Lots of the information I will present can be found there, including their [investor site](https://investors.metals.co) and [8K filings](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-048261/). 

They have a film on the home page that describes this with moving graphics and cool shit. Pretty dope. 

**The problem:** Humans want shiny stuff and tech. Like cars and big buildings, and iphones to hear intelligent people discuss politics on twitter, or if our big brother AMC is worth 1 trillion or 100 trillion dollars. The issue is how much we’re fucking up our planet to get everyone what they want.

**Solution:** Decarbonizing global energy and transport

What do Teslas, and phones, and tech in general need? You guessed it: Pornhub access.

What’s the second thing they need? Metals.

Carbon-free systems will take billions of tons of metals to build. And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires… a fuck ton of metals. 

The cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0) 

[polymetallic nodule - metallic rock](https://preview.redd.it/3yxzn7dl2ao71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1056134cec18e052cf777cf54c236abf9b4b76d7)

&amp;#x200B;

These ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn’t the only thing scarred)

But these little guys, they bleed money. And I mean profusely. 

[base metals found in polymetallic nodules](https://preview.redd.it/nilu3g303ao71.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a8586b4d21ed4e4a1ad874b2190b76245fa0f8c)

&amp;#x200B;

They contain the base metals needed to make **batteries**. Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it’s estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion. 

TMC’s main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:

[the subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/ruknl1ce3ao71.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dbc28e5ddf8ea4a341730b4d7f71f97569164e5)

&amp;#x200B;

It goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.

The NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world’s** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).

To put it into perspective; Tesla is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021. 

And $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals. 

HOLY MOLY

That’s a lot of rocks. 

Their plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they’re looking to recycle the metals from [car batteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0)  and put the metals back into circulation.

[the plant](https://preview.redd.it/0i5kdx4s4ao71.png?width=2646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb85f9e9c759dcf97f14eb13d0ccaab7014ca480)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l55aix2n4ao71.jpg?width=581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9815d76b335ca7705e62daf9c58c97b04a317288

But Junkyard-Razor74, don’t we have metals on land that we’re mining? Why yes but back to the planet thing. We’re trying to save it right? Rightttt? 

&amp;#x200B;

[and that's just the start of climate spending](https://preview.redd.it/h45gxhk15ao71.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab2ed38b20e37d434aace4472613343cd8e4ece1)

Infrastructure, auto industry, transit, power sector, buildings, innovative technologies. They all need metals. And many of them batteries. This is where the metal company is positioning themselves to bank. The future is green 💵 💵 💵 ☘️☘️☘️

&amp;#x200B;

[land mining bad, sea mining good](https://preview.redd.it/pb52apxk5ao71.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62c59d48220b58afc1c53f9c67a4e006fae0e44b)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Using nodules to create EV batteries will generate at least **75% less CO2** than ores from land-based mines.

Cool. So now we’re on the same page. Electric cars have batteries, batteries need metals, TMC make batteries good for planet.

# Part 2. why it doesn’t matter (right now)

Information directly from form [8K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-048261/) dated 9/15/2021.

DeepGreen Metals and Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation (SOAC) completed Their business combination and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker $TMC on Sept 10th, 2021.

In connection with the closing of the transaction, The Metals Company expects to receive approximately **$137.5 million** **in cash** prior to transaction fees, including $27.2 million of proceeds distributed from the SOAC trust account after accounting for redemptions and **$110.3** **million** of proceeds from PIPE investors in the private placement.

SOAC acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital of DeepGreen:

The shareholders and the option holders of DeepGreen became entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for their DeepGreen Common Shares and options to purchase DeepGreen Common Shares, as applicable, an aggregate of **229,162,651 TMC Common Shares** (which includes TMC Common Shares underlying options).

Each Share is automatically convertible into TMC Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

SOAC entered into Subscription Agreements with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of **11,030,000 TMC Common Shares** at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of **$110,300,000** (the “PIPE Financing”).

SOAC also entered into Subscription Agreements for an aggregate of **22,000,000 Common Shares**, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of **$220,000,000** with two investors who defaulted on the Closing Date under the Subscription Agreements. The Company plans to aggressively pursue its available remedies with respect to such investors.

**In summary:** They got cash in the bank. Also, the total number of TMC Common Shares outstanding immediately following the Closing was approximately **224,385,324** comprising

* **203,874,981** TMC Common Shares issued to **DeepGreen shareholders** 
* **11,030,000** TMC Common Shares issued in connection with the Closing to the **PIPE Investors** pursuant to the PIPE Financing
* **6,759,000** TMC Common Shares held by the **initial shareholders** (which includes the Sponsor, Rick Gaenzle, Isaac Barchas and Justin Kelly) and…
* **2,721,343** TMC Common Shares held by **public shareholders**, reflecting **redemptions of 27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares.

Here’s the kicker:

**The Sponsor Group Holders and the DeepGreen Holders** (**203,874,981** TMC Common Shares) also **agreed not to effect any sale** or distribution of certain equity securities of the Company held by them **during the period ending on the earlier of (a) 180 days after the Closing**, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) subsequent to the Closing, (x) if the last reported sale price of the TMC Common Shares **equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading days** commencing after the closing.

Can’t sell them until blah blah blah.

**27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares **redeemed**.

**11,030,000** TMC Common Shares offered and sold to the PIPE Investors are currently **locked up**

So you’re telling me that around 3.6 million shares have been shorted… when SUPPOSEDLY the available public float is 2.7 million shares…

What am I missing here, are we all retarded? Did I actually learn how to read? 

The short interest data of 3.6 million shares short **seems to be** from when the float was larger, before redemption. Most of them **should’ve** covered. **IF** the short interest is the same then yes, the SI is over 100%+ 

I don’t even care about the short interest. It can be 30,000 or 3,000,000.

The public fucking float is **2.7 million shares**. According to the SEC filings and the CEO himself. Take a look: [Listen to the first 1 ½ minutes](https://twitter.com/TDANetwork/status/1438917219732312067?s=20).

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR:** The Metals Company is developing the world’s largest estimated source of battery metals, with enough nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese to electrify the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet. They do this through innovative technology and deep-sea mining, which is healthier for our planet and lucrative for our pockets in the long term.

People are on here complaining saying “oh why are all these stocks being discussed”, WSB isn’t the same. “I remember when we used to only YOLO on solid fundamental companies like TSLA &amp; APPLE so that if you fucked up your trade at least your not bagholding”.

First off, shut the fuck up. I do agree that the sentiment has changed a bit since prior to January 2020, but do you even know what WSB is about?

It’s about finding good trades that can like 5x to 10x your profits which also comes with high risk aka High Risk, High Reward trades … like 1-0DTE SPY calls or puts.

I’m not pushing $IRNT here, but I’m holding my bag until next week to see what happens. I think with its setup, high OI% for October, high SI%, and high CTB% that there’s something unique to come of it, “potentially”.

Fuck for a lot of you on here, prior to two weeks ago had no idea what a super 8-k was or a company completing a stock redemption from a DeSpac.

I’m in full exceptante of the L’s I take as it was my choice to partake. I can imagine posters of DD getting flack from people not getting “GaINs” or losing a fuck ton of money blame posters or ask them questions like, hey man I just dropped a bag on this stock how fucked am I? No one is going to answer you. That was your choice to play that play.

People complaining of stocks in this sub-reddit this week and saying ah man I miss the old days; when 95% of you weren’t even here back then.

You want to know why the DeSpacs high redemption are being discussed? Because of their Super 8-k (Redemption) and Option Chain activity.

These types of stocks can lead to gamma squeezes and high return for those who got in early before IV and on the run up when the stock was illiquid and IV is low, if that stock pops off, again, High Risk to High Reward plays, then that make sense.

For example, until lock up expires for the PIPE investors, I’ll use $IRNT as an example, it still has absurd Option Chain activity for October, high short interest, high CTB, closed at $30 which indicates to me dumb money is still holding strong, and a very small float that moves easily and has been proven to do so.

So, for me I’m rolling the dice and playing this into next week to see. But here’s the thing, I ChOsE tO tAkE tHaT rIsK … because I knew why I was going into that trade and if I get burnt that’s on me and me only, there’s no else to blame but myself and some of you pussies are forgetting that.

DeSpacs are hot right now because some of them have potential to make good money if your lucky and smart.

Plays like $IRNT are unique and if anything remind me more of old WSB then the current buy $WISH or buy $CLNE type shit.

There’s a lot of interesting plays out there as of lately, but don’t ever bitch and complain to a Mod or Redditor because your down and didn’t know why you got into  a trade.

This isn’t fucking Safe—Moon you quacks. If that’s your mentality then go join a subreddit similar to that.

This is a place where we take bets on trades that have at least some form of logical reasoning as a catalyst to occur.

Whether it be an Option Chain activity, highly shorted with a catalyst, Overbought, Calls or Puts because of JPowws money printer goes Brrrr, etc.

If you can’t eat a loss based on your own decision gracefully, and go straight to blaming others, then get the fuck out this sub.

Someone commented on a $TMC hype post asking: what does this company even do?

After getting berated by WSB finest short squeezers with:

*“we don’t ask questions here”*

*“do we even care?”*

*“I think it’s a tech company”*

*“this may be the least important question on a thread I have ever seen”*

I had to say something.. so I responded *“metals or something”*. I had no fucking idea what this company did either. But it got me researching, and the information I have found not only impresses me but also makes me hopeful for the future.

Regardless, I was already in and you are too, and if you’re not, here is why you should.

At the end of the day, we’re here to make money so lets go

2 parts. First, what does this company actually do? Second, why this is the least important question right now.

None of this is financial advice, do your own DD.

I just learned how to read so if there’s mistakes let me know.

# 

# Part 1. metals or something

Check out the company website. Lots of the information I will present can be found there, including their investor site, and 8K filings.

They have a film on the home page that describes this with moving graphics and cool shit. Pretty dope.

(Auto mod doesn't like the link, but it's metals dot co)

**The problem:** Humans want shiny stuff and tech. Like cars and big buildings, and iphones to hear intelligent people discuss politics on twitter, or if our big brother AMC is worth 1 trillion or 100 trillion dollars. The issue is how much we’re fucking up our planet to get everyone what they want.

**Solution:** Decarbonizing global energy and transport

What do Teslas, and phones, and tech in general need? You guessed it: Pornhub access.

What’s the second thing they need? Metals.

Carbon-free systems will take billions of tons of metals to build. And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires… a fuck ton of metals.

The cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6nxt1szgao71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59ecff508cbc158124a2f45c3bb311aaf239d205

These ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn’t the only thing scarred)

But these little guys, they bleed money. And I mean profusely.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9wncayk1hao71.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c72260ef0f76a9f574a552fbc38b16f77ae1704a

They contain the base metals needed to make **batteries**. Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it’s estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion.

TMC’s main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:

&amp;#x200B;

[subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/zq042yc3hao71.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeff27d132595663f5971a8b4514efe6e32854a3)

It goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.

The NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world’s** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).

To put it into perspective; [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0) is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021.

And $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals.

HOLY MOLY

That’s a lot of rocks.

Their plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they’re looking to recycle the metals from car batteries  and put the metals back into circulation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[base station](https://preview.redd.it/828bw5zchao71.png?width=2646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5a10d5d73b8d1a0804b584bcac7f6eb3d253a3)

&gt;Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.

&amp;#x200B;

But Junkyard-Razor74, don’t we have metals on land that we’re mining? Why yes but back to the planet thing. We’re trying to save it right? Rightttt?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c8bxggw8hao71.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac03abb99a2120f3c2689e9fe3aeb45538094de

Infrastructure, auto industry, transit, power sector, buildings, innovative technologies. They all need metals. And many of them batteries. This is where the metal company is positioning themselves to bank. The future is green 💵 💵 💵 ☘️☘️☘️

&amp;#x200B;

[land mining bad, sea mining good](https://preview.redd.it/h1o64b8hhao71.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a215b20cd8c3da5d0bfa5471a1e2807989e6d1a)

&gt;Using nodules to create EV batteries will generate at least **75% less CO2** than ores from land-based mines.

Cool. So now we’re on the same page. Electric cars have batteries, batteries need metals, TMC make batteries good for planet.

# Part 2. why it doesn’t matter (right now)

Information directly from form [8K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-048261/) dated 9/15/2021.

DeepGreen Metals and Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation (SOAC) completed Their business combination and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker $TMC on Sept 10th, 2021.

In connection with the closing of the transaction, The Metals Company expects to receive approximately **$137.5 million** **in cash** prior to transaction fees, including $27.2 million of proceeds distributed from the SOAC trust account after accounting for redemptions and **$110.3** **million** of proceeds from PIPE investors in the private placement.

SOAC acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital of DeepGreen:

The shareholders and the option holders of DeepGreen became entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for their DeepGreen Common Shares and options to purchase DeepGreen Common Shares, as applicable, an aggregate of **229,162,651 TMC Common Shares** (which includes TMC Common Shares underlying options).

Each Share is automatically convertible into TMC Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

SOAC entered into Subscription Agreements with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of **11,030,000 TMC Common Shares** at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of **$110,300,000** (the “PIPE Financing”).

SOAC also entered into Subscription Agreements for an aggregate of **22,000,000 Common Shares**, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of **$220,000,000** with two investors who defaulted on the Closing Date under the Subscription Agreements. The Company plans to aggressively pursue its available remedies with respect to such investors.

**In summary:** They got cash in the bank. Also, the total number of TMC Common Shares outstanding immediately following the Closing was approximately **224,385,324** comprising

* **203,874,981** TMC Common Shares issued to **DeepGreen shareholders**
* **11,030,000** TMC Common Shares issued in connection with the Closing to the **PIPE Investors** pursuant to the PIPE Financing
* **6,759,000** TMC Common Shares held by the **initial shareholders** (which includes the Sponsor, Rick Gaenzle, Isaac Barchas and Justin Kelly) and…
* **2,721,343** TMC Common Shares held by **public shareholders**, reflecting **redemptions of 27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares.

Here’s the kicker:

**The Sponsor Group Holders and the DeepGreen Holders** (**203,874,981** TMC Common Shares) also **agreed not to effect any sale** or distribution of certain equity securities of the Company held by them **during the period ending on the earlier of (a) 180 days after the Closing**, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) subsequent to the Closing, (x) if the last reported sale price of the TMC Common Shares **equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading days** commencing after the closing.

Can’t sell them until blah blah blah.

**27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares **redeemed**.

**11,030,000** TMC Common Shares offered and sold to the PIPE Investors are currently **locked up**

So you’re telling me that around 3.6 million shares have been shorted… when SUPPOSEDLY the available public float is 2.7 million shares…

What am I missing here, are we all retarded? Did I actually learn how to read?

The short interest data of 3.6 million shares short **seems to be** from when the float was larger, before redemption. Most of them **should’ve** covered. **IF** the short interest is the same then yes, the SI is over 100%+

I don’t even care about the short interest. It can be 30,000 or 3,000,000.

The public fucking float is **2.7 million shares**. According to the SEC filings and the CEO himself. Take a look: [Listen to the first 1 ½ minutes](https://twitter.com/TDANetwork/status/1438917219732312067?s=20).

Someone is buying up $6 calls expiring 10/15. Why deep into the money? Possibly to hedge a short. Or possibly to exercise and get this gamma squeeze going. IDK just speculation. Unusual none the less.

The following day 9/17 we had a buy at $10 per share. The price we needed to stay above. The support came just in time.

**TL,DR:** The Metals Company is developing the world’s largest estimated source of battery metals, with enough nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese to electrify the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet. They do this through innovative technology and deep-sea mining, which is healthier for our planet and lucrative for our pockets in the long term.

How are we retards missing this fundamental important point, the WARRANTS are extremely CHEAP. Why doesn’t anyone squeeze the warrants in order for the smart money to hedge their position with WARRANTS.

A warrant is like an option. In IRNT for example, the price of the stock is 36,5 and the warrant price is 9. With an exercise price of 11,5, if you exercise the warrant would be worth 25 (36,5 - 11,5) dollars. This means, the warrant is priced ridiciously cheap compared to the options. At this point the warrant is not exercisable yet, but this is not gonna take long until those are exercisable ...

In the prospectus (see link below) of IRNT one can find the rules when the warrants will be exercisable:

“We have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A”

“If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.”

Smart money is using the warrants to hedge their positions as these warrants can still be shorted against low stock borrow rate, It is the cheapest way of hedging and they will make a shipload of $$$$.

# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we saw an absolutely massive options volume. As a result, the September options chain is looking primed and ready to go for a push higher.

Here's our current volume and OI trends:

https://preview.redd.it/lhvq192f42o71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5b40521c25144d4837f91c75a26e44d61cd661

And here's the options chain for September as of this morning (taken from [here](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/opad/quote_table)):

https://preview.redd.it/ku4pt71j32o71.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3306484dfe8e93fe6e12886073ac83666772c28c

It looks like a good amount of OI was rolled to higher OTM strikes yesterday. Rather than the highest OI strike being ATM or ITM (which is where it's been since I've been following the stock), its highest OI strike is the highest one available to trade yesterday. If we see OPAD rebound after this pre-market dip, this volume higher up in the options chain could be our rocket fuel for our launch into space. If more people start buying even further OTM calls after that, that's where we could see this pop off and move to a price higher than the highest options strike.

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that we now have strikes up to $40 available to trade. You retards seemingly just pick the highest possible strike to buy, so I'm sure we'll see some huge volume there today.

# Short Squeeze - Short Sellers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some updates on short interest from Ortex I grabbed yesterday:

https://preview.redd.it/izsdf9uy02o71.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12f91bce87fba4cdcf466a656c6b3602b5d4653

Short interest went up from yesterday by almost 14%. At 6.76 million shares short, that would be almost twice the current float of about 3.4 million shares. Cost to borrow also skyrocketed to nearly 300% on average. Days to close is going down as daily volume has been going up.

And here's an update from this morning so far:

https://preview.redd.it/axpwo4rw22o71.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f39454e6b3c07eac57ce919f552d0787882cd7e

Given this update for today, I think we're seeing a significant amount of shorting in pre-market which is what is driving the price down. People **really** don't want this thing getting above $20.

That said, I do think it's possible we saw some covering yesterday. With the huge volume traded, there would have been ample opportunity for existing shorts to close out (likely at a loss) and new shorts to open up positions. However, if this thing rockets off today even those new positions are likely to be screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

# Looking Ahead

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, **I still believe in this play 100%**. Many have messaged me asking for a price target, but that's something I can't give - this play is just too unpredictable. What I can share is that today I am looking for a significant options volume and OI to finish ITM. If we see that, this could continue into next week as market makers need to deliver those shares. I am also setting price levels where I will trim portions of my position to lock in profit (and will constantly be re-evaluating this as the day progresses).

Given the volatility of this stock and the current pre-market moves, I want to take this opportunity to give everyone a reminder to take some profits when you can. Ultimately this trade is all about making money, and you can't do that if you hold forever. As you'll see below, yesterday I already trimmed some of my position in order to take out my cost basis. I also got into this play much earlier than many of you, so keep in mind that the way I'm weighing my risk here is likely much more different than you if you just bought in yesterday.

Straight to the point, we're talking about $DOMA.

$DOMA went public in July this year via a SPAC. It was a shitty merger (*according to the market*) because the redemption rate was 85.5% which is super high (*as shown* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C65RwHVSLOUKkuJaf3RgkeDiuMmhrMMKYncfM7YrF0U/htmlview#gid=0)). 

This left them with a tiny float of just \~5 Million for a company with a market cap of $2.5 Billion! On top of that, they have options which shouldn't even exist for a company that has such a low float (*this is literally a loophole which SEC will probably fix eventually*). 

Now what makes $DOMA interesting is the fact that it's overly shorted. The short interest ratio is **6.6 days**. What that means is that it will take 6.6 days worth of volume for SHORT-ers to cover their position. If they try to do it within a single day, I can totally see the price hitting $25 because of the lack of liquidity in this stock and the amount of Open Interest in option markets. Either way, there's a good chance it can unfold into a gamma squeeze potentially. 

With all that being said, the IV on the options is going to be crazy but it can only get crazier from here.

Also remember they mainly cover the position towards the last 5 minutes of market close. Reason being that there are no margin calls issued before that. If anything, that's when you should expect to see major buying volumes. 

Yesterday it closed at a low price of $7 and it hit $9 during after hours trading with respectable volume of 20,000 shares (*in 1 minute time period*).

Now here's the icing. DOMA has somehow managed to get a price target of $14.00 from JMP Securities and a price target of $11.00 from Citi Group! These analysts know the company more than any of us apes in here. This is another instance of GME like stock being pushed down by the hedgies. 

With some buy volume, the price action would be crazy for all of us to witness.

I've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppfro/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pph9f0/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).

For those, who stayed - enjoy the read!

It all started from my “L'Oreal shampoo commercial”-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!

Buckle up for the TA journey of your life, let’s ~~dive~~ fly in!

Oh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:

&gt;“This is not the financial advice, no.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is just a tribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!”

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, it’s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:

* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,
* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,
* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the thesis should sound something like GME🆙VIX🆙=SP🆘, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, quoting my bet post here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I should recommend  you reading u/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and/or u/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.

There is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...

Let me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.

&amp;#x200B;

# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The value of any stock index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that ""the markets"" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter 'ß' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.

Essentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.

\*\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\*\*

Many of you must have seen -ß posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...

Ladies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:

[GME v SP, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)

What you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout / trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?

&amp;#x200B;

[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https://preview.redd.it/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)

Next, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME🆙SP🆘. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.

Ok, so 🆙🆘 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.

Well, that's why:

[SP, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)

SP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.

In one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don’t know how long.

Man, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!

&amp;#x200B;

# III. Chew it Over with VIX

&amp;#x200B;

Next, let’s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it’s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.

To begin with,

[VIX, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)

The chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.

And who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:

[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https://preview.redd.it/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)

Just one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME’s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the ‘Purple Haze’ resistance (“break to initiate the squeeze”) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME🆙VIX🆙; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?

Oh, and did I mention?

[VIX, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)

During the year and a half, the instrument’s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME🆙VIX🆙SP🆘, quick math, and

[We get an ape’s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \(the Greater\).](https://preview.redd.it/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)

&amp;#x200B;

# IV. This is the tits-jacking part. Achtung! You have been warned!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!

Firstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:

[GME, daily log chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)

The log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)

But wait, there's more! Let's change the viewing ~~tri~~angle:

[GME, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/nii0wtvhf2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29dc68d5034aa1a8258a22dae522f241ab3b196)

Hm, looks familiar. I swear, I must have seen this TA setup before! Oh...

[AMC, daily chart - 4 months old analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/aahe793pf2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce50af7363612d218d3f98ba410416dbc1e3cbdd)

Take a look at beautiful triangular wedge formations at the core of each chart. Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk’s price action after the breakout. \*\* GME: ""Hold my beer"" \*\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.

Butth waaitt, therrz moooore! How about a monthly log chart bullish pennant?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: there is a strong correlational behaviour which goes like GME🆙VIX🆙SP500🆘, and which is evident when you overlay and compare the charts.

$DOMA went public in July this year via a SPAC. It was a shitty merger (*according to the market*) because the redemption rate was 85.5% which is super high (*as shown* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C65RwHVSLOUKkuJaf3RgkeDiuMmhrMMKYncfM7YrF0U/htmlview#gid=0)).

This left them with a tiny float of just \~5 Million for a company with a market cap of $2.5 Billion! On top of that, they have options which shouldn't even exist for a company that has such a low float (*this is literally a loophole which SEC will probably fix eventually*).

Now what makes $DOMA interesting is the fact that it's overly shorted. The short interest ratio is **6.6 days**. What that means is that it will take 6.6 days worth of volume for SHORT-ers to cover their position. If they try to do it within a single day, I can totally see the price hitting $25 because of the lack of liquidity in this stock and the amount of Open Interest in option markets. Either way, there's a good chance it can unfold into a gamma squeeze potentially.

With all that being said, the IV on the options is going to be crazy but it can only get crazier from here.

Also remember they mainly cover the position towards the last 5 minutes of market close. Reason being that there are no margin calls issued before that. If anything, that's when you should expect to see major buying volumes.

Yesterday it closed at a low price of $7 and it hit $9 during after hours trading with respectable volume of 20,000 shares (*in 1 minute time period*).

Now here's the icing. DOMA has  managed to get a price target of $14.00 from analysts and a price target of $11.00 from Citi Group as well just this morning, Friday Sep 17, from Oppenheimer as well! These analysts know the company more than any of us apes in here. This is another instance of GME like stock being pushed down by the hedgies.

With some buy volume, the price action would be crazy for all of us to witness.

**TL;DR**

* LILM shares and calls offer great reward for the risk due to a likely short/gamma squeeze. Monday and Tuesday could see a massive rise in the stock driven by a combination of high short interest, lack of available shares to close shorts, gamma hedging from the massive call sweeps.
* After redemptions, LILM has a higher short interest than Joby did at merger
* Piper Sandler Initiated LILM as Overweight with a PT of $17, leaving 70% upside.

**Disclosure and Disclaimer: Long October 2021 $12.50 strike calls.**

**Background.** LILM is an German electric vertical take-off and landing company (**EVTOL)** which just consummated its merger last week. Long-term investors include Baillie Gifford (one of the largest shareholders of **Tesla**), **Blackrock, Tencent and Palantir.** Lilium also plans to expand to Brazil with a **$1 Billion** purchase order from Azul Airlines. The merger was led by Barry Engle, who was the President of GM North America.

**Analyst Coverage. Piper Sandler** recently initiated **LILM** as **Overweight**, with a price target of $17. This presents us with 70% upside from here just to reach that initial target.

**Redemptions are high enough to cause a short squeeze.** Last Friday, LILM reported a 65% redemption of public shares, resulting in a float of 13.7 million shares. The last exchange-reported short interest was 3.6 million shares, resulting in 27% shares held short. 

Joby Aviation, another eVTOL company which came public via a merger, had redemptions that implied a ***lower*** short interest % of free float than LILM, resulting in a 21% short interest ratio. Joby shares rose from $10.02 to as high as $14.25 the day after the merger closed, despite a float of \~2x that of LILM. 

LILM short interest rose into the last exchange-reported short interest to 5.6m shares.

**The assumed current high short interest in LILM can be supported by both high borrow costs and low availability of shares across brokers.** For example, as of Friday, there were only 19,700 shares available to short on Interactive Brokers. Cost-to-borrow fees were 14% and rates appear to be exploding.

 Some might reference Ortex short interest data, which shows that LILM’s shares short are estimated to have declined into last Friday’s business combination vote. However, it is very clear from backtesting that Ortex data cannot be trusted to have a high level of accuracy in the data it reports.

 **Options flow data indicates that traders are paying attention and market makers will need to be on their toes.** As of today, OI on calls is 14841, with the majority of this sitting in the 10, 12.5 and 15 strikes. Puts have significantly less OI and volume. Below is a Bloomberg chart that shows moneyness (with the stock currently at $10, the 100 is $10 strike, 125 is $12.50 strike and so on) vs. open interest. The size of the bubble represents volume. One can observe that the significant call volume buying has been in the $12.50 and $15 strikes for this week and October. This leads me to believe that any further call volume could require meaningful delta hedging from market makers.

\- Crack price spreads (margin on refined products) show durable, consistent strengthening over the last year

\- One of the pressures on US refiner margin has been low demand in Europe, which has allowed those refiners to export product here. With container shipping prices going parabolic that probably is not going to continue to be viable

\- Demand for refined products is extremely strong in the US, even running ahead of pre-COVID in some segments. Demand increasing in Europe now as well as things continue to normalize

\- There is a very high short interest in this stock, which I think makes it vulnerable to squeeze and rapid price appreciation. The shorts are particularly exposed because of the high dividend yield, making the stock more expensive to hold short positions

yesterday's part 1: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppj6pt/asts_porn_play_with_gamma_squeeze_potentialshort/)

Good Morning!

**TL;DR**

Ticker: ASTS

If we close above **$12.5 today,** **814000 shares** will be exercised which equals almost **70% of average daily volume** triggering a squeeze to **$15** which will cause another squeeze of **727,200 shares** with almost **no resistance** because the **float is extremely small** and the shares available for short has almost **dried** up. **$18+ is not an impossibility TODAY!** 

# SHORTS ARE FUCKED! Only 55K shares available for Shorting Today! (Fintel 26minutes ago)

# $ASTS is really close to the first Milestone of $12.5 which at market close will exercise 593,100 SHARES in an extremely low float. (GAMMA SQUEEEEZE)

# $12.5 Will Boost it to the next milestone of $15 where 727,200 shares will also be exercised at market close if it stays above it. (GAMMA Turbo Boost!)  

A Gamma/Short squeeze is very possible **today** and it's quite simple:

1- Yesterday $ASTS had a volume of 956,348(very low) and the stock went up 4.94%(and 8.8% after market). This indicates how truly small the float is and how easily it could MOON.

2- As I mentioned above, $ASTS is very close to it's Miles stones. At $15, with the strikes of $2.5, $5, $7.5, $10, $12.5, and $15, at close if we remain above $15, The combined exercisable stocks would be **1,541,200 shares!! almost 1.5 times more than yesterdays volume!!! Add to that the dried up ammo of shorts, A run above $15 could continue to $18 and beyond.**

3- ASTS is a one of a kind Gamma squeeze play, because unlike $IRNT and $OPAD, it's not even 50% of it's all time high of **$25.37**. The potential upside is very big.

4- Another unique feature is that It's an undervalued play which has attracted the investment and partnership of industry leaders such as AT&amp;T, American Tower, Vodafone, and Rakuten. **Barclays and Deutsche Bank recently gave it a PT of $29 and $35**, but noted **the upside of bananas was much higher once the technology is validated in scale.**

What I mentioned were my observations for the possibility of a short/gamma squeeze **today.** I am not advocating a pump and dump. I am sharing that **this compelling company which has been shorted AF and the shorts have run out of ammunition.** They cannot artificially keep the stock price down any more via shorting as they only have a handful of shares left to do so.

**Be warned, If ASTS squeezes, it will become very risky during the squeeze, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose or don't partake at all because it's a retarded move.**",wallstreetbets,Update: TODAY $ASTS Porn Play has an extremely high potential of Gamma/Short SQUEEZING!

At the time it was $14.00 and 9/17 $20 calls were something like $0.30 each. Remember my post on WSB? No, you don't. It got deleted. That didn't stop IRNT from hitting $40 in AH and opening the following day at like $26.

How about a stock called TMC? Remember when [I posted about its similar set-up](https://ww.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/pnjll5/tmc_high_gamma_high_short_interest_but_high_iv/) Monday? You don't remember that? Oh, right, I didn't post it to WSB because I didn't want to get banned again. Well, it seems to be doing fine.

Last night, rather than sleep, I decided to spent hours filling out a spreadsheet with every deSPAC I could find (if you're deep in the deSPAC craze, you know the list); complete with the new floats, IV, gamma values, percent of float deltahedged, estimated SI, Utilization, and CTB -- you know... the only things that really matter to us. (It's not like ""fundamentals"" could fit in a spreadsheet column, anyway.)

Now I'm letting off some steam by once again partaking in the lost ancient art form of writing a DD for WSB. This time it's about what I think is best deSPAC play that is currently available for WSB to blindly dump its collective IRNT winnings into: VLTA.

tldr:

* **MARKET CAP IS $2B NO BAN PLS**
* Low IV (currently) -- Make money from the MMs, not from each other.
* High gamma -- Even after Sep options expire.
* Some short interest (\~10% of float) -- but more importantly 0 shares to borrow to keep this dog down. CTB getting ""up there"" at 47%.
* The company does stuff.. not sure what, but I'm sure it's great world-changing stuff. Their name is Volta, so they must have *potential*... get it?
* **The set-up looks suspiciously good, so I might be missing something. Perhaps wait for some wrinkle brain to shit on my thesis here.**

# 0. The Market Cap

I'm not actually salty about being banned; the mods have a tough job sorting through all the bullshit. I mean, just look at the titles of DDs these days... people just put in zero effort. At the time I posted about IRNT, the reported market cap on it varied from source to source due to the fucked up situation with outstanding shares and float. I assume the mods thought I was trying to sneak one by 'em. No hard feelings. I don't blame the mods for erring on the side of caution.

Anyway, this time around **I'm certain VLTA meets the market cap requirements.**

Just ask TDA:

Alright. **$2.0B &gt; $1.5B. Let's move on.**

# 1. The Process

How did I find VLTA? It's simple. I don't have a life and I spent all night making a spreadsheet, running calculations on gamma, and throwing in SI data from Ortex for tickers that look interesting.

Here's a screenshot:

&amp;#x200B;

[Lots of pretty colors. Must be legit.](https://preview.redd.it/lkm05ddun2o71.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe3fc377af5f6779ecb2e230119be1f5e0798b6)

I blurred a lot of the tickers, per market cap rules. (If you're a true deSPAC degen, you'll know where the tickers and float numbers came from.)

What I looked for were tickers with a lot of bright green squares. Most importantly, I want that low IV -- which to me indicates MMs asking to get reamed. Just like momma always says -- Low IV is how 10+ baggers are made.

I was surprised to see that VLTA had the 5th highest current gamma value, behind TMC, OPAD, REDACTED, and IRNT. All of these have seen significant price action lately. Yet, the IV on VLTA was incredibly low... only bested by tickers with higher market caps and non-existent gamma. Wake up, MMs. (Or, again I'm missing some piece of the puzzle here.)

Oh, before you ask about IV -- I'm using 30d ATM IV as my baseline. I compute it myself by interpolating IV between strikes and expirations. In reality, each ticker will have it's own IV skew so don't yell at me when you see the OTM FDs aren't 80% IV.

As for the SI column: some tickers (the gray ones) had bonkers Estimated Short Interest. For these tickers, I used 60% of the On Loan value to estimate the estimated short interest. If you want hopium, upper bound for SI is about 1.6x the gray values.

# 2. The Set-up

To summarize VLTA:

* It's a deSPAC
* With high OI relative to it's new float
* With some short interest (not much)
* But no shares available to borrow
* With sustained bullish order flow
* **And it's IV is priced as though all of the above is not true.**

## deSPAC

It's a deSPAC.

If you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions (but the options don't), so there ends up being a ton of options and not a lot of float, and MMs might not be aware of the change in the float and might think it's easy to buy shares to deltahedge but in reality there isn't a lot of float at all and when they deltahedge they push the price up making things worse for themselves. Same goes for shorts trying to cover.

No, I'm just not going to explain deSPACs to you at all.

In case you're wondering, VLTA completed August 26th with a 70% redemption rate. That's a lot lower than 90%+ we see with the IRNT, OPAD, TMC wonderkids.  So beware, a lower redemption rate means shareholders were more confident in Volta -- it might actually not be a completely shitty company.

## OI relative to float

A lot of people are going to shit on VLTA because it has a ""high float"" of 10,277,713 shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to IRNT (\~1.3m), TMC (\~2.7m), OPAD (\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But there's also **a significant amount of OI** to make up for.

What really matters for gamma is the *ratio* of OI to float.

So let's take a looksee at the 'ole deltaflux table:

## DeltaFlux / Gamma

Once again, I'll throw out this disclaimer about deltaflux tables: **They are an approximation, and they make incorrect assumptions**.

Some assumptions the table makes that make it inaccurate:

* It assumes MMs deltahedge via black scholes model
* Continuously and completely
* Based on the options' IVs
* For every single option in the chain

Pretty much all of those assumptions are false. Just because the table says the net delta is X% of float *does not* mean ""MMs must buy this many shares or else they fuk!!"". **The table is meant to present values that are useful to compare** ***across time*** **and** ***across tickers*****.**

Ok. Let's continue:

I like to represent gamma by ""how many shares need to be deltahedged (as a percentage of float) per a 1% movement in price"". A reminder that I consider values over 0.30% to be abnormally high. 1.00%+ is insane. We're at around 0.85%, which is fairly juicy, and things look good all the way through to $20.

I cannot recall ever seeing gamma values this high with IVs this low. If I saw this ramp and had to guess at what the 30d ATM IV would be, I'd guess at least 140%. We're sitting at 90%. **This makes me think I am missing something -- so if there's a piece to this puzzle I'm missing, let me know.**

Higher IV, lower gamma.

**Two last bits of info for everyone:**

1. High gamma does not guarantee a gamma squeeze. A squeeze implies a runaway effect. What we want here is *momentum*. Think of a puck gliding on ice. High gamma = less friction.
2. High gamma makes it easy to go up, but it also makes it easy to go down. Just like the puck gliding on ice. Easy to slide one way, easy to slide the other.

## Short Interest and Utilization

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2sowjzizn2o71.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f924e9b6b0c2b529bc791a8036a79d92ec51856

Ortex doesn't estimate SI for this one, but they do have the amount On Loan. It's 1,664,307, or 16.19 % float. That's the upper bound -- the real SI is generally lower than the amount that Ortex reports On Loan. If I had to guess, about 60% of it, so around 1m shares shorted, which is about 10% of float. Not a big story here.

Also of note is the *rising* value of the On Loan average age. It's going up -- which means that most shares borrowed were done so in the past. Think of it this way: if older loans were closed and new ones opened, the average age would go down.

The average age is 18 days, which is around Aug 30, when share price was $10.00. So to the extent that there are shorts, they're underwater just a bit.

SI isn't super compelling. What's more encouraging, to me, is the Utilization pegged near 100%, and CTB in high double digits. This means there are no shares to short, and when there are, they are expensive. This is generally good news when you want the stock to go up.

## Order Flow

The past several days have seen an influx of buyers, and I don't know where exactly they are coming from. I don't find very many mentions of this ticker on Reddit. Well, I did find [one post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp0fu2/vlta_look_at_me_over_here_fomo_just_want_to_be/). As of now, I'm the only upvote. I just left a comment.

Here's the orderflow, per MarketChameleon:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zxopg4d0o2o71.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a39ca7a556a9c7a88e549105b68b2d911482f4e4

Bullish enough for me.

## The Implied Vol

**Here's the part I don't understand.**  Given all of the above, how is it that MMs did not ramp up IV on this deSPAC like they did on all others?

VLTA 10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \~100% IV right now. That seems pretty low to me. Even further OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \~126%.

According to MarketChameleon, which does some weighted averaging type of stuff across strikes and expirations, the 30d IV to be 91%.

For comparison, here are the *pre-jump* 30d IVs of some famous deSPACs:

* IRNT (Sep 1): 127%
* IPOD (Sep 10): 134%
* TMC (Sep 14): 178%
* VLTA (now): 91%

I'm not sure why this is, but I'll take a bargain when I see one.

## Other

VLTA is currently on the threshold securities list. I don't really think carries a lot of weight, but it's worth noting.

# 3. The Play

Alright, I assume you saw a really long DD with pretty pictures and tables and just want to throw money into something.

## Risks/Rewards

Let me first tell you the risks:

* There is no real gamma. Perhaps all the OI is spreads. Or covered calls.
* MMs are anticipating for this (despite the low IV signifying otherwise). Instead of milking them, we're circle jerking one another while playing hot-potato-options until everyone gets bored.
* **I could be completely off about the float or some other mechanic, like PIPE shares unlocking or something.** To the best of my knowledge, this thing has just been sitting quietly under the radar since redemption... aside from the run-up.

And here are the rewards:

* MMs, for some reason, overestimated the float. The buy-in is relentless, and they decide it best to do one or both: a) buy back expensive calls, or b) bite the bullet and accumulate shares, pushing prices up.
* IV going from X% to 300%.
* That hole in yourself you feel for not buying/holding IRNT, OPAD, TMC, etc -- this can provide closure. (Or it can be salt.)

## My Positions

* October calls. $12.50, $15, $17.50.

## When to sell

Look, I have no idea what happens here, and when it happens. I see a good set-up, and I see a deSPAC frenzy all around me, so I think this is a good bet.

**What I will recommend, however, is to keep a very close eye on the IV.** Regardless of price, IV roughly tells you how much ""acceleration"" is priced in. If you're holding an option and the IV jumps up, you need to ask yourself:  will interest in this stock and/or share price accelerate or decelerate? Will inflows continue or reverse? As IV goes up, the margin of error in your judgement decreases -- small errors will cost you bigly, as IV is *generally* correlated to actual volatility.

At which IV and/or price to sell at is a judgement you need to make for yourself based on whatever it is you do, and the risk you can tolerate. It can be TA, gauging sentiment, momentum, technicals (float, gamma, etc), or you just feel it in your plums.

For me, personally, I'm a little bitch and will probably be out at around 300% IV, just like I was with all the other deSPACs. I have faith gamma pushes this upwards, but at some point, the MMs are milked and it becomes a game of hot-potato.

At the time it was $14.00 and 9/17 $20 calls were something like $0.30 each. Remember my post on WSB? No, you don't. It got deleted. That didn't stop IRNT from hitting $40 in AH and opening the following day at like $26.

How about a stock called TMC? Remember when [I posted about its similar set-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/pnjll5/tmc_high_gamma_high_short_interest_but_high_iv/) Monday? You don't remember that? Oh, right, I didn't post it to WSB because I didn't want to get banned again. Well, it seems to be doing fine.

Last night, rather than sleep, I decided to spent hours filling out a spreadsheet with every deSPAC I could find (if you're deep in the deSPAC craze, you know the list); complete with the new floats, IV, gamma values, percent of float deltahedged, estimated SI, Utilization, and CTB -- you know... the only things that really matter to us. (It's not like ""fundamentals"" could fit in a spreadsheet column, anyway.)

Now I'm letting off some steam by once again partaking in the lost ancient art form of writing a DD for WSB. This time it's about what I think is best deSPAC play that is currently available for WSB to blindly dump its collective IRNT winnings into: VLTA.

tldr:

* **MARKET CAP IS $2B NO BAN PLS**
* Low IV (currently) -- Make money from the MMs, not from each other.
* High gamma -- Even after Sep options expire.
* Some short interest (\~10% of float) -- but more importantly 0 shares to borrow to keep this dog down. CTB getting ""up there"" at 47%.
* The company does stuff.. not sure what, but I'm sure it's great world-changing stuff. Their name is Volta, so they must have *potential*... get it?
* **The set-up looks suspiciously good, so I might be missing something. Perhaps wait for some wrinkle brain to shit on my thesis here.**

# 0. The Market Cap

I'm not actually salty about being banned; the mods have a tough job sorting through all the bullshit. I mean, just look at the titles of DDs these days... people just put in zero effort. At the time I posted about IRNT, the reported market cap on it varied from source to source due to the fucked up situation with outstanding shares and float. I assume the mods thought I was trying to sneak one by 'em. No hard feelings. I don't blame the mods for erring on the side of caution.

Anyway, this time around **I'm certain VLTA meets the market cap requirements.**

Just ask TDA:

Alright. $2.0B &gt; $1.5B. Let's move on.

# 1. The Process

How did I find VLTA? It's simple. I don't have a life and I spent all night making a spreadsheet, running calculations on gamma, and throwing in SI data from Ortex for tickers that look interesting.

Here's a screenshot:

&amp;#x200B;

[Lots of pretty colors. Must be legit.](https://preview.redd.it/8f39xl4xo2o71.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3094fd899041cbe76974ba16a5215aae82349781)

I blurred a lot of the tickers, per market cap rules. (If you're a true deSPAC degen, you'll know where the tickers and float numbers came from.)

What I looked for were tickers with a lot of bright green squares. Most importantly, I want that low IV -- which to me indicates MMs asking to get reamed. Just like momma always says -- Low IV is how 10+ baggers are made.

I was surprised to see that VLTA had the 5th highest current gamma value, behind TMC, OPAD, REDACTED, and IRNT. All of these have seen significant price action lately. Yet, the IV on VLTA was incredibly low... only bested by tickers with higher market caps and non-existent gamma. Wake up, MMs. (Or, again I'm missing some piece of the puzzle here.)

Oh, before you ask about IV -- I'm using 30d ATM IV as my baseline. I compute it myself by interpolating IV between strikes and expirations. In reality, each ticker will have it's own IV skew so don't yell at me when you see the OTM FDs aren't 80% IV.

As for the SI column: some tickers (the gray ones) had bonkers Estimated Short Interest. For these tickers, I used 60% of the On Loan value to estimate the estimated short interest. If you want hopium, upper bound for SI is about 1.6x the gray values.

# 2. The Set-up

To summarize VLTA:

* It's a deSPAC
* With high OI relative to it's new float
* With some short interest (not much)
* But no shares available to borrow
* With sustained bullish order flow
* **And it's IV is priced as though all of the above is not true.**

## deSPAC

It's a deSPAC.

If you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions (but the options don't), so there ends up being a ton of options and not a lot of float, and MMs might not be aware of the change in the float and might think it's easy to buy shares to deltahedge but in reality there isn't a lot of float at all and when they deltahedge they push the price up making things worse for themselves. Same goes for shorts trying to cover.

No, I'm just not going to explain deSPACs to you at all.

In case you're wondering, VLTA completed August 26th with a 70% redemption rate. That's a lot lower than 90%+ we see with the IRNT, OPAD, TMC wonderkids.  So beware, a lower redemption rate means shareholders were more confident in Volta -- it might actually not be a completely shitty company.

## OI relative to float

A lot of people are going to shit on VLTA because it has a ""high float"" of 10,277,713 shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to IRNT (\~1.3m), TMC (\~2.7m), OPAD (\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But there's also **a significant amount of OI** to make up for.

What really matters for gamma is the *ratio* of OI to float.

So let's take a looksee at the 'ole deltaflux table:

## DeltaFlux / Gamma

Once again, I'll throw out this disclaimer about deltaflux tables: **They are an approximation, and they make incorrect assumptions**.

Some assumptions the table makes that make it inaccurate:

* It assumes MMs deltahedge via black scholes model
* Continuously and completely
* Based on the options' IVs
* For every single option in the chain

Pretty much all of those assumptions are false. Just because the table says the net delta is X% of float *does not* mean ""MMs must buy this many shares or else they fuk!!"". **The table is meant to present values that are useful to compare** ***across time*** **and** ***across tickers*****.**

Ok. Let's continue:

I like to represent gamma by ""how many shares need to be deltahedged (as a percentage of float) per a 1% movement in price"". A reminder that I consider values over 0.30% to be abnormally high. 1.00%+ is insane. We're at around 0.85%, which is fairly juicy, and things look good all the way through to $20.

I cannot recall ever seeing gamma values this high with IVs this low. If I saw this ramp and had to guess at what the 30d ATM IV would be, I'd guess at least 140%. We're sitting at 90%. **This makes me think I am missing something -- so if there's a piece to this puzzle I'm missing, let me know.**

Higher IV, lower gamma.

**Two last bits of info for everyone:**

1. High gamma does not guarantee a gamma squeeze. A squeeze implies a runaway effect. What we want here is *momentum*. Think of a puck gliding on ice. High gamma = less friction.
2. High gamma makes it easy to go up, but it also makes it easy to go down. Just like the puck gliding on ice. Easy to slide one way, easy to slide the other.

## Short Interest and Utilization

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k32ay110p2o71.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39cd6c0b8c0f67242e10eb88e805486577a91255

Ortex doesn't estimate SI for this one, but they do have the amount On Loan. It's 1,664,307, or 16.19 % float. That's the upper bound -- the real SI is generally lower than the amount that Ortex reports On Loan. If I had to guess, about 60% of it, so around 1m shares shorted, which is about 10% of float. Not a big story here.

Also of note is the *rising* value of the On Loan average age. It's going up -- which means that most shares borrowed were done so in the past. Think of it this way: if older loans were closed and new ones opened, the average age would go down.

The average age is 18 days, which is around Aug 30, when share price was $10.00. So to the extent that there are shorts, they're underwater just a bit.

SI isn't super compelling. What's more encouraging, to me, is the Utilization pegged near 100%, and CTB in high double digits. This means there are no shares to short, and when there are, they are expensive. This is generally good news when you want the stock to go up.

## Order Flow

The past several days have seen an influx of buyers, and I don't know where exactly they are coming from. I don't find very many mentions of this ticker on Reddit. Well, I did find [one post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp0fu2/vlta_look_at_me_over_here_fomo_just_want_to_be/). As of now, I'm the only upvote. I just left a comment.

Here's the orderflow, per MarketChameleon:

&amp;#x200B;

Bullish enough for me.

## The Implied Vol

**Here's the part I don't understand.**  Given all of the above, how is it that MMs did not ramp up IV on this deSPAC like they did on all others?

VLTA 10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \~100% IV right now. That seems pretty low to me. Even further OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \~126%.

According to MarketChameleon, which does some weighted averaging type of stuff across strikes and expirations, the 30d IV to be 91%.

For comparison, here are the *pre-jump* 30d IVs of some famous deSPACs:

* IRNT (Sep 1): 127%
* IPOD (Sep 10): 134%
* TMC (Sep 14): 178%
* VLTA (now): 91%

I'm not sure why this is, but I'll take a bargain when I see one.

## Other

VLTA is currently on the threshold securities list. I don't really think carries a lot of weight, but it's worth noting.

# 3. The Play

Alright, I assume you saw a really long DD with pretty pictures and tables and just want to throw money into something.

## Risks/Rewards

Let me first tell you the risks:

* There is no real gamma. Perhaps all the OI is spreads. Or covered calls.
* MMs are anticipating for this (despite the low IV signifying otherwise). Instead of milking them, we're circle jerking one another while playing hot-potato-options until everyone gets bored.
* **I could be completely off about the float or some other mechanic, like PIPE shares unlocking or something.** To the best of my knowledge, this thing has just been sitting quietly under the radar since redemption... aside from the run-up.

And here are the rewards:

* MMs, for some reason, overestimated the float. The buy-in is relentless, and they decide it best to do one or both: a) buy back expensive calls, or b) bite the bullet and accumulate shares, pushing prices up.
* IV going from X% to 300%.
* That hole in yourself you feel for not buying/holding IRNT, OPAD, TMC, etc -- this can provide closure. (Or it can be salt.)

## What to buy

* October calls.
* Shares

## When to sell

Look, I have no idea what happens here, and when it happens. I see a good set-up, and I see a deSPAC frenzy all around me, so I think this is a good bet.

**What I will recommend, however, is to keep a very close eye on the IV.** Regardless of price, IV roughly tells you how much ""acceleration"" is priced in. If you're holding an option and the IV jumps up, you need to ask yourself:  will interest in this stock and/or share price accelerate or decelerate? Will inflows continue or reverse? As IV goes up, the margin of error in your judgement decreases -- small errors will cost you bigly, as IV is *generally* correlated to actual volatility.

At which IV and/or price to sell at is a judgement you need to make for yourself based on whatever it is you do, and the risk you can tolerate. It can be TA, gauging sentiment, momentum, technicals (float, gamma, etc), or you just feel it in your plums.

For me, personally, I'm a little bitch and will probably be out at around 300% IV, just like I was with all the other deSPACs. I have faith gamma pushes this upwards, but at some point, the MMs are milked and it becomes a game of hot-potato. Not for me.

As we've learned from Wu Tang Financial, it is important to diversify your bonds. This applies to everyone, regardless of your race, religion, creed, gender, bull or gay bear.

So there's nothing wrong with buying into IRNT.

I am simply here to drop the simple DD on TMC. You with me?

1. It has a positive EPS. Unlike every other SPAC, post-SPAC tech/pharma/EV stonk.

2. It has a boomer level P/E ratio. Even with a 100% rally, it's P/E is still criminally low in todays market.

3. It has only 30 million shares available. Which are broken down into:

- 76% existing shareholder equity roll over (225m shares)
- 12% SPAC and founder shares (30m shares)
- 11% PIPE investors (33m shares)

Those numbers don't add up do they? That's because of the lockups &amp; timing.

As of today there are only 30m shares the markets IN TOTAL. That means market makers to private investors or investment funds etc.

ALL of the other shares are LOCKED UP and not available to be traded on the market. They will be made available by The Metals Company in 8 traches if the price of the stonk manages to trade above the tranche strike for 20 of 30 days.

these are:

- 15 strike -&gt; issue 5m shares (we are here, but we haven't hit 20 days yet)
- 25 strike -&gt; issue 10m shares
- 35 strike -&gt; issue 10m shares
- 50 strike -&gt; issue 20.5m shares
- 75 strike -&gt; issue 20m shares
- 100 strike -&gt; issue 25m shares
- 200 strike -&gt; issue 25m shares

What this means is that their share dilution is PRE-DETERMINED across a really long time. In a perfect scenario, we need 20 days above each strike * 8 tranches = 160 trading days. Never gonna happen.

What this also means is that there's literally only 30m shares available for the next 3 weeks at MINIMUM. and there is absolutely nothing that market makers can do to get more shares.

This isn't a SHORT SQUEEZE. Because no retard would have risked shorting a company with only 30m shares and the ridiculous tranche based stonk issuance.

This is a GAMMA level squeeze of the market makers.

There is not enough shares to go around, and if we exceed $15 for next 20 trading days straight, the dilution is only 16.78%. It would only bring TMC up to 35m shares. Then the clock starts ticking for 20 more trading days.

As I sit here typing this OPAD is up 34% premarket, trading above $16, and entering low earth orbit. However, we're still just getting started. How much higher do you think this fucker can go? I want to see if we can reach our IRNT brethren at Alpha Centauri.

I want to share a couple updates on where we currently stand, as well as address a common question I have gotten - how long do we have for this to ""play out""? This post will likely be significantly less fun than the last one as I have to spend a bunch of time explaining SEC filings to answer that ""timeline"" question for you dumbasses who won't read the filings yourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

# Timeline

&amp;#x200B;

First, the ""timeline"" question. Remember that this whole situation has arisen because OPAD has an abnormally low float right now and yet you're still able to buy retardedly OTM options on it. So, this situation lasts until that float increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last several weeks I've been reading through OPAD's filings with the SEC, and as far as I can tell there are three main ways the float can increase at this point. **So, for those of you who actually care about the timing of this and aren't just blindly following others while you YOLO your entire account, here's what to watch out for. I assume most of you WSB retards will just skip this part though.**

&amp;#x200B;

**PIPE shares:**

PIPE stands for ""Private Investment in Public Equity"". During the SPAC process, OPAD raised $200,000,000 through private investments to help fund the merger. These private investors were awarded 20 million shares, and these investors will eventually be able to trade these shares on the open market. However, before they can do that OPAD needs to register these shares with the SEC. According to OPAD's merger agreement, OPAD needs to complete the initial filing (called an ""S-1"") within 30 days of completion of the merger (which happened on September 2). Even after the S-1 is filed, the SEC still needs to review and approve the filing before these PIPE shares can be traded. The initial filing of the S-1 and the SEC's review usually take a couple weeks each, so we're likely looking at late September/early October before these PIPE shares enter the float. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Existing OPAD investors' lock-up period ends:**

There is a lock-up period for existing shareholders of OPAD prior to the merger (such as company executives). These shareholders cannot sell their stock for the 180 days following the completion of the merger (which happened on September 2). There are a couple situations are exceptions to that which would allow a portion of these shares to be traded before 180 days, but these are unlikely to happen before the PIPE shares can be traded:

1. 33% of these shares can be traded if OPAD trades at $12.50 or above for 20 trading days within any 30 day period that occurs at least 30 days following the closing of the merger
2. An additional 50% of these shares can be traded if OPAD trades at $15 or above for 20 trading days within any 30 day period that occurs at least 30 days following the closing of the merger

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercising of warrants:**

Warrants are instruments that behave very similar to options. A single warrant, if exercised, allows you to buy a single stock for $11.50. These warrants trade on the market as OPAD.WS. As these warrants are exercised and converted to stock, more stock enters the float.

&amp;#x200B;

These warrants cannot be exercised until the later of two dates:

1. 30 days after the completion of OPAD's merger (30 days after September 2).
2. 12 months after SPNV's IPO. SPNV was the SPAC that merged with Offerpad, and IPO'd on October 23, 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum it up, there are three times the float can increase:

1. PIPE shares can be traded - likely to happen late September/early October
2. Existing OPAD shareholders can trade their shares - unlikely to happen before PIPE shares start trading
3. Warrants can be exercised on October 23 - PIPE shares are likely to start trading before this

&amp;#x200B;

I am continuing to read through these filings to look for anything I may be missing, but for now it looks like the PIPE unlocking is the likely first catalyst for increasing the float.

&amp;#x200B;

**Options Expiration:**

The other thing I will add on the timeline is that I think these next few days, and possibly even heading into early next week, are where we will see the majority of the craziness. This is because of all of the September options expiring this Friday. These options have the biggest impact on the number of shares that market makers need to buy to hedge because they're super close to expiration. **Since we're close to expiration, in the next few days we may speedrun what took IRNT a couple weeks to do if options volume continues to increase and stock volume increases.** That said, the October expiration options chain looks pretty juicy too - if people keep buying shit tons of options even after this week there's still a chance this could continue into next week and beyond until the PIPE shares start trading.

# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Still Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you retards really fucking did it. I said in my post yesterday that we'd be reaching almost 100% of the float required to be hedged by market makers around $16. In other words, at $16 market makers would need to buy 100% of the float to hedge against the calls they're selling to you. After you retards didn't read my DD and just went and bought a shit ton of OTM calls, that bar became slightly lower due to the additional delta (i.e., hedging) from those additional calls. The increase in OTM calls also likely means that if this thing gets running it could be propelled into the stratosphere from the hedging of these calls.

https://preview.redd.it/72abinum7vn71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=853fb7b56208b7b98adcad6b658b6e6307dbab8f

As a result of the additional calls and the price increase, at close yesterday we were at just about 80% of the float that theoretically should be hedged by market makers. Pre-market action this morning would put us over 100%. As more calls are bought and if the price continues to moon market makers will need to hedge more and more shares, propelling this even higher.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it looks like November calls will start trading today. These will have less impact on market makers' hedging than nearer dated expirations, so I will be watching closely to see what the volume and open interest looks like after today. Also, if you read through the timeline section above, you'll see that this expiration is likely too far out as the float will have increased by then.

&amp;#x200B;

# Short Interest Update - Short Sellers Still Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, here are some updates from Ortex showing yesterday's activity:

https://preview.redd.it/empc0ipr5vn71.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ec7719410575e648b5e870b79e375d7171324cf

That's right--short interest increased again yesterday to 5.94 million shares.  This puts short interest at 175% of the float. Beyond that:

* Utilization is still 98.51%
* Cost to borrow increased to 67.14%
* Days to cover is still 1.4 days (this went down slightly since the average volume used to calculate it increased)

&amp;#x200B;

As OPAD starts to reach all time highs, the short positions of these short sellers will start to turn against them. Estimated short interest increased my millions of shares from Friday to Monday, and those shorts would have opened their positions when OPAD was only trading $9.41-11.79 . Even the shorts who opened their positions at the peak last Thursday will see their positions back at break even if this morning's pre-market action holds. If shorts start to get margin called, that could propel this even higher.

&amp;#x200B;

# Looking Ahead

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, positions update. Yes, I'm still in all of my positions after yesterday. OPAD positions are +$426,213.75 as of yesterday close.

This is just getting started. OPAD, IRNT, and TMC are all popping off together pre-market--someone, somewhere, is bound to be majorly fucked by what we are about to see.

&amp;#x200B;

As I sit here typing this OPAD is up 34% premarket, trading above $16, and entering low earth orbit. However, we're still just getting started. How much higher do you think this fucker can go? I want to see if we can reach our IRNT brethren at Alpha Centauri.

https://preview.redd.it/tnjwegpg9vn71.png?width=299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e55196d94a0b8c1447b3935f4c9cab7c8e2d1120

I want to share a couple updates on where we currently stand, as well as address a common question I have gotten - how long do we have for this to ""play out""? This post will likely be significantly less fun than the last one as I have to spend a bunch of time explaining SEC filings to answer that ""timeline"" question for you dumbasses who won't read the filings yourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

# Timeline

&amp;#x200B;

First, the ""timeline"" question. Remember that this whole situation has arisen because OPAD has an abnormally low float right now and yet you're still able to buy retardedly OTM options on it. So, this situation lasts until that float increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last several weeks I've been reading through OPAD's filings with the SEC, and as far as I can tell there are three main ways the float can increase at this point. **So, for those of you who actually care about the timing of this and aren't just blindly following others while you YOLO your entire account, here's what to watch out for. I assume most of you WSB retards will just skip this part though.**

&amp;#x200B;

**PIPE shares:**

PIPE stands for ""Private Investment in Public Equity"". During the SPAC process, OPAD raised $200,000,000 through private investments to help fund the merger. These private investors were awarded 20 million shares, and these investors will eventually be able to trade these shares on the open market. However, before they can do that OPAD needs to register these shares with the SEC. According to OPAD's merger agreement, OPAD needs to complete the initial filing (called an ""S-1"") within 30 days of completion of the merger (which happened on September 2). Even after the S-1 is filed, the SEC still needs to review and approve the filing before these PIPE shares can be traded. The initial filing of the S-1 and the SEC's review usually take a couple weeks each, so we're likely looking at late September/early October before these PIPE shares enter the float.

&amp;#x200B;

**Existing OPAD investors' lock-up period ends:**

There is a lock-up period for existing shareholders of OPAD prior to the merger (such as company executives). These shareholders cannot sell their stock for the 180 days following the completion of the merger (which happened on September 2). There are a couple situations are exceptions to that which would allow a portion of these shares to be traded before 180 days, but these are unlikely to happen before the PIPE shares can be traded:

1. 33% of these shares can be traded if OPAD trades at $12.50 or above for 20 trading days within any 30 day period that occurs at least 30 days following the closing of the merger
2. An additional 50% of these shares can be traded if OPAD trades at $15 or above for 20 trading days within any 30 day period that occurs at least 30 days following the closing of the merger

&amp;#x200B;

**Exercising of warrants:**

Warrants are instruments that behave very similar to options. A single warrant, if exercised, allows you to buy a single stock for $11.50. These warrants trade on the market as OPAD.WS. As these warrants are exercised and converted to stock, more stock enters the float.

These warrants cannot be exercised until the later of two dates:

1. 30 days after the completion of OPAD's merger (30 days after September 2).
2. 12 months after their original IPO (pre-Offerpad merger). They IPO'd on October 23, 2020.

To sum it up, there are three times the float can increase:

1. PIPE shares can be traded - likely to happen late September/early October
2. Existing OPAD shareholders can trade their shares - unlikely to happen before PIPE shares start trading
3. Warrants can be exercised on October 23 - PIPE shares are likely to start trading before this

I am continuing to read through these filings to look for anything I may be missing, but for now it looks like the PIPE unlocking is the likely first catalyst for increasing the float.

&amp;#x200B;

**Options Expiration:**

The other thing I will add on the timeline is that I think these next few days, and possibly even heading into early next week, are where we will see the majority of the craziness. This is because of all of the September options expiring this Friday. These options have the biggest impact on the number of shares that market makers need to buy to hedge because they're super close to expiration. **Since we're close to expiration, in the next few days we may speedrun what took IRNT a couple weeks to do if options volume continues to increase and stock volume increases.** That said, the October expiration options chain looks pretty juicy too - if people keep buying shit tons of options even after this week there's still a chance this could continue into next week and beyond until the PIPE shares start trading.

I'm sure many option holders will opt for cashing out instead of taking delivery, but surely some option writers will be pressured to buy shares as their deltas go deeply negative. I'm also basing this line of thinking on low available to borrow statistics that plummeted yesterday (over 2M shares to 350K) as well as failure-to-deliver data analysis:

SmileDirectClub - Failures to Deliver last month:

8/01 -  39,493 when price was $7.06

8/03 -       900 when price was $7.23

8/09 -  64,769 when price was $6.83

**8/10 -       881 when price was $6.70**

8/11 - 167,590 when price was $5.08

**8/12 1,557,285 when price was $5.33**

8/13   507,667 when price was $5.20

8/16 - 491,514 when price was $5.03

8/19 - 225,572 when price was $4.83

8/20 -     1,868 when price was $4.69

**8/24 - 424,531 when price was $4.89**

**8/31 -     3,295 when price was $5.34**

There is definitely a spike in failures to deliver between 8/11 and 8/13. That is a day after $SDC went from $7 to $5.08. It started climbing back up to close at $5.33 the day before the FTD spike to 1,557,285 shares. 

Given it can take up to 3 days for trades to settle (require delivery), to me it looks like traders shorted 1.5M shares without actually borrowing them on 8/10 in order to overwhelm any buyers and crush the share price, then covered 1M of them on 8/11.

**I would welcome anyone else's thoughts on what happened there, at the end of the month, and what may be happening this week.** Knowing the current failure to deliver statistics sure would go a long way towards knowing whether shorts are getting trapped here and resorting to what seem to be tactics of shorting without immediate delivery of shares.",wallstreetbets,$SDC Gamma Squeeze Potential - 3.7M shares to deliver above $6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppdkjj/sdc_gamma_squeeze_potential_37m_shares_to_deliver/

My reasons to YOLO on $LILM (Lilium). I see so much potential. Am I missing something?

1. First mover advantage on regulation (FAA, EASA) and commercial availability. Solid plans for starting commercial flights in 2024. Already sold $1 Billion worth of aircrafts.
2. Designed to overcome barriers for adoption. The main barriers for eVTOL projects and reasons they never took off are: battery technology, noise in urban areas, cost-per-mile, capacity scalability. The design was engineered to overcome exactly these barriers.
3. Access to short and long distance routes with 155 miles range
4. Well-funded and competent R&amp;D: Ducted Electric Vectored Thrust (DEVT) major advantages over open propeller eVTOL, Lower noise, lower vibration (smoother ride), Safer (blade loss containment), Larger aircraft with more payload, Scalable (higher revenue potential per jet)
5. Compliant with current FAA regulations
6. Ability to scale technology for higher capacity planes without larger wingspan or higher noise. Current designs are 5 and 7 seat planes, but could be up to 16 passengers in the future with same wingspan. Competitor eVTOL companies can't make larger passenger aircrafts without substantially increasing wingspan, making it impossible to land in most city centers.
7. Lilium was just listed on NASDAQ through a merger with Qell Acquisition Corp. (SPAC), therefore they are well funded to continue development of technology and partnerships.
8. If you care, Elon Musk endorsed the aircraft propeller design.

Tried to keep it short as I know you dyslexicks degenerates don't like to read.

My reasons to YOLO on $LILM (Lilium). I see so much potential. Am I missing something?

1. First mover advantage on regulation (FAA, EASA) and commercial availability. Solid plans for starting commercial flights in 2024. Already sold $1 Billion worth of aircrafts.
2. Designed to overcome barriers for adoption. The main barriers for eVTOL projects and reasons they never took off are: battery technology, noise in urban areas, cost-per-mile, capacity scalability. The design was engineered to overcome exactly these barriers.
3. Access to short and long distance routes with 155 miles range
4. Well-funded and competent R&amp;D: Ducted Electric Vectored Thrust (DEVT) major advantages over open propeller eVTOL, Lower noise, lower vibration (smoother ride), Safer (blade loss containment), Larger aircraft with more payload, Scalable (higher revenue potential per jet)
5. Compliant with current FAA regulations
6. Ability to scale technology for higher capacity planes without larger wingspan or higher noise. Current designs are 5 and 7 seat planes, but could be up to 16 passengers in the future with same wingspan. Competitor eVTOL companies can't make larger passenger aircrafts without substantially increasing wingspan, making it impossible to land in most city centers.
7. Lilium was just listed on NASDAQ through a merger, therefore they are well funded to continue development of technology and partnerships.
8. If you care, Elon Musk endorsed the aircraft propeller design.

$YANG is a beautiful ETF that is 3x the inverse of China. Like the great Bill Hwang, I have learned a lot about leverage and how to properly use it to amplify my returns. Just a direct China inverse ETF is boring. For me to become rich, I need to add leverage, and $YANG is the perfect ETF for that goal. On top of that, I will be buying YANG 65 calls for January, the furthest OTM calls available. YANG 65 calls can create a gamma squeeze in the event China has a total and rapid collapse.

Chinese stocks have been declining this entire year, and still have a long way to go. Cathie 😰 has sold her China stocks, mentioning that she is done dealing with Xi‘s rugpulls and navigating the uncertainties of the CCP. The CCP makes China common stocks look like options.

# Evergrande bonds are like SPY 0 DTE puts

Just like how SPY 0 DTE puts always go to $0 because SPY only goes up, buying Evergrande bonds is nearly identical. Many of Evergrande’s face value bonds have declined 60-80%, with yields [yields rising from 9% to 1,100%!](https://www.bondsupermart.com/bsm/bond-factsheet/XS1982036961) As Evergrande defaults on bonds, investors lose billions of dollars. This will trickle to other companies as there will be less capital to invest elsewhere.

# If Evergrande collapses, it will take China’s real estate market with it

Evergrande is the second best real estate developer in China. #2! This is like Microsoft saying they are filing for bankruptcy. Real Estate makes up over 30% of China’s GDP. Many people invest their entire life savings, parents money, and borrowed money into their home. If real estate collapses, the rest of China’s consumption will go down with it. [Evergrande poses massive systemic risk to China’s economy.](https://www.reuters.com/business/how-china-evergrandes-debt-troubles-pose-systemic-risk-2021-09-14/) This is a massive domino effect that will cause a decline. Lending will be restricted, further slowing growth as China’s growth is fueled by debt, not consumption, which is not a sustainable path forward. When China stops allowing new debt to be issued, growth will decline rapidly and be unstoppable.

# China’s Economy is slowing or declining

If you trust the CCP’s numbers, then Chinas economy is slowing. If you don’t trust the CCP numbers, then China’s economy is declining.

# Background

First, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an [iBuyer](https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/what-is-an-ibuyer) company with a current market cap of 2.636B.

https://preview.redd.it/e4g6s6siamn71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3292896c840518ad8dca8c86fd086e423a0e25db

An iBuyer is basically a company that uses  their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Offerpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT -  a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.

[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/c0fwvvokamn71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d5bfd15c519bb5e2dd2d9f5920ed174aa9dec8)

As a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on /r/WSB in the first place? Go back to /r/investing and your 3 fund portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).

[Closed 9\/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9\/7 at $10.09. On 9\/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.](https://preview.redd.it/nuiaio9mamn71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f9e3c95adbb878e638893438837dee3d49118e)

# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read ""gamma squeeze"" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.

&amp;#x200B;

Just like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards ""options Greeks"" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:

https://preview.redd.it/hz0kcy6ramn71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339f23ff1cb64170eb0e7acb54f24a391d2778fa

Based on the current options open interest, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more  OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:

https://preview.redd.it/h1loqynsamn71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e04ed0333bcd045d279a530ec861e9662f2ec65

https://preview.redd.it/1ufjnfjtamn71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63400135150afdb4e406388ddfc2601a9e16977b

Here's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:

||OPAD|IRNT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|
|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|
|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|
|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|
|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|
|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|

While the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.

&amp;#x200B;

And all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.

&amp;#x200B;

# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked

As I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.

&amp;#x200B;

The crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).

https://preview.redd.it/zxyekd0zamn71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bb61225f2af3095bfa8292dd1b343f44e283dc0

Short sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.

&amp;#x200B;

It also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.

What's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.

More importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.

So, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IRNT, the more I realized that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…

&amp;#x200B;

**Low Float:**

IRNT technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SPAC merger, any shares held by (the SPAC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!

https://preview.redd.it/p8zcdt1y2on71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7beb7dbabacf05d4b9c8b1ff5476ca629e073a17

Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IRNT is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON

&amp;#x200B;

**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IRNT's open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realize how fucking high this stock could go

https://preview.redd.it/4ebhx2fz2on71.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fab60a19d8b27b1d1cb4cce9e3a1fe942f5683a7

IRNT has 50,984 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 5.1M shares will be locked up in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME!

It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IRNT is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how MM's will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

5 $19.5 C 9/17,  2 $20 C 9/17, 3 $21 C 9/17, 3 $22.5 C 9/17, 10 $24 C 9/17, 10 $25 10/15 C, 10 $28 18/15 C

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

# Scout Gaming kicks off second half year with multiple deals and sportsbook launch

**From June until now Scout Gaming has secured five agreements, of which four will be participating in the real money network. In addition, Scout has launched its Sportsbook on the first B2B client and is close to launching a previously disclosed collaborative venture with Razer Inc., the world’s leading life-style brand for gamers.**

Scout Gaming, the *world’s leading global provider of B2B Daily Fantasy Sports, Sportsbook, Fantasy betting and other related sport betting products* has put pen to paper to several deals following this summer, of which four will be part of the world’s largest networked real money fantasy games, the Scout Gaming Network (SGN).

Recently, four new contracts with iGaming operators joining the network have been signed, out of which one operator has already gone live and two planned to launch before the end of the month. Last week a previously signed operator went live, making the total number of operators in SGN reach ten. With the addition of what is under integration, including Swedish market leader ATG, the number of SGN operators is expected to surpass fifteen by the end of year which would also mean that the number of SGN operators would then have doubled in less than 6 months.

Amongst the operators recently signed is ***Golden Matrix Group***, a publicly traded Las Vegas based US turnkey content and white-label provider focusing on emerging markets. Another noteworthy addition is Olympic Entertainment Group, an Estonian licensed and regulated land-based and online casino operator who is currently number 1 online operator in Estonia, and top three in Baltics overall.

In addition to the growth of the real money network, Scout is bringing several new products to market. One of which is via a collaboration project with Razer Inc. the world’s leading lifestyle brand for gamers and innovator in the field of e-sports. The parties have collaborated in recent months to develop a mobile app(IOS/Android). Razer operates the world’s largest gamer focused ecosystem of hardware, software and related services and its roughly 150 million users will be able to enjoy Scout’s products by connecting their RazerID through the app. 

A couple a weeks ago, the market leading Norwegian operator, Norsk Tipping went live with Scout Gaming’s software. They are currently under a beta-test for real-money-gaming which so far has met their expectations. It is the first time in eight years, a new gaming vertical for real money has been launched on the Norwegian market. Norsk Tipping are collecting customer feedback before going into a full market launch. We have long-term high expectations on Norsk Tipping to deliver substantial liquidity to SGN. 

Adding to achievements, Scout has since 2019 been developing a Sportsbook on its proprietary tech stack, which entails setting up and growing an in-house odds trading and risk department. The Sportsbook via Fanteam.com and with the recent addition of live odds markets plus a long list of features planned in upcoming releases during the remainder of the year, the Sportsbook is now in the process of full commercialization.. In a given week the Sportsbook is covering roughly 20,000 betting markets spanning across 50+ international sports &amp; leagues of which a sizable portion is attributable to Player Performance Odds also referred to as ‘fantasy bets’, unique betting markets only available via Scout Gaming. The first ‘full Sportsbook B2B client went live this month already taking bets via the Scout Sportsbook.

Andreas Ternström, Chief Executive Officer at Scout Gaming, said: “It’s with great pride when I recognize the rate at which our team is continuing to push boundaries. We continuously sign and launch operators at a rapid pace whilst executing on an ambitious roadmap. The level at which this company is bringing new products to life is one that I have never seen before. This is owed to the investments made in not only our own technology but the people that create it. It’s taken us a while to get here but in return we are building an extremely strong foundation for continuous growth

Today, you will enjoy the greatness and see why $YANG is still the best risk:reward trade in the universe.

# Hwanging for $YANG (leveraged gains on gains)

[Cathie 😍 sold all of her China stocks, and Bill Hwang, the 🐐 was banned from Hong Kong trading which lists many Chinese stocks](https://preview.redd.it/5ch1177d7on71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e5a7cbefad8eaf3f10beec778dcddbc706b2e46)

$YANG is a beautiful ETF that is 3x the inverse of China. Like the great Bill Hwang, I have learned a lot about leverage and how to properly use it to amplify my returns. Just a direct China inverse ETF is boring. For me to become rich, I need to add leverage, and $YANG is the perfect ETF for that goal. On top of that, I will be buying YANG 65 calls for January, the furthest OTM calls available. YANG 65 calls can create a gamma squeeze in the event China has a total and rapid collapse.

Chinese stocks have been declining this entire year, and still have a long way to go. Cathie 😰 has sold her China stocks, mentioning that she is done dealing with Xi‘s rugpulls and navigating the uncertainties of the CCP. The CCP makes China common stocks look like options.

# Evergrande

Evergrande is China’s 2nd best real estate developer. They currently have over $350 billion in liabilities, which they are quickly defaulting on. Like many Chinese real estate companies, Evergrande has built many ghost cities. These cities cost billions of dollars and lie uninhabited, ultimately being destroyed or collapsing on their own. These cities do not provide any recurring economic value, and waste money, time, and materials.

&amp;#x200B;

[One of China’s many ghost cities that will eventually crumble without any positive economic output](https://preview.redd.it/ixykh5qe7on71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbabb44f9ae610b5250a6b5dc72ea9faa4eb3184)

# Evergrande bonds are like SPY 0 DTE puts

Just like how SPY 0 DTE puts always go to $0 because SPY only goes up, buying Evergrande bonds is nearly identical. Many of Evergrande’s face value bonds have declined 60-80%, with yields rising from 9.5% to over 1,100%. As Evergrande defaults on bonds, investors lose billions of dollars. This will trickle to other companies as there will be less capital to invest elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

[Just one example of Evergrande's \\""distressed\\"" bonds. There is over $355 billion of bad debt. To put this in perspective, Lehman brothers defaulted on $60B of debt](https://preview.redd.it/2ejo3y0h7on71.png?width=1888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=247af399649ccf39af2845d35e5830c34db71a2e)

# If Evergrande collapses, it will take China’s real estate market with it

Evergrande is the second best real estate developer in China. #2! This is like Microsoft saying they are filing for bankruptcy. Real Estate makes up over 30% of China’s GDP. Many people invest their entire life savings, parents money, and borrowed money into their home. If real estate collapses, the rest of China’s consumption will go down with it. Evergrande poses massive systemic risk to China’s economy. This is a massive domino effect that will cause a decline. Lending will be restricted, further slowing growth as China’s growth is fueled by debt, not consumption, which is not a sustainable path forward. When China stops allowing new debt to be issued, growth will decline rapidly and be unstoppable.

# China’s Economy is slowing or declining

If you trust the CCP’s numbers, then Chinas economy is slowing. If you don’t trust the CCP numbers, then China’s economy is declining. Retail sales were expected to grow 7%, instead they only grew 2.5%.   This is a terrible report that shows how connected all parts of China’s economy are. Real Estate is also in trouble. Because of Evergrande, home sales by value dropped 20% in August alone. Morgan Stanley also cut earnings estimates for Chinese property companies by 13%. These are not numbers you see in a growing, booming economy.

# How Xi will buy me a yacht and a roadster

[Fill be up, baby. I will build the largest penis shaped rocket when I become a billionaire from YANG](https://preview.redd.it/f4zarynm7on71.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c9e2fc705c9ad5353fd475b866aae029a5bb8e2)

Through my advanced quantitative models, I see my calls being worth upwards of $5 from their current $0.5. Throw in some IV increase, and it might be a 20 bagger.

I tried buying the dip on AAPL and I realized that stocks can go lower than what you entered in at. I quickly realized my mistake and tried to refund my calls but apparently you need a receipt! So, now I have 155 strike price calls, with an entry at $150. I told myself, ""You know what, it can't go lower."" So I bought more calls at $148. And like magic, it went to $147! All of us (me, my wife, and her boyfriend) were shocked that I was two for two! (Also that I'm down $8k the past month, so I'm really like 34/34).  

&amp;#x200B;

It's clear to me I have a God-given ability to control the markets. Every time I buy, the stock goes lower. Hence, when I sell, it'll probably have the biggest rebound seen in the past 3 decades. It'll make the March 2020 rebound look like a fucking descent.

In conclusion, guys just let me know! Let me know when you have seen enough red on AAPL and I'll sell my calls so it can go up! Or, if you're interested, pm me and ask, ""Hey, what are you going to buy today?"" I'll tell you what I'm buying so you can take out a loan to short it.

[OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/0z9j53b2bon71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f1c45bdd00818c3f61abc3640cd686efde050)

# Background

&amp;#x200B;

First, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.

https://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797

An iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.

Offerpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.

[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)

As a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) in the first place? Go back to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and your 3 fund portfolio.

Also, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).

Closed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.

# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read ""gamma squeeze"" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.

Just like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards ""options Greeks"" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.

Since I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:

https://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb

Based on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.

Right now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.

Also, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.

Here is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:

https://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8

https://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791

Here's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:

&amp;#x200B;

||OPAD|IRNT|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|
|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|
|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|
|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|
|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|
|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|

While the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.

And all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.

# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977

[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)

As I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.

The crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).

https://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634

https://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211

Short sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.

It also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.

[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)

[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)

What's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.

https://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483

More importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547

So, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.

Oh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.

InvestMyMoneyWisely,t2_4kvij7gd,1631625107,po2hr2,True,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/po2hr2/netflix_collaboration_promises_undiscovered/,1,"Xcel brands ($XELB) is a brand management and media company that owns, operates and licenses several brands including Isaac Mizrahi, Halston, Judith Ripka and Highline. The company’s vision is to seek out distressed and beaten down yet highly valuable brands and re-invest/re-launch them. This post focuses on the pivotal impact the new **Netflix series “Halston”** has on their eponymous brand. According to my analysis the show will bring significant value to $XELB shareholders. This event still goes completely **unnoticed by wall street**, being dominated by white males, as the target audience of “Halston” is mainly female. 

The Netflix show is based on the late gay American fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick. Halston's designs were well known for creating a relaxed urban lifestyle for American women, originally producing colourful hats for ladies and later his iconic dresses. Halston lived a very interesting life in the 70’s which is why so many people were fond of the show and the reason the show is so critically well received. The series hit the **top 10 list on Netflix** in several countries. 

When the show first came out in May 2021 Halston launched a limited series collaborative dress collection appropriately titled “Halston X Netflix”. 

What’s interesting is that these dresses were priced lower than most other dresses. They retailed around $300 but there were also some under $100. You can start to imagine just how marketing-savvy the Xcel management team is as the dresses were priced lower to attract a large customer base and we’re hence more affordable. But the collection dresses sold out rapidly. So instead the management decided to create yet another Halston X Netflix capsule but this time the dresses were priced between **$995 and $1595** which I believe was a great idea to capitalise on the sheer raw demand that the brand was receiving thanks to the show. The delivery of those dresses started in August and many of them sold out quickly too.  

https://preview.redd.it/chssjp0rwgn71.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70848ccd7fe17ed6db797135788ed7150672aee2

Profit margins on these dresses must be extremely high as Netflix won\`t even receive any revenues from the sales of the collection. Netflix approached this collaboration solely as a marketing partnership that will allow both brands to cross-promote each other.

The impact of the Halston series has already been noticeable in the Q2 2021 earnings with a YoY r**evenue growth of +113%** for $XELB, not including the high-priced dresses that were delivered in August. For those limited dresses alone I estimate a revenue of at least $1.5M or 14% of Q2’s revenue ($10.76M). 

Another great catalyst for the Halston brand will be the **five nominations** that the show received for the upcoming **Emmy Awards** on September 19. Winning one or multiple awards will likely boost the awareness of the Halston brand once again. Not to be neglected is also the opportunity for the stars to present their glamorous Halston dresses on the red carpet.

For this investment opportunity it is also important to recognise the CEO and his mission. Robert W. D’Loren has been a pioneer of the consumer branded industry for the past 35 years. His goal by forming Xcel brands was to combine the shopping, social and entertainment industry. D’Loren deploys a ‘media first’ strategy at his company which means that they essentially operate in television shopping. The collaborative Netflix show and dress collection makes a lot of sense considering that Netflix is the new age of television and brands should want to advertise on the platform. D’Loren has also been a heavy buyer of the stock for the past year.

**Conclusion**

To conclude it can be said that $XELB will likely surprise wall street with a massive revenue beat in Q3 2021 due its collaboration with Netflix and will furthermore have a bright future as the underlying value of the Halston brand has increased massively.

That being said, I think that it is very likely that Xcel brands could receive **acquisition offers** for the Halston brand or the entire company itself as it currently has a market cap of only $33.22M. It wouldn’t be surprising at all if a Louis Vuitton or a Dior were to try and poach the now prestigious fashion brand for **$100M in cash**.  Also bear in mind that the fashion sector has been red hot this year with luxury goods stocks being up 50%+ YTD (making Bernard Arnault the richest man in the world). When an industry is doing really well there tends to be a lot of M&amp;A activity.

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IRNT, the more I realised that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…  


**Low Float:**

IRNT technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SPAC merger, any shares held by DFNS (the SPAC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!   


https://preview.redd.it/rai2oe4x0hn71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eae2417e783feea62e053312b2462d8a142e183

Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IRNT is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON  


**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IRNT’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go  


[ ](https://preview.redd.it/016zp2p31hn71.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6482e45ee9af8282098d64b1ba5383410e986a3)

IRNT has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IRNT is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how options sellers will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH  


**Positions:**

5 $19 C 9/17, $20 C 9/17, 3 $21 C 9/17, 3 $22.5 C 9/17, 10 $24 C 9/17

Already running based on nothing!

**$IRNT** \- IronNet Cyber Security - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?

None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions DFNS wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.

[https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9](https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9)

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of \~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I \*think\* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return. I view this as extremely speculative, so I've only got \~$2k of exposure in $20 strike September calls, but I may increase that in the coming days.

I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

**Edit:**

From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations. The exact numbers are below.

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

**Edit #2:**

I'm now fairly confident the incentive shares are subject to the lockup, so until registration of the PIPE shares, we're looking at 2.5M float plus whatever has been gifted to charity. Warrants can't convert for another 30 days, so those are also not a threat at the moment.

At first I was skeptical of this play because most ‘squeeze’ plays are shitty P&amp;D’s… but the more I looked into IRNT, the more I realised that this is a legitimate play which has the potential to 5X or MORE

Let me explain…  


**Low Float:**

IRNT technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SP\*AC merger, any shares held by DFNS (the SP\*AC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!   


https://preview.redd.it/ycs9ilbg2hn71.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbf699d1ad5889fc20cdbc0bf6a250e9413e9ee3

 Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IRNT is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON  


**Options:**

Now here is where it gets interesting...

On its own IRNT’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go  


https://preview.redd.it/9s5vq0rj2hn71.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70922f5f75c7c85b047433738fd3ca871913645

 IRNT has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IRNT is unable to issue ANY new shares

I don’t even know how options sellers will survive this… All I know is that I am going to get FUCKING RICH  


**Positions:**

5 $19 C 9/17, $20 C 9/17, 3 $21 C 9/17, 3 $22.5 C 9/17, 10 $24 C 9/17

This company has a market cap of 1.58b according to marketwatch.com

""None of the subs I'm active on will take a post on this one since the market cap is too low. I've got to share it with someone, so the 57 of you following me directly may or may not see this.

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background. DFNS, a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $IRNT is far below that, but before redemptions D.F.N.S wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the .C.B.O.E liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest O.I from C.B.O.E. That data is below.

[https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9](https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9)

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of \~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

I've outlined a few key-points that were gathered from EOD data following Monday's close.

**TLDR: The market is setting up a face-ripping rally that will send CCJ's Sept 17th calls to mars.**

# I.  NAV Premium

As many of you know, the driver behind Uranium's rapid rise has been Sprott Assett Management.  Basically, they have created a fund to allow investors to gain exposure to physical holdings of Uranium, and in doing so, they have attracted a geometric fuck-ton of attention and funding from the public.  

We can consider Sprott to be the ""Fuel"" behind the rise in not only Uranium's Spot, but also the meteoric 50+% monthly increases in Uranium stocks (CCJ, URA, UUUU, etc...).  My question after today was whether or not this fuel was running out, and what I've gathered is that the answer is overwhelmingly NO.  

First and foremost, we heard at the end of last week that Sprott was going to issue an additional $1b (billion, with a fucking b) of shares to fund more Uranium purchases through the coming days.  The mechanism which drives these purchases is simple; they put all of their cash into uranium.  Taking that one step further, the question you should be asking is ""Where do they get their cash?""  That's also simple, when their NAV falls below the market's pricing of the fund (aka, investors are paying more money for Uranium exposure than its spot price indicates it's worth), they issue more shares of stock.  This gives them direct access to cash, which, in essence, gives them direct access to more uranium.

What we can see below is the fund's valuation (green) against the NAV of their holdings (essentially all uranium).  **There was already a huge gap between Sprott's valuation and it's NAV, but that gap has soared significantly today.  This is the catalyst for more buying; Uranium's momentum isn't slowing down, its speeding up.**

[Sprott's Uranium Fund NAV \(Yellow\) vs. Price \(Green\)](https://preview.redd.it/fcggphhvmen71.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59de1f81d1666e8b63e46e34559781bc4c1997e2)

Shown another way, below is the actual premium of NAV to price that the fund is being traded at.  **It is trading over 28% higher than it's value (up from just 16% on Friday).**

[Historical NAV Premium](https://preview.redd.it/esqjzfdeqen71.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37092e138b32231f177db84d8fd35602a5e340bf)

# II.  Uranium

Really quickly, I just want to show you Uranium's Spot price for the year.

[Uranium Spot Price\/Pound](https://preview.redd.it/lup1xmyvqen71.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146ab90cf06b882e7c8e3ebac863846ad04b7f58)

You can see the exact moment Sprott started purchasing uranium on July 19th, and they haven't slowed down one bit.  I expected to see spot prices down today when $CCJ behaved as it did, but **Uranium is up another 4% on the day.**  That's not a small increase at all! 

The real question becomes this: ""How high can Uranium go?  Isn't it already up so far that we likely missed the play?""  

Well, to that I say zoom out:

This won't happen in a week, but we haven't seen shit yet.

# III. Gamma (A Lesson in Greek)

For those of you who are smart enough to get your investment advice from wallstreetbets, gamma is the one that tells you how much an option's delta will change with respect to a price change in the underlying stock price.  For those of you who are smart enough to put your life savings on weeklies (not pointing fingers at anyone but myself here), delta is the one that tells you how much your option's value will change with respect to a price change in the underlying stock.  This is important to know when understanding how a gamma squeeze works.

It's also important to know how market makers hedge their portfolio against those OTM call options they just sold you.  As you (hopefully) know, an option gives you exposure to 100 shares of a stock (no, really, if you don't know that you honestly shouldn't be touching options.  You're so fucking fucked).  When you multiply 100 by the delta of a given option contract, you essentially find the amount of shares of stock a market maker would need to buy to completely hedge their exposure to the options that they are short.  

**The key detail, however, is that hedging that way only hedges their position at that exact moment.**  The delta of an option that is very in-the-money is about 1 (delta essentially tells you how likely it is that your option will expire in the money according to the complicated brain of the market).  The delta of an option that is very far out of the money is about 0.  It's dependent on price.  **So while market makers may be hedged well today, if the price of $CCJ rises before friday, the delta of every call option will increase.**  

This means that they will have to buy more shares of stock to hedge their position again, causing the price to rise further, causing the delta of the options to rise further, causing them to buy more shares to hedge their position again... you get the fucking idea.  A gamma squeeze!

For this to happen, though, there needs to be enough outstanding options to fuel such a price movement.  So lets take a look at the options chain for $CCJ; first I'll show you the options chain for the end of next week:

[Sept 24 Options Chain for CCJ](https://preview.redd.it/hvh83sk5ven71.png?width=1005&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a930bb42f822182dcccea467650ffe473f516bd6)

Looking at the open interest, we can see that there aren't that many options expiring on the 24th.  Even the most commonly traded strike of $25 only has 1403 contracts outstanding, indicating 140,300 shares of exposure (that may sound like a lot of shares, but this is a huge company and that kind of volume wouldn't move shit).

So now lets compare this to this Friday's option chain:

[Sept 17th Options Chain for CCJ](https://preview.redd.it/5ebpyiziven71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1869b96bc403948cc3302bdccc0f28ccace0eb9)

Good fucking god.  

I'll remind you that the price movement from a gamma squeeze comes from a **change in delta**.  This means that the contracts that have a delta close to 1 (the in-the-money ones, pretty much anything below the 20 dollar strike) will not do much to push a gamma squeeze further.  

But look at the amount of exposure in the ATM and OTM contracts!  **2,543,400 shares of exposure at $24, 7,656,800 shares at $25, and almost 10,000,000 more shares that are out of the money** (these are the real focus).  There are even more contracts beyond that $29 strike.  If we see $CCJ move up a few dollars during the week, market makers are going to take things much further when they have to hedge their short with millions of shares.  

What's going to drive the price up a few dollars you ask?  How about uranium's fucking spot price?  What we saw today in $CCJ was nothing more than a lack of confidence; I wouldn't be surprised if $CCJ smashes through $35 by Friday, my confident bet is that we will at least break through $30.

Let me explain…  


**Low Float:**

IronNet technically has a float of 84.4m, but because it was recently a SP\*AC merger, any shares held by DFNS (the SP\*AC) or insiders are locked up for the next few months…

This means in reality ONLY 5.76M shares are able to physically be sold and ONLY 2.528M can be traded!

Additionally, because of the lock-up agreement, IronNet is unable to issue ANY additional shares so there is no way they can increase the float

What this means is any options/shares you purchase will have a MUCH larger impact on the stock price

A low float also makes gamma squeezes WAY more likely because every share an MM purchases to delta hedge and/or sell a call is a larger percentage of the overall float

If the ITM open interest exceeds the amount of available shares, MM's are LITERALLY unable to get enough shares to cover their side of the transaction which will send this to the FUCKING MOON

On its own IronNet’s open interest is crazy, but once you factor in the tradable float you start to realise how fucking high this stock could go

IronNet has 44,434 calls expiring on 9/17 with many already being ITM. This means that up to 4.4M shares will be locked in these contracts

This is INSANE! Literally 2X the tradable float! And unlike short sellers, MM’s need to buy all these shares by a set deadline. This means that 4.4M shares will need to be purchased and all locked up at THE SAME TIME  
It is physically IMPOSSIBLE for MM’s to get enough shares for the 9/17 expiry because there literally aren’t EVEN enough tradable shares in existence

And unlike GME or AMC, IronNet is unable to issue ANY new shares

Ternium and SID are two very different companies, but the play is fundamentally similar. In the wake of Ternium's run up, SID is now the most undervalued steel producer in the Americas.

# S.I.D. - Steel. Is. Delicious.

SID is a major supplier of flat steel products in Brazil and abroad. Formed as a state-owned enterprise in 1941, taxpayer dollars helped to balloon SID into the largest steel producer in the county. In 1993, the Brazilian government sold off 91% of its stake on the Rio Stock Exchange and released strategic control of the company.

Under fortunate leadership, in the latter half of the 1990's and early 2000's SID would leverage their profitability in steelmaking to acquire a veritable web of complementary businesses throughout Brazil and abroad. In a masterclass of vertical integration, SID:

* [ Acquired hydroelectric and thermal plants](https://www.csn.com.br/en/about-us/csn-group/csn-energia/) to internalize power production.
* Cut out the middlemen in end market sales by [absorbing two major steel distributors](https://ri.csn.com.br/en/company/history-and-corporate-profile/).
* [Purchased and pioneered](https://www.csn.com.br/en/about-us/csn-group/csn-mining/) mining operations to enter the Ore market and internalize raw material costs.
* Cut transportation overhead by [acquiring the concessions for major railways.](https://www.csn.com.br/en/about-us/csn-group/ftl/)
* Entered receiving and logistics through [operating their own port.](https://www.csn.com.br/en/about-us/csn-group/sepetiba-tecon/)
* Gained key access to high-margin steel markets by purchasing [Lusosider](https://www.csn.com.br/en/about-us/csn-group/lusosider/) in Portugal, [SWT](https://www.csn.com.br/en/about-us/csn-group/swt/) in Germany, and even a [structural steel company in the US](https://heartlandsteel.com) (which, by the way, is minting money with the [warehouse boom](https://www.reddit.com/r/StructuralEngineering/comments/mnrrnd/current_joist_shortage_alternate_options/)).
* And expanded into cement production through numerous acquisitions (cement is another of many construction end materials whose [price has jumped](https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/u.s.-construction-material-cost-shock-escalates) globally).

Fast forward to 2021. [Steel prices have tripled in the past year](https://www.barrons.com/articles/steel-prices-51625868707) across high-margin finished products globally. In SID we have a company that literally owns or operates the power supply, the raw materials mining and refining, the pre-finished casting product production, the finished steel production, the transportation network, the distribution and sales network, and a fucking port. **And they're trading at a 3.06 Price to Earnings ratio, at the HIGHEST EV/EBITDA in the sector.**

# Key Points

**Infrastructure, Demand, and Pricing Power**

SID is the largest and most profitable steel producer in the largest South American economy. They will be a primary beneficiary of the [**billions to be spent on infrastructure investment**](https://www.ft.com/content/4fd61b40-8056-4d4a-9b3b-e3c9c243924e) as Brazil emerges from COVID and modernizes their built environment. What's more, the Brazilian and South American markets stand out in pricing resiliency. Steel prices have [begun to wane in Europe](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/4007599/Flat-products/EUROPE-HRC-WRAP-Sentiment-negative-on-lower-automotive-demand-competitive-imports.html) due to lax automobile production, and there is speculation the US will follow thanks to [talks relaxing the TEA 232 Tariff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/u-s-moves-toward-settling-steel-tariff-dispute-with-offer-to-eu) protections. [**That is not the case in Brazil**](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/091020-feature-brazil-steel-prices-rally-on-strengthening-demand-weak-supply) \- prices are still rising. 

SID is minting money. They are consistently profitable even in economic downturns thanks to their diversified revenue streams, but PRINT money in boom cycles thanks their integration across the entire production, sales, and delivery lifecycle. Think I'm kidding?   


[Quarterly and TTM Net Income for SID. Even in global steel market busts like 2008-2015, SID turned a net profit. ](https://preview.redd.it/38njzbjdgen71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8027fdc9690df939bb28b516ad85002eddbde83f)

When the steel market is hot, SID is a money machine. look at that graph: $3 Billion in net income over the past twelve months while currently sitting at a capitalization of less than $9 billion. For comparison, SID has a similar debt profile to Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), a major American flat steel producer and miner, but is trading at 1/4 the TTM Price to Earnings Ratio (3.0 to CLF's 13.00).

Iron ore, energy, and shipping costs have all risen alongside finished steel prices post-COVID.  SID is the only Brazilian steelmaker that mines it's entire iron ore needs, **and actually made more money in 2020 from selling ore to competitors than they did from selling steel.** SID's footprint in mining and transport enabled them to shrug off higher input and carry costs and realize record profits via strong end-market demand for both Steel and iron ore.

SID actually 

**Market Mechanics: Volume and Institutional Ownership**

SID trades on slightly lower volume relative to the rest of the steel sector. Here are the rough 100-day Average Dollar-Volumes of their industry peers in the Americas:\*

1. TX -  $ **43,475,903.3**
2. NUE - $ **364,270,088**
3. CLF - **$ 542,251,105**
4. SID - **$ 118,932,000**
5. GGB - **$** **96,436,760**
6. STLD- **$152,581,824**

\**These were calculated with 100 day average volumes from a DD back in June to save time. Volumes have not changed a whole lot across the sector, so they work for approximating overall trends, but are not exact or current.* 

Here we can see that SID trades at a lower volume than it's American peers, though not quite as low as it's Brazilian counterpart Gerdau (GGB), and definitely not as low as Ternium (TX).

However, SID has a huge thing going for it: **Institutional Buy-in.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t9w07mn50fn71.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a843a80fb2c79ca095ccac9d3f6b62b6afc5508

As a baseline, nearly 50% of SID's outstanding shares are retained by their parent/holding company Vicunha Acos S.A., alongside 7 million treasury shares.

18% (248,764,538) of SID's common stock trades on the NYSE as opposed to the Sao Paolo Exchange - Whale Wisdom reports that at the end of 2Q 2021, 40,000,000 of those NYSE shares were held by 13F reporters, up 7% from 1Q 2021. Additionally, the number of individual institutions reporting a position increased by 22%, and 41% of extant holders increased their position size. Twice as many 13F filers increased their positions as decreased them, and twice as many opened a position as closed one. **All of this despite a 54% appreciation in share price over the first 20 trading days of Q2.** The takeaway? **""**Smart Money"" is still showing up to buy.

[Notable 2Q 2021 position increases include:](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sid/institutional-holdings)

* **Morgan Stanley:** Increased stake by **500%.**
* **Renaissance Technolgies:** Increased stake by **61%.**
* **Goldman Sachs:** Increased stake by **152%.**
* **Citigroup:** Increased stake by **101%.**
* **Voloridge Investment Mgmt:** Increased stake by **1,970%.**
* **Two Sigma Investments:** Increased stake by **1,200%.**

SID retains a bullish put/call ratio of 0.35 on the NYSE, substantially unchanged from 1Q. A quarter-over-quarter increase in total option volume close to 300% indicates anticipated future volatility in share price. For the lowly call-buying degenerate, volatility means money. Maybe.

# Bear Cases

There are plenty. **Steel prices could drop precipitously** \- Europe is already showing weakness after all. However, steel pricing is so elevated that even a decline following historic rates of change would see SID completely deleveraged before they leveled off. It is unlikely that finished steel pricing will ever settle at historic trading ranges ever again, thanks to industry-wide trends and changes [discussed in my last DD.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1oikc/ternium_tx_a_masterclass_dd_on_the_most/)

**Iron ore's price drop has also cut into their sales from mining**, but hasn't yet impacted prices for flat steel in South America. SID seems to be trading in a basket with other Brazilian miners irrespective of it's steel and cement operations. Take a look: its 1 year chart is really a less volatile VALE chart with clearer Bull and Bear trends. **This is either an opportunity for arbitrage as SID's earnings remain elevated above other miners thanks to their finished steel exposure, or a pattern that'll persist.**

**Brazil could also implode politically or economically.** I'm not a political wiz, but I feel like Brazil is positioned better than some would think from the headlines. Covid has not really been a killer of the work force (deaths for those 20-59 years old fluctuate around 20% of the totals), and Brazils currency has been performing fantastically relative to the USD the past 6 months. The Reais enjoyed a 10% appreciation against the US dollar between April and July of 2021, and has stayed flat the past two months even against rumors of imminent US rate hikes. You can thank [Brazil's relatively strong](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-central-bank-hikes-interest-rates-eyes-return-neutral-rate-2021-06-16/) monetary policy for that consistency. Of course, Brazilian monetary policy could always take a turn towards too deflationary and risk stagnating the economic growth that's fueling SID right now.

You can read through [SID's 2020 20-F](https://sec.report/Document/0001292814-21-001501/) to get a complete picture of their potential headwinds - their risk disclosure is conveniently placed on pages 4-18 near the beginning. You should really be reading this for every company you invest in, at least until you're familiar with what they say, as companies in similar markets/ regions/ industries usually disclose the same general suite of risks. 

# So... What's the Takeaway?

SID is the slept-on wunderkind of the global steel industry. They're not cutting edge or ESG friendly - they're a huge mining operation, and their massive primary steel plant runs on some of the oldest, nastiest tech in the game - but they **make money.** 

**SID's share price is down 30% from the $8.5-9.5 range it consolidated in for three whole months,** likely sold off with Iron ore and the rest of Brazilian equities (see GGB, PBR, VALE) in reaction to Bolsonaro drama and COVID scares. Good news for them is that likely [nothing is going](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-rio-de-janeiro-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-covid-b1918836.html) to happen with Brazil's executive, and COVID has yet to slow down Brazil's steel industry during this 18 month saga. 

I have recently re-opened a long position in SID. IV is low so I like calls, specifically near the money strikes ($6-7) for December and later. I'm anticipating some more weakness in share prices through OpEx and will leg in as I see opportunities.

Oh also, If you're a boomer on holiday in WSB, their dividend yield is somewhere around 7%. Definitely worse places to park your money than a cash cow cyclical in the midst of a boom.

If you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. 

You're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. 

So, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:

Burry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   
Assets under management (AUM): $635 million

Dalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   
AUM: $140 billion

Buffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  
AUM: $632 billion

Wood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   
AUM: $53 billion

=============================================

If you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. 

 Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:

Take a look at this chart of TSLA

Now with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. 

""Burry is a value-shill permabear""

Burry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5.

He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. 

""Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA""

If you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)

""Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target""

Wood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of ""do as I say, not as I do."" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. 

And lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out.

 ImmunityBio, Inc. (NASDAQ: IBRX), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, today announced updated data from an ongoing bladder cancer trial showing sustained complete response rates in patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive carcinoma in situ (CIS) bladder cancer (Cohort A). Of the 81 patients in the QUILT 3.032 study, 58 patients (72%) had a complete response (CR) at any time (three or six months) to intravesical BCG plus N-803 (Anktiva) with median duration of CR of 19.9 months.

The data also showed a 59% probability (95% confidence interval; 43.1%, 71.2%) that responding patients would maintain a complete response for more than 12 months, based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. For the patients who had a CR within the first three months, the CR rate was 77%, with a 61% probability of remaining disease free at 18 months with the median duration of complete response having not yet been reached in that group. 85% of patients in the cohort avoided a cystectomy with a median duration of follow-up of 20.4 months.

Of note, the therapy was extremely well tolerated with 0% treatment-related SAEs, 0% immune-related AEs and 0% grade 4 or 5 treatment-related AEs. In contrast, the currently approved checkpoint therapy for this indication is associated with an incidence of 21% immune-related adverse events.

“The data suggest that a high percentage of patients who respond within the first three months to treatment will maintain that complete response for 18 months and possibly beyond. But most importantly, 85% of the patients in the cohort avoided a cystectomy,” said Principal Investigator Karim Chamie, M.D., Associate Professor of Urology at UCLA. “The AUA-[FDA](https://www.streetinsider.com/entities/FDA) workshop set a lofty, clinically meaningful benchmark: 30% of patients receiving treatment for their BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer remaining disease-free 18–24 months. Unfortunately, none of the FDA-approved (or under FDA evaluation) agents have come close to the goal; by 12 months, only 20% of patients are disease-free. But for the first time, we now have a product with N-803 + BCG that has hit the AUA-FDA 30% 18-month milestone. With its well-tolerated safety profile, I am confident that N-803 + BCG will make a meaningful impact on the lives of patients with BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer.”

The data was announced on Friday, Sept. 10 during an oral presentation at the American Urological Association’s Annual Meeting titled “PD09-05: Phase 2/3 clinical results of IL-15aFc superagonist N-803 with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) carcinoma in-situ (CIS).”

Bladder cancer has a high incidence worldwide; in 2020, an estimated 573,278 new cases were diagnosed and it was the cause of 212,536 deaths1. In the United States, bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed solid malignancy in men and the twelfth for women. In the US, the American Cancer Society estimated 81,400 new cases and 17,980 deaths2. Approximately 75-85% of all newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)3.

“We are pleased with the sustained durable response and the significant avoidance of cystectomy in this patient population. In those patients who responded by three months after the initial treatment, it is encouraging to see that the median duration of that response, even after 18 months, has not yet been reached,” said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Founder and Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of ImmunityBio. “In the resistant patients who were re-induced after failing to respond to N-803 and BCG in the first three months, but who responded following a “rescue reinduction” at six months, the median duration of response was shorter, but nonetheless, this immunotherapy candidate delayed cystectomy.”

Soon-Shiong continued, “We are encouraged by these results showing the potential for a higher and longer-lasting rate of complete response than with the current standards of care in patients facing removal of the bladder as an alternative. This study provides insights into the power of harnessing the immune system, including NK cells and T cells, which are activated by N-803. What is more, the novel IL15 fusion protein N-803 being studied was designed to be administered safely in the urologist’s office, potentially enabling ease of administration and increasing access for patients.”

**The Urgent, Unmet Need to Treat NMIBC and Avoid Cystectomy**

For the last 30 years, BCG immunotherapy has been the standard for treating NMIBC. However, disease recurrence and progression rates remain unacceptably high. Standard-of-care recommendations for these patients include lifetime invasive surveillance and rapid treatment of recurrences, creating a substantial financial burden and drastic impact on quality of life. Of those patients who experience recurrence, approximately 30% will progress and succumb to their disease over a 15-year period, and another 50% will undergo radical cystectomy of the bladder— a surgery to remove the entire bladder that may require removal of other surrounding organs—in an attempt to control their disease4.

Despite the advent of minimally invasive procedures and robotic techniques, the 90-day mortality and morbidity rates in patients who undergo cystectomy remain unacceptably high at 3-6% and 28-64%, respectively5 &amp; 6. Based on this urgent need, FDA published guidance in February 2018 to address BCG unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), stating that the goal of therapy in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is to avoid cystectomy.

nobjos,t2_q15pxyy,1631539217,pnfanu,True,24,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnfanu/the_medallion_fund_the_greatest_moneymaking/,1,"Jim Simons, the founder of the Medallion Fund has done what most people consider to be impossible. His fund has consistently beaten the market over the last 30 years. The fund has had an average return of 66% before fees during the period of 1988-2018!

To put these returns in perspective, $100 invested into the Medallion Fund in 1988 would have converted into $398 Million by 2018. Even net of fees \[1\], the fund has outperformed S&amp;P 500 returns by \~1000 times and Warren Buffet’s returns by \~200 times!

If you are still not convinced about the absurdity of the returns, take a look at the following chart which showcases the annual returns for the Medallion fund in comparison with S&amp;P 500.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xam8eg4vt9n71.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ebebbcfdc4ee35fdb5e3fa1f7cf856fcc62cb73)

Notice anything strange? Since its creation, the fund has only lost money in a single year \[2\] (1989). For the next 30 continuous years, there was not even a single year where their returns dropped below 20%. Even at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, the fund had made an 82% gain net of fees!

We all know that Hedge Funds gets a lot of hate, most of the time justifiably so. But returns like this sustained for such a long time period call for further scrutiny. So in this week’s analysis, we are deep-diving into how the Medallion Fund created such outsized returns for its investors.

**The Beginnings**

Jim Simons has a Ph.D. in Mathematics, taught math at MIT, and has worked for NSA as their codebreaker before turning his attention to the stock market. He was one of the first people who realized that pattern recognition could be applied to beat the stock market.

He created a trading system that uses quantitative models and formed Renaissance Technologies in 1982. The peculiar thing about this hedge fund is that it does not hire anyone from financial or business backgrounds.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tj2elvhwt9n71.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44e87cd7bcaf76d6052c12efc5c7d90eb66d3392)

They solely focus on physicists, statisticians, mathematicians, and signal processing experts and believe that the herd-like mentality of business school graduates leads to poor returns! Renaissance’s headquarters is famously known as the world’s best physics and mathematics department.

This view is extended to their investment philosophy as highlighted by Robert Mercer (Co-CEO), Medallion Fund only focuses on the quantitative model recommendations and not the underlying business performance/strategy \[3\].

**Fund Performance**

I know we discussed the extraordinary returns of the fund in the beginning, but the following chart will put the sheer numbers into perspective.

https://preview.redd.it/zzpminjxt9n71.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=865d78e6c622eede6af11f19d4b74c57c7dc8283

By now we know that the fund has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a wide margin. But in [this research paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504766) by Bradford Cornell (Finance Prof at UCLA), he argued that even if the investor had the ability to predict the stock market returns perfectly on a monthly basis (shift the money to treasury during downturns and back to stocks during the upswings), the investor would only have been able to turn the $100 into $331K (an insane 331,100% return) but even this would be nothing in comparison to the \~$400 MM return generated by The Medallion Fund. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tszpk20zt9n71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c307430604716d1126a7038deb3f13034f136f7)

It’s not often you see Warren Buffet so low down a list for long-term investment returns. The Medallion Fund has beaten all the well-known investment managers by a wide margin over its 30 year period.

**Fund Strategy**

While the exact inner workings of the fund are only known to a few key insiders who are tightly bound by confidentiality clauses, what we know comes mainly from the book ‘The Man Who Solved The Market’ by Gregory Zuckerman \[4\].

As per the book, Medallion strategy involves holding thousands of short-term long, and short positions (aka like your avg [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) user) at any given time. Allegedly, they win 50.75% of the trades they make (not like your avg [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) user) which is enough to make them billions as they are conducting millions of trades every year.

Adding to the excellent quantitative models they have created, Medallion Fund also did two things right

1. **Leverage:** It’s estimated that Medallion trades with 12.5x leverage on average with it going up to 20x when the system is confident. If you remove the leverage from the picture, the fund’s returns are similar to S&amp;P 500. It’s their effective usage of leverage and deep understanding of risks involved that makes their returns legendary
2. **Fund size cap:** The fund has made sure that their Asset Under Management (AUM) never goes beyond $10Billion. They understand that adding more money might not work with the same strategies and have paid out their returns to their investors to keep the AUM same.

**What does this mean for an average investor?**

The Medallion Fund has been closed to outside investors since 1993. As of now, only the existing and previous employees of the company can invest in the fund. The funds of Renaissance that are open to the public have performed so poorly that the two funds made it the HSBC’s top 20 losers list for 2020.

While it certainly is a bummer that the average investor cannot invest in the fund, this analysis gave us some key insights into the market. The first and most important being that the stock market is not perfectly efficient and that there are inefficiencies that someone can leverage for more than 3 decades. The second being that not all funds that charge an exorbitant fee structure \[1\] are taking money away from the investor. In Medallion’s case, they are justifying their eye-watering fee structure with phenomenal returns.

Finally, this should not be considered as a call to action to find similar funds as not every team with stellar people end up producing market-beating returns \[5\]

**Conclusion**

It’s like Jim Simon’s had created a license to print money with the Medallion Fund. How long the fund’s algorithms can remain a secret and continue generating market-beating returns is anyone’s guess. My incredulity and skepticism during this analysis was perfectly captured by Bradford Cornell in his research paper

&gt;During the entire 31-year period, Medallion never had a negative return despite the dot.com crash and the financial crisis. Despite this remarkable performance, the fund’s market beta and factor loadings were all negative, so that Medallion’s performance cannot be interpreted as a premium for risk bearing.  
&gt;  
&gt;To date, there is no adequate rational market explanation for this performance.

Until next week…

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The fund charges an exorbitant amount of fees. From 2002 onwards, it has a 5% management fee and 44% performance fee. To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into the fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $130K (a 30% return), they would charge you $5K (5% management fee) + $13.2K (44% of the profit) for a total of $18.2K in fees. So your net returns would only be 11.8%. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $5K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!

\[2\] Even in the year, their returns were negative, the fund returns before the fee were + 1%. The 5% management fee pushed them to the -4% net returns.

In those patients who responded by three months after the initial treatment, it is encouraging to see that the median duration of that response, even after 18 months, has not yet been reached,” said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Founder and Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of ImmunityBio. “In the resistant patients who were re-induced after failing to respond to N-803 and BCG in the first three months, but who responded following a “rescue reinduction” at six months, the median duration of response was shorter, but nonetheless, this immunotherapy candidate delayed cystectomy.”

Soon-Shiong continued, “We are encouraged by these results showing the potential for a higher and longer-lasting rate of complete response than with the current standards of care in patients facing removal of the bladder as an alternative. This study provides insights into the power of harnessing the immune system, including NK cells and T cells, which are activated by N-803. What is more, the novel IL15 fusion protein N-803 being studied was designed to be administered safely in the urologist’s office, potentially enabling ease of administration and increasing access for patients.”",wallstreetbets,"ImmunityBio (IBRX) Announces Positive Durable Responses in BCG Unresponsive Bladder Cancer Patients with a Complete Response Rate of 72%, Median Duration of Complete Response of 19.9 Months, and 85% R",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnfcsu/immunitybio_ibrx_announces_positive_durable/

It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.

The setup is simple:

1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.
2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float
3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a ""pre-squeeze"" movement, there is likely far more to come.
4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.
5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.

 If $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $PHUN, $ORGO &amp; $GME.

$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.

Be warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.

It's a deep sea mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9-9.50 range).

The key thing here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million PIPE shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).

Okay, so why do we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocks we've ever seen this week:

The current float is 2.72 million because 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.

The short interest is around 1.77 million shares (or roughly 65% of the current float is short).

But here's the ""canary in the coal mine"": the open interest.  Market makers were selling calls based on the prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've potentially sold much more than the entire current float:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09

There's 25k calls for 9/17 between $10 and $12.50.  That's 2.5 million shares.  There's another 8.2k calls for 9/17 between $14 and $15.  That's another 820k shares.

**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls.**  **If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**

That's just September.  Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...

**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.**

(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).

I'm gonna be honest, I have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SP ACs recently is unprecedented).  MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or all hell will break loose.

Easiest way/lowest risk way to play this is just buy stock (which should go up 200-300% in a ""gamma + short squeeze"" scenario).  September calls are super risky but will pay off in 5/10/15 baggers if the stock actually gets past $15 and rockets.

October calls are lower risk than September but should still turn in 4/6/8 baggers if it gets past $15.

Positions: 1000 shares of stock. 250 $12.50 calls, 200 $15 calls for Sept.  

As always do your own DD, I think this is the most explosive setup ever, but it may just stay pinned under $10 and then the calls are worthless.

How do we go about figuring out how many shares are owned and what type of account they're in?

Right now we are at the bounce point, I am not going to post a ticker when it is at the highs, it is stupid and pathetic for new traders to do that. This one is in the buy zone if it is going to send this week. You buy these things when they are ugly, not when they are at the top. I think regardless if it squeezes hard or not there is upside here. Risk is risk but scared money doesn't make money.

As far as whether you believe in the company or not or their product, they make money and are a growth stock. I would like to keep this more about technical analysis but there are some things to consider outside of the analysis. CNBC did a piece on $SDC trashing their product. **Considering the way that CNBC has protected CITADEL in the past**, we may seem some indication here of who is actually short on this stock. CURRENTLY $SDC is embattled in a lawsuit for 2.85 billion dollars.

src97,t2_6d8nuj,1631458680,pmu6re,True,32,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pmu6re/v_ma_the_bullish_case/,1,"So you might have heard of these 2 like really big boomer companies: Visa and Mastercard. They both had great earnings but since the end of July V is down around 10% and MA around 15%. Red week after red week. You might wonder why. The thing is that no one really knows, as no really strong fundamental bearish argument can be dug up. 

Some people are saying that the recent drop is due to the BNPL companies pick up some steam. While that might me the case, I don't really see them taking the place of V and MA in the next few years. 

Firstly, they currently obey little to no regulation. We all know where that leads. The central banks around the world won't allow for much longer for """"fintechs"""" to go around lending money with very little to no credit check. Debt is already starting to form bubbles in different sectors of the market (look at govies, fucking Greece borrowing at negative interest rates lol, but more importantly the junk bonds are quite on fire with everyone trying to get some decent returns but that makes the yields drop even more). What nobody wants is a fucking retail debt bubble. So IF BNPL continues to get more market share, regulators will surely step in rather sooner than later. 

A second point is the demographics of the BNPL. Everyone has a credit/debit card, but not everyone is going to open accounts with fintechs to buy shit. Why would they do it when they already have that since forever from a bank that they more or less trust? BNPL is more appealing to the Z crowd, while the millenials and boomers (the segments having the highest wealth and spending) go with the credit cards. Not to mention the high and ultra high income people. 

Lastly (I have a few more points really but I'm bored talking about fucking BNPL), take a look at their valuations. Some BNPLs are worth like 15-20% of V. Companies that are losing (a lot of) money year after year. 

So, BNPL aside, why do I think V and MA will go up? Well, multiple reasons:

* the market will realize sooner or later that they are trading bellow fair price and as such the market will level this out. You can make money by getting ahead of the market or by riding the wave up;
* travel picking up again, Delta is just noise for the countries with high vaccination rates; this increases spending and even better spending in foreign currency; the FX revenues of these companies has understandably fallen since the pandemic;
* more and more payments are going cashless. While this has been true for a few years all around the world, the trend has picked up some pace especially in the emerging and developing countries where the entire market share goes to V and MA. 
* spending season is set to start. You can figure out yourself what this means
* earnings are also approaching. By this fact alone the companies will get more attention from the smart money. If you decide to play this via options, you will get a nice vega bump
* price action: after dropping like 2 rocks, they actually had a decent week until they were taken down with the market last Friday

&amp;#x200B;

Positions? I have V and MA shares in my boring investment account. I added more on the drop. I also have 225 and 227.5 calls on V expiring next Friday (the retard in me) and Oct 15 230, 235 and 240 calls. I exited my MA position because I was getting way overleveraged on this play, but I still hold my thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

How you can play this? Well, the safest way is through shares. It might not be this week or this month, but this companies WILL go up. Other than that... calls ofc. I would advise at least 2 weeks out, but try to go for a month or more. I would go for the 230 and 235 on V, similar OTM strikes for MA.

Goldman Sachs on Heplisav-B: ""We believe DVAX’s two-shot hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine Heplisav-B is potentially best-in-class in the HBV vaccination space which, despite COVID-19 headwinds in 2020, already generates nearly [$400M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/400M) in revenues annually in the US in spite of modest market penetration. To that end, the key near-term event for DVAX shares is the October vote by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the potential recommendation for HBV vaccination for all adults, which has the potential to both improve market uptake among at-risk populations and more broadly expand the market to non-at-risk individuals. Given Heplisav-B’s potential best-in-class efficacy and two-dose convenience, we believe DVAX would likely prove a key beneficiary of this potential positive CDC ACIP vote.""

Goldman Sachs on CpG1018: ""Beyond HBV, DVAX’s adjuvant CpG 1018 has potential use across multiple late-stage COVID-19 vaccines which, if successful, could provide substantial non-dilutive cash through supply agreements. Overall, we view DVAX’s Heplisav-B as a potentially market-changing HBV vaccine, with COVID-19 adjuvant partnerships providing multiple near-term call options.""

Wainwright on CpG1018: ""Due to the high incidence of the Covid delta variant and the consensus that vaccine boosters could become commonplace, the analyst believes the revenue generated from Dynavax's adjuvant for Covid vaccines could be higher than initially expected.

If you can’t see that as being why this market is overvalued I don’t know what to tell you. What are you going to do if it goes down 5%? 10%? 25%???…. There hasn’t been a 5% correction all year, those are healthy corrections for a BULL market. This is a bear speaking, who would love for a 25% + correction. A couple trades alone in 1-2 months would get me out of debt and give me sufficient starting Capital for my trading business. So I’m not trying to give bull bias here, I’m saying, it is more likely we engage in a normal healthy correction (5%). This time I will ride up the dip when it reverses, but it should serve as a warning that an actual crash (50%+) is incoming in the next two years. 

There are way too many catalysts for even the bullish bull to ignore, and willful ignorance won’t work when that printer is shut off. You’ll be putting money in my pockets so I don’t care if you listen to this or not, just don’t say you haven’t been warned.

If you hate the bears, cool, but it’s better to hate bears and still throw a punch rather than bitching from the sidelines. Just my two cents. Ban if I’m wrong about the next couple of months.

**Thesis:** Low-interest rate environment, higher wages, and remote work will drive homebuying tailwinds for the next 3 years.

M/I Homes sells to the lower-middle-class market with a diverse customer base, including first-time and move-up buyers. Their product appeals to buyers emphasizing affordable home designs.

They service Florida, Texas, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois. 

**Why should you care?**  Since remote work and the price of homes have taken off, people are moving to more rural, affordable areas. 

*Let's look at the numbers:*

**P/E:** M/I Homes: 5.3 | Lennar: 9.2 | Toll: 11.81

**Forward P/E:** M/I Homes: 4.25 | Lennar: 8 | Toll: 7.59

*Don't like numbers?* **Mini TLDR:** M/I Homes sells for half the competitors' stock price

So there's an issue with the company, right? Nope. **Gross profit has gone up 113% since 2017**

* 2018: 449m
* 2019: 494m

They have lots of assets, little debt, and are severely undervalued looking to the bigger players in the industry.

They're displaying confidence in operations by initiating a 100m stock buyback.

Listen up!  Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your money**.** Too much, or too good to be true?  Im being conservative. Hear me out.   

**First, I shall Flex:**  

1) I am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I can't figure it out, I know who to ask. 

2) I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.  

Why flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing matters just a little.  With that said, once more, listen up! 

**The Pickle:** 

You youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is, there is NO effective treatment. 

The FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has significant adverse events.  The risk of brain swelling requires serial Brain MRIs.  It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k.  Most incredible is that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make later).

Again, for emphasis, the FDA still approved it because the need is that severe.  President Biden recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation over a trillion dollars.

**The Fix:  $SAVA**

Cassava Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive function in its CMS trial.  The degree and duration of improvement have NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic. It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.  

Yes, we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc.  A genuine criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.  

Without getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere criticisms is Phase 3 trials.  There is no valid argument against this statement.  This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use absolute phrases.  If you take away only one point from this article, then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more about him later).  Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy.  Be angry, fellow apes, be angry.   Im just getting started, BTW.

Do market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal? They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the first place.

**The Villan and His Massacre:**

Jordan Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a ""Citizens Petition."" A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit) out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.   

Essentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second, sold their shares.  SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog (https://ad-science.org/), Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.  

1) Jordan Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that patients are literally dying as they wait.  WTF!? Why, why why??  If you aren't angry, somethings wrong with you.  JT states he is concerned for patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected, JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly. In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that is the \*only\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is horrendous (3% success rate)?  Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD in its purest form.  

2) Then why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my position by 30%.  With that said, Im not surprised the masses started selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent, it's an \*opportunity\*—a second chance to buy the stock on clearance. 

**The Financials:**

$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue. 

Fifty million patients are suffering from AD globally.  6 million of those patients reside in the US.  Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs $20k annually, just a bit over a third  the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's soon to fail drug):

1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000

That calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment options).  The current stock price is $50.  The overly conservative valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750

The above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia. 

**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**

If you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment. Thats devastating for patients, but families?  It's not uncommon for families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they ""can't handle it anymore."" This market is massive and unaddressed!  Severely, painfully, and gravely unaddressed.  

I have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process.  JT is only the face of this farce.  Behind him are many short positions making a 100 million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their short-term gain.  There is something far more concerning.

**The Plot Thickens:**

What I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or short-term price action.  There is something much more sinister.  Biogen has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved.  Now it is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a problem:

FDA advisory committee voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently, a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's AD drug.  This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no other therapy on the market.  Well, what happens if a new, more effective medication shows up?  

**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**

Back to our Villian JT.  JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the initial ""Citizens Patetion"") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works.  Why?  I speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer.  There is little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less.  When that happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug.  Biogen already has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to rejuvenate the companies earnings.  Then expediently and as expected, Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.

I believe that is the root issue.  Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam!  A group of us have gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).

**Short term price action:**

1) Im expecting the SP to bounce.  After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a perfect overreaction play.  If you dont know what Im talking about, you can look up ""overreaction with reversion to the mean.""

2) Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within ""weeks to months.""  

3) Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks.  (""Soon"" per Remi)

4) Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.

\#SAVA's float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted with utilization of &gt;90%.  It'll take very little to make SAVA move, big.  Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.  

I have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on SAVA.  My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!).  I'll finish with one last piece of advice.  Over 19 years of investing, my most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further propagated by ""experts"" tweeting and commenting with their hidden agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual published results, but apparently, her opinion counts?  Comments of her blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, ""oh, he sounds smart, so he must be right."" or ""That sounds complicated, he must be on to something.""  In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical details are fooling many.   DFV saw something well before masses, and he was paid handsomely for it.

If my opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen, then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs. a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.

For me, we are currently in a classic Wyckoff reaccumulation phase firmly in phase D (trend within range). I strongly believe we will be retesting the $60-$65 region in the coming weeks and potentially breaking out above the prior ATH after that. The test of this region will provide further clues are to where this market is going. My target for the next leg up if we breakout above the prior ATH is around $300-$400. Mental stop loss below $40 (sorry permabulls I’m not riding this into the grave if the trade goes south).

GME is at the end of a HUGE flag, high and tight. It is the biggest I have ever seen in my trading career.

This pattern is easier to see on the log scale and I’ve drawn 2 potential breakout points around $230 and $270. Volume is drying up and we are going to breakout soon. My target for the next leg up if we breakout above the prior ATH is between 4k-8k. Mental stop loss below the last point of support below $145.

### Executive Summary:

Cedar Fair LP (“FUN”) is a US-based regional amusement park/hospitality business, owning/operating 13 properties consisting of 11 amusement parks and 4 separately gated outdoor water parks, all within North America. Like many travel/leisure companies, FUN was severely impacted by COVID in 2020 but has since shown major improvement although 2021 remains a transition year as many parks remained closed earlier in the season. As the US re-opens and concerns around COVID abate, I believe there is significant pent-up demand which should translate to a quick return to pre-COVID attendance levels. There is already preliminary evidence of this as recent attendance remains strong (85% of comparable 2019 levels) despite rising COVID cases. More importantly, COVID has given management a “free pass” to increase prices across the board, helping to boost average in-park spend (up 25% vs. 2019 levels) which I believe will be sticky on the way up. As a result, recent revenue trends have actually already eclipsed comparable 2019 levels (up 3% on a comparable operating day basis). Finally, over the last year, the company has worked to optimize its cost structure which alone, should boost EBITDA by \~$50mm.

Putting all of this together, I believe consensus estimates for 2022 are far too low and peg EBITDA conservatively at \~$650mm (vs. $565mm as per Bloomberg). Based on my estimates, you are creating the business at \~7.9x 2022E EBITDA compared to a LT historical trading NTM EBITDA multiple of \~10x. **A reversion to this historical mean multiple suggests upside of 60% from current prices (\~$70/unit).** If management can successfully offset rising labor costs and hold onto its “per caps,” I think EBITDA could potentially be as high as $700mm+. Coupling this with further increases in season pass penetration, I think there’s merit for modest multiple expansion, similar to what we have already seen in several other leisure names (e.g., Live Nation). Under some unheroic multiple expansion assumptions (for example 10x to 12x), FUN can easily be a 2x from here! From a downside perspective, FUN should be generating FCF going forward and all of its debt has been termed out (next major maturity in 2024) providing ample cushion in terms of recovery timing. At a price of \~$44/unit and a “fair-value” multiple of 10x, the company needs to hit EBITDA of $525mm, which is actually lower than its PF adjusted EBITDA in 2019. In summary, I think the upside/downside at current levels is compelling and provides a solid risk-adjusted return.

An investment in FUN can nonetheless be characterized as a “re-opening trade” at its core and will likely trade in-line in the near-term with the beta of other re-opening names. If you are worried about the spread of the Delta variant and its potential impact on equity valuations, this idea may not be right for you. You can play the re-opening theme across various industries/companies such as cruises, airlines, theatres, events, hotels, casinos, etc. and likely get a directionally similar exposure. **However, I prefer FUN over other re-opening names due to:**

1. Domestic, USD-denominated (primarily), business whose revenues are rooted in the economic health of the US consumer (not tied to business/corporate spend)
2. Regional (driving-distance range) and open-air theme concept should result in a relatively faster recovery
3. Historically a resilient, recession-tested business (see below)

 Limited impact from potential permanent changes to consumer behaviors. I do not think COVID changes the demand for amusement parks in the medium-to-long term unlike for some other industries/sectors (e.g., business travel)

1. Limited threat of secular-disintermediation. Theme-parks are naturally experienced in-person and lack true digital alternatives. While there are more entertainment options now more than ever (including VR), one cannot replicate a roller-coaster experience digitally or “at home.” Amusement parks also play into the secular trend of “experiences” over “goods” — see below

1. At 7.9x 2022E EBITDA (9.3x consensus EBITDA), valuation is modest and below its historical public trading-market multiple of \~10x (8-11x range). Many of the other re-opening trades are currently trading above their pre-COVID valuations particularly when you taking into consideration debt raised and share issuance (For example, AAL has increased its share count by 52% since 2019)
2. Relative underperformance vs. other other re-opening names suggests a possible catch-up is due. See below

### Company Overview:

The company owns/operates 13 theme parks and waterparks in the United States/Canada as well as several resorts, hotels, and recreational facilities (totaling more than 2,300 rooms). In 2019, FUN serviced 28 million attendees. Its largest parks include (1) Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, (2) Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, and (3) Canada’s Wonderland in Toronto.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3fpep3g19wm71.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b26a98dd38f0923e30d65094af0d09b40e995ca

 

The business is not complicated to understand — FUN generates revenues from sales of admissions and food/merchandise/games inside and outside its parks. In addition, the company generates revenues from accommodations. The primary costs are salaries/wages, maintenance, advertising, and utilities. Fixed costs represent about 70% of operating expenses resulting in significant operating leverage (both on the way up and on the way down). The key topline drivers to observe here are attendance and revenue per capita. “Maintenance” capex is roughly 9-10% of revenues. As FUN is technically an MLP, the company pays limited taxes and typically distributes the majority of its cash flows to its unitholders. For unitholders, distributions are “tax advantaged” as they are classified as a “return of capital,” meaning you will likely not need to pay taxes until you sell or recover your cost basis.

The US theme park business is relatively mature and has seen almost no supply growth in recent years. Barriers to entry are very high for a number of reasons, most significantly land costs, local zoning restrictions, transportation infrastructure, and accessibility of capital (a regional park can cost \~$400mm to construct), as well as the fact that many of the most desirable markets already have one or multiple facilities of varying scale. Peak operating season is generally from April through Labor Day, with individual parks varying due to geographic location. A large portion of revenues are generated within a 130-140 day period. The primary demographic groups are families and young people ages 12 through 24.

Lastly, the theme park industry benefits from the shift in consumers’ preferences towards experiences over goods, especially among millennials, who are now having children and need a fun, affordable and family-friendly entertainment alternative. For consumers, a theme park provides a compelling value proposition, costing less than other leisure alternatives (e.g., sporting events) and lasts much longer. The value proposition is even more relevant for season-pass holders, who typically return to a park \~3-4x per season. Season pass programs have grown significantly over the past few years, adding a layer of stability into a business that is dependent on a relatively short operating season.

Since its IPO in 1987, FUN has returned 88x to unitholders (assuming re-investment of distributions). Richard Zimmerman (current CEO) has been with the company effectively since 1998.

### Investment Thesis:

At its core, I believe the market is underestimating profitability going forward. While almost all sell-side estimates have this rated as a “Buy,” I believe consensus still remains too low. FUN should be in a position to begin distributions to unitholders as soon as next year which should serve as the next meaningful catalyst. The company is currently prevented from declaring distributions due to debt covenants but believes if current strength continues in 2H-21/1Q-22, they could be in a position to modify these. 

#### 1. Attendance levels will rebound despite COVID

Regional park operators all benefit from the fact that they are not very reliant or reliant at all on air travel for demand. Typically, the vast majority of attendance comes from a 150-mile radius around the park. With people having been locked up for over a year, regional park operators should be one of the first COVID-impacted leisure activities to recover due to their locations/accessibility. While some people may still be hesitant to fly (particularly abroad), mobility trends shows driving activity has rebounded substantially.

Based on preliminary data provided by the company, attendance levels are already back to 85% of 2019 levels (or 90% when adjusted for park capacity constraints in Canada) in the first 10 weeks of 3Q-21. This is in light of rising COVID cases so even if you are personally concerned about the Delta variant, the data shows that the American consumer is largely not. Management has also noted that they have not seen any impact from the Delta variant in aggregate or when comparing parks. While other leisure activities have seen changes in consumer behavior, the company believes the fact that their experience is predominantly outdoors makes it less risky, which could be mitigating any impact, given its core demographic are families.

I believe that improved vaccination trends and fewer COVID cases in 2022 coupled with pent-up demand should result in robust attendance recovery next year. Historically, attendance per avg. park per day has grown at a 4.8% CAGR (2011 thru 2019) and should generally track population growth, all-else being equal. I have not assumed any increased attendance beyond 2019 levels however.

#### 2. FUN will be able to hold revenue per capita going forward

Historically, growth in guest spend per capita has been tepid, growing at a 1.5% CAGR (2011-2019) to $45.41 vs. $40.43 in 2011. However, the company is currently seeing spending per person that is \~20% higher vs. 2019 levels with in-park spend per capita at $62.81 in the first 10 weeks of 3Q-21. Food/merchandise spending is up 35% and ticket prices are up 15% compared to 2019 levels. Even with slightly lower attendance, the higher per capita spend is translating to higher revenues with the most recent preliminary figures suggesting a 3% increase over 2019.

The key debate now is whether “per caps” can scale with higher attendance and whether they will hold next year. On the first point, preliminary 3Q-21 results have pretty definitively answered that per caps can indeed hold during peak demand. On the second point, I believe FUN will be able to hold these going forward. Part of the reason is because operators have historically been fearful of dramatically raising prices due to the potential impact on consumer experience. However, under the guise of COVID, management has been able to test these higher price points largely because they did not have a choice.

Prior to the pandemic, FUN was already pivoting to an events strategy to both broaden the customer base and to drive urgency of existing customers to visit the park. As part of the strategy, the company began upgrading its food &amp; beverage (F&amp;B) offering by investing in culinary talent, building more facilities, and improving throughput. The pandemic has only strengthened management’s view that this strategy is needed, noting the \~20%+ increase in revenue per capita was driven to a large degree by strength in-park with stronger F&amp;B. What makes large price increases possible is the fact that the consumer is essentially a hostage once they’re in the park. Additional contribution to stability of per caps is due to management’s recent elimination of discount distribution channels, institution of dynamic pricing in-park, and investment in facilities to drive capacity / transactions.

Ultimately, visiting a theme park remains of the best price/value offerings for the leisure consumer in the United States. When factoring in that the typical park is open for 10-12 hours a day during the season, this further highlights the value that parks provide consumers, even when factoring in likely expenditures on parking and F&amp;B. This compares with sporting events or movie theaters, where the experience may only last two to four hours on average. This suggests there is quite some room for guest spend per capita to increase from current elevated levels, both from a ticket price and in-park spend perspective.

#### 3. Labor issues will normalize and margins should exceed pre-COVID levels:

With revenues likely to rebound stronger post-pandemic, the offsetting concern has been labor shortages and the resulting rise in labor costs. During the 2Q-21 earnings call, the CEO stated the seasonal labor rate was 40% higher vs. 2019 levels and that it was one of “most challenging environments he’s seen in over 30 years.” The company has even had to reduce the number of operating days in 2021 due to staffing issues. As an industry, hourly labor represents around 15-18% of revenues. Nonetheless, there are several compounding effects here which make me believe this is transitory and will largely normalize in 2022.

First, a large portion of its seasonal labor force comprises high school/college students. This pool of labor has been dwindled due to (1) COVID-related health concerns and ability to get vaccines, (2) continued unemployment benefits which discouraged labor force participation, and (3) FUN deciding to start its season much later vs. competitors, which limited the labor pool even further. I believe all of these are largely transitory and will normalize next year.

Second, FUN heavily relies on the national J-1 visa program to bring foreign students to work in America for four months each year. The travel restriction posed by the worldwide pandemic has affected that program for two summers now; however, the corresponding visa ban has recently been lifted — you can learn more [here](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/april-sees-end-to-work-visa-ban-9775902/). This is not a FUN-specific issue and given its recent expiry, I believe this pool of labor should largely be accessible next year. As long as there more young foreign workers willing to come to the US to earn an above-average USD-denominated salary, wage/labor cost increases should naturally be capped due to basic supply/demand.

Lastly, the company is striving to offset labor inﬂation and shortages with additional efficiencies and automation efforts. To cover the incremental labor pressures, FUN has been able to identify greater procurement savings and anticipates even further upside could be possible from iterations of new pricing tools. The company is planning to retain a larger portion of their work force for year-around operations to improve operating efficiencies and ensure business continuity. Generally speaking, the theme park has high annual churn in its labor force and given this turnover, the labor issue should subside by next year.

 

#### 4. The combination of higher revenues and normalized labor costs should translate to above-consensus EBITDA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v6v6ib479wm71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da826c4ae473d27700776cf5380dd0070d94e963

 

### Expected Returns:

$650mm 2022E EBITDA (rounded down) at 10x should translate to \~$70/unit. The stock may trade sideways in-line with re-opening beta but quarterly earnings should provide valuation support. I think the initiation of a distribution beginning in 2H-22 could potentially re-rate the stock higher, particularly because the FCF yield is relatively high and below its historical levels (10-year (pre-COVID) median of 17x).

Historical multiples may not be appropriate due to increasing season pass holder penetration which adds stability to the business. As noted earlier, season passholders typically go 3-4x per year. If the company can build upon this and create a more sizeable network effect across its parks like MTN did, we could potentially see some modest multiple expansion. While not my base case, any re-rating in the market multiple is highly accretive given the leverage here.

Picture memes are lazy and are for lesser Subs. Some of the apes on here are really creative and put their heart and soul into making video masterpieces. It's a shame that a repost of a picture from a successful Instagram meme passes through the mods and become trending instantly. It's not surprising because pictures load faster, don't require an attention span(which apes lack), and are instantly understood.

While on the other hand, videos which take hours of hard work get swept under the algorithm because it's impossible to compete with the 3 points I mentioned. In addition, the videos which do survive the algorithm are usually very short, or are actually a static picture with sounds, and there is a reason for that... It's because that content is permitted and is rewarded in the current inferior MEME meta, and the community is now conditioned to this type of content making them appreciate this garbage.

I hope that the Mods reinstate the ""No picture MEMES"" rule so that this community's quality doesn't decrease. When the standards are high, the community is forced to push itself to create better and better content. Moreover, when better content is the standard, bs pictures and static videos will be frowned upon by the community and won't be upvoted anymore and the algorithm will sweep them under the rug where they belong without a Mod needing to lift a finger.

Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company which has a drug against Lupus Nephritis

&amp;nbsp;

**The** **basics** 

- First FDA-approved oral therapy for lupus nephritis. Only competitor is Benlysta from GSK, less efficient, injection only (more painful for the patient)

- The Lupus Foundation of America estimates 1.5 million Americans have lupus, Studies have shown that over time up to 60% of lupus patients will develop lupus nephritis, including over half of children with lupus.

- 65k annual revenue is expected per lupus nephritis patient.

- AUPH has no debt and, even better, 400 millions in cash.

- Good market penetration so far (100 patients Q1, 400 Q2) and guidance provided for the end of the year (40-50 millions) with great expectations for the next years (200 in 2022, 400 in 2023, sales peak at 1.5 billions) 

- Partnership with Otsuka for the Europe / Japan markets (up to 20% of the sales + 100 millions cash)

- Analysts consensus is at 28+, buyout above 45.

Pre Q2, the question was to know if they would be able to sell it and the stock was really pressured because of that (low after Q1 at 10, then 3 top at 14), now we know it is most likely the case and that's why the SP is getting higher (+50% in the past month), institutions are buying (Morgan Stanley went from 300k to 3 millions shares for example) and it seems unlikely it will ever go back below 14. 

https://i.imgur.com/jM8aDgo.png

https://i.imgur.com/nGyc3pm.png

&amp;nbsp;

**The** **catalysts**

- Aurinia 2 (3 years / 36 months studies) will be released by end of the year, knowing nothing bad was detected at 33 months, that should validate it as SOC (Standard of Care).

- Europe approval process has been started in June, with an expected approval next year.

- They just bought 2 new drugs for their pipeline which could synergize well with Lupkynis.

- Q3 results early November should validate the trend of sales. 

- Aurinia sued Sun Pharmaceuticals over pattern infringement in December 2020, this should be resolved in a near future and bring more liquidity to the company. 

- High short interest and huge calls volume

&amp;nbsp;

**The** **buyout**

All of that just if the company goes by itself. But the cherry on top would be to get bought out by one of the Big Pharm and it seems likely to happen in the next months. In this case, we should expect at least a 150/200% premium.

- AUPH delisted itself from the Toronto exchange, officially because only 6% of the shares traded were traded there. But it also simplifies the process of being bought out. 

- First rumors back in May / June (Pfizer, GSK, AstraZeneca...) 

- M&amp;A season started some weeks ago with TRIL / Pfizer, Sanofi bought Kadmon, etc... AUPH is one of the best candidate for the big pharmas. 

- A weird Press Release appeared a couple of weeks ago on different websites, about a 35+ acquisition by a big pharma, it was later asked to be removed by the company from Benzinga.

&amp;nbsp;

**The** **short** **interest**

Since the FDA Approval in Jan 2021, the stock has been pressured by the shorts. Honestly, it was not dumb from them because even with an approved drug, there are LOT of reason a biotech can fail. 

From 5 millions post approval, they went up to 16 millions pre Q2 results, and had to add another million post Q2 to keep the SP low. We talk about 17.6 millions shares, about 13% of the float!! With the current run (13% in one week, 30% last month), 99% of the shorts are already in the red.

Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen and Kroger chairmen’s had this to comment on the companies outlook for long-term sustainable growth.
“Our strategic focus on leading with fresh and accelerating with digital continues to build momentum across our business. Kroger’s seamless ecosystem is working. This was evident during the quarter as we saw customers seamlessly shift between channels, and we continued to see strong digital engagement. Customers are eating more food at home because it is more affordable, convenient, and healthier than other options.
“Our associates continue to support our customers and our communities through the pandemic by delivering a full, fresh, and friendly experience every day. We are committed to our environmental, social, and governance strategy to advance positive outcomes for people and our planet and create more resilient global systems, driven by our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan.
“We are leveraging technology, innovation, and our competitive moats to deliver against the initiatives outlined at our 2021 investor day, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.”

While Kroger’s shares dipped down and rose back up on September 9ths trading day, Kroger is expecting a better second quarter then originally thought and furthermore has shown massive growth on a year to date basis.
A pretty obvious thing to assume if you ask me. With the lockdowns and the pandemic starting back in 2020 it’s pretty obvious that people got a lot more familiar with their local grocery store since it was one of the few places that people could actually go when they had to leave their homes to buy food.
Obviously this is why Kroger’s outlook is so positive and I would be inclined to agree with them.

So will it go up or down?

My guess is that Kroger will see a slight dip as earlier investors take out their profits and by mid day we should see a nice upward trend. Another way it could go is by shooting up in premarket and by opening shooting back down as investors take a quick and easy profit and then again by midday leveling out in a upward trend. Again this is pure speculation, no one can accurately predict the market every time but I do have a feeling that this one is kind of a no brainer.",wallstreetbets,Kroger looks at a bright future as second quarter earnings come out,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/plkpat/kroger_looks_at_a_bright_future_as_second_quarter/

For those of you getting your short interest information from Fintel, Fintel sources their data from Capital IQ and says they update twice a month, which happens to be today for the next update. Im willing to bet Fintel will report this high SI  tonight.

Also, on yahoo finance, the Shares short is being reported as 4.18 and the Free float is being reported as 2.45M as well. Although the Shares Outstanding calculation has changed since Aug 13th, since the data sources like Capital IQ have updated their Float calculation to take out Bath and Body Works' 80M stake out of the free float. The Short % of Float number is just reflective of the data on August 13th, and the Float number has changed since then. Next short interest reporting date is today. It should be updated to reflect current float calculations then.

I am 30 y/o and used to fap multiple times a day because my wife’ s boyfriend won’ t let me touch my wife, so I have to spend most of the time with my left hand (yes left handed).

There’ s only one problem I must face: I can only fap on my own loss porn. I mean really, I have tried a lot of different styles and other people’ s loss porn but it just never feels as familiar and intimate as with my own.

It has gotten such a bad addiction that I have to lose a lot of money at least 3 times a day for not stacking too much blood in my penis.

This is the whole reason I came to WSB in the first place because I thought apes here will help me out for sure. On my journey to find some huge losses I immediately bought some GME at $50. I was very disappointed by the performance and not turned on at all so I had to sell it at $350 and went on to buy puts in order to finally lose some money. Unfortunately, the price went down and I won again.

At this point in time my dick was so hard that I really had to print some losses so I could finally release some pressure. I doubled down my GSAT positions at $1, and put the rest into TSLA calls because betting against Michael Burry would lose me money for sure right?

Wrong again, Papa Musk and some shit rumors that happened over there at Apple pushed prices up again. I had to close my positions in green again to reduce opportunity cost by saving time to find something where I could lose money and finally finish off my job.

I am very desperate and depressed right now, since I’ m on WSB I’ ve only won money and did not lose a single dollar.

My last hope is reaching out to the biggest loss porn experts in here for advice of how I can start losing again to rub one off.

Overview:

[Description](https://preview.redd.it/le7i3eo65ik71.png?width=1675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=834ff3463b926507897f779f3492338f06f3df16)

""Harsco Corporation is an industrial services and engineered products company. The company offers industrial mill services, gas control, and containment products, scaffolding services, and railway maintenance. Harsco is also involved in other lines of business including process equipment, industrial grating and bridge decking, pipe fittings, slag abrasives, and roof granules. 

Harsco is a market-leading, global provider of environmental solutions for industrial and specialty waste streams, and innovative equipment and technology for the rail sector. The company works with energy, steel, and construction companies to find new uses for their waste or to dispose of it. It takes, for example, power-plant coal slag and turns it into industrial abrasives. Other reprocessed materials are fertilizer, asphalt, and roofing granules. Harsco's railway business makes track maintenance equipment, collision avoidance and warning systems, and other equipment as well as provides rail maintenance services. In recent years, Harsco has reshaped itself through acquisitions and divestitures. More than 40% of the Pennsylvania-based company's revenue comes from the US.

Harsco has operated through three businesses, Harsco Environmental, Harsco Rail, and Harsco Clean Earth. Harsco Environmental, about 70% of sales, provides on-site services for materials logistics and product-quality improvement, and resources recovery from iron, steel, and metals manufacturing as well as value-added environmental services for industrial co-products. The Clean Earth segment, about 10% of revenue, provides processing and beneficial reuse solutions for hazardous waste, contaminated materials, and dredged volumes through its more than 25 facilities in about 15 states. Harsco Rail, about 15% of revenue, makes and sells railway track maintenance equipment and track maintenance services. Some 40% of its revenue comes from aftermarket sales and about 50% is from original equipment sales.""

Analysts expect Harsco to grow its EPS significantly over the next 2 years.

[Default Risk](https://preview.redd.it/abaywevt8ik71.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0729560b0c46192d88774a1669f07bfcd7155220)

Bloomberg's default risk model gives Harsco a relatively high chance of defaulting in the next year.

 

[Credit Rating](https://preview.redd.it/1f0murb09ik71.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fc0c4367bc448624d6af65bcda3f6396118866f)

Harsco has a very poor credit rating as they needed to take out a lot of debt to fund acquisitions.

 

[Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/yw4mhf699ik71.png?width=1340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab28564e0af33b4897dc9dd756b5063ff99f87c2)

Harsco's short interest is high, meaning the company is being significantly shorted. Typically a company that has a short interest ratio between 1 and 4 indicates a strong positive sentiment about its stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

From 2019 to 2020, Harsco's Clean Earth segment went from 11% to 33% of total revenue, a 366% increase. This was because of successful acquisitions made in 2019 that were integrated extremely well into the company. Managements successful track record of acquisitions and their strong insider sentiment are pivotal to earnings estimates.

Harsco is trading at a discounted EV/EBITDA compared to its peers. A correction of this discrepancy will be used to calculated the terminal value, adjusting the multiple to 14.

&amp;#x200B;

[WACC](https://preview.redd.it/gz88mrkrbik71.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c127ca1a33839f60af3784c4e9211ed220f863)

Being a highly leveraged company, Harsco has a significantly high default spread and WACC.

Projections for Revenue, EBIT, and D&amp;A in 2021 and 2022 were taken from Bloomberg. The 2023 numbers were then based off historical averages. CAPEX, CA, and CL were projected forward using their correlations to revenue.

Using an 11 year DCF with the assumptions of 7% annual growth and a 7% operating margin, both slightly less than their historical average, the fair value range can be narrowed down. Noting this, I would put the range of returns at 84%-120%. It would also make sense to assume a higher WACC as interest rates are bound to increase soon, and the two have a direct relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outlook:

Harsco's experienced management team have a solid track record of effectively integrating acquisitions. As the company has shifted from its initial railroad focus to waste management, it has taken on large debt loads to fund its acquisitions. While total debt has increased  from $845 Million to $1.435 Billion from Q1 2020 to Q2 2021, the EBITDA interest expense coverage has risen from 3.45 to 5.35. With high inflation coming, this coverage will likely continue to rise significantly.

**I Highly recommend reading Part 1 first.**

# (Important Part and TLDR)

 Since my first $ASTS DD, The stock went up 30%, but it's still no where near the valuation it deserves. The potential upside of ASTS is comparable to $TSLA in its 50$s(post split) and this is an understatement. At a valuation of 2.09 Billion(now), a **10-100X increase in valuation**(stock price) is not far away from reality, if everything goes to plan. This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity which for me deserves the risk (The risk of it going to 0$ if shit hits the fan or going to **200$+**).

 One thing that ASTS has recently shown, **which ClOV failed to do**, is that **it's not a pump and dump scheme.** When it shot up, it stayed up and for me that shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

 In this DD, I'm going to answer the questions of the skeptics in my previous DD. Since this is a speculative play, skepticism is healthy especially when the stock is in it's very early stages. We definitely don't want this to become the next $NKLA...

***Q1-"" 5G can only go 1500 feet tops. So, any claims to be anything more than 4G is fake physics sentimentalization..."" by*** *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho) 

&gt;**TLDR; The 1500 Feet figure was brought up by Google searchs smart answer and was pulled up from a Verizon post. Long story short, this doesn't apply to LEO satellite technology used by AST Spacemobile.**

A:   First, **5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics,** and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  **ASTS is planning to use its partner’s CELLULAR spectrum,** which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears. 

Second, Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEO satellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth’s orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position. 

 In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.

 Unlike Geostationary Orbits (GEO), LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth’s surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth’s surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth’s surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.

 Now AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (“FoV”) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.

 Each satellite may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.

 The same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a “break -then- make ” approach.

# How Apples rumor plays into this? (VERY BULLISH)

 IPhone 13 is rumored to contain a chip with increased satellite connectivity capabilities, Qualcomm Snapdragon x60. In addition, There is a 3GPP release 16 chip that has been available to OEM(original equipment manufacturer) phone makers since the beginning of this year and it will be in phones starting early 2022. This chip is designed by Qualcomm and it is called x65. Moreover, it is manufactured by AST SpaceMobile's partner Samsung. This chip is the worlds first chip to fully implement 3GPP release 16. 

Why is it important?

 It will feature enhanced beamhandling capabilities, 4x4 MIMO, and an increased satellite connectivity. 

 **That is very bullish because it shows that Cell phone makers are already getting ready to connect even better to AST SpaceMobile constellation.**

***Q2- ""No fuckin way they pull that off with a 10m2 sat with any sizeable number of users..."" by***  *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho) 

&gt;**TLDR; AST SpaceMobile is planning to have enormous satellites with a cross section of 450m2.**

 The large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**

 In addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:

* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.
* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.
* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.

 So, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.

Now for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc . 

 Now the numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June ""Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"". The technology works and the numbers are impressive. 

***Q3- ""What kind of lag is there to get this data from low earth orbit? Streaming is one thing, gaming is another. I'm curious what the latency would be."" by u/***[*mbr4life1*](https://www.reddit.com/user/mbr4life1/)

&gt;**TLDR; LEO satellites have a low latency 25-35ms.** 

 This question of latency is key. Some geostationary satellites at 35,786 km already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‘hop’ away, then the delay is multiplied. 

 Now on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!

***Q4- ""Starlink will be a direct competitor by 2025"" by u/***[***MaximumRecording1170***](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaximumRecording1170/) 

&gt;**TLDR; Short answer is no.**

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :  

 Yes, AST will be a fierce competitor  to Starlink as AST can do fixed cellular broadband at much lower customer acquisition cost. So they’ll be the prefered choice in  developing world and for low traffic applications in developed world.

 But, no, Starlink will not compete with AST in AST core market. Which is  connecting directly to unmodified cellular phones.  This is because Starlink uses high band spectrum that has poor distance and propagation characteristics, which requires users to 1) buy a large dish antenna that is fixed in position and 2) have a clear line of sight to the satellite. 

***Q5- ""******How can phone signals reach the satellite given the strength of a regular handset?, How much is it affected by the weather?"" by u/***[XinjDK](https://www.reddit.com/user/XinjDK/)

 *Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :  

* Gainforming. It is a bit like beamforming but it optimizes the gain of the electronically steered antenna.
* the cellular bands used for fronthaul (phone-satellite) are not affected by weather. The v-band used for backhaul (satellite to terrestrial ground  station / switch hooked up with terrestrial cellular network) is susceptible to rain attenuation. This is solved by having powerful antennas in both ends to overcome that attenuation. (If need be, several  alternative terrestrial sites within the FoV of satellite could be  used. To circumvent very heavy rainfalls. No such tweak has been  communicated by company though.)

***Q6- A very frequent question, Why is this ticker allowed on WSB? Doesn't have a small market cap? u/***[Oxianas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oxianas/) u/[Momoselfie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Momoselfie/)

WSB doesn't tolerate BS aka SPACS, Crypt0, and Market caps &lt;1.5 Billion. At the time of my first post, the market cap of ASTS was 1.7 Billion. 

Some brokers, such as TD Ameritrade, brings up only Class A share Data. That's why some people get confused with the market cap. 

The A,B, and C class shares were worth 1.7 Billion at the time of my first post.

***Q7- Is there a partnership between SpaceX and AST Spacemobile? by u/***[***carsonthecarsinogen***](https://www.reddit.com/user/carsonthecarsinogen/) 

 BlueWalker 3(ASTS Satellite) is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in March 2022. The spacecraft has an aperture of 693  square feet and is designed to communicate directly with cell phones via 3GPP standard frequencies. 

***Q8- How could anyone possibly know that? 6G is still in development. by u/*** [The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

 AST SpaceMobile Leo Satellites don't do onboard processing. They’re bent pipe architecture so they’re forward compatible with any protocols being carried on cellular spectrum.  As long as future protocols incorporate cellular spectrum, any future 6G, 7G, etc can be supported. 

***Q9- Get ready to get diluted to hell when VC gets called back in after the stock gets pumped. by u/***[The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

*answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) with edits : 

The owner/partners (Cisneros, American Tower, Vodafone, Samsung, and Rakuten) will provide non-dillutive funding options once equatorial satellites are deployed (and that  one is fully funded).

The risk of  public offerings/dilllution risk should not be exaggerated. If equatorial constellation succeeds it will open up huge positive cashflows. And to aquire non-dillutive bridging financing from owners and/or banks to expand the constellation quicker will most likely be no problem at that point.

Finally, the company can cash settle its warrants once the stock price trades above $18 for 20/30 trading days.  This would bring in $11.50 x 17.6M public/private warrants = $202 million in capital.

***Q10- ""Pump  &amp; dump warning on this company guys. They just hyping a technology  that doesn't exist yet, no heavy institutions supporting them and mostly  owned by private stakeholders. If you really want to YOLO just short it  before it drops."" by***  [Same-Seaworthiness20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Same-Seaworthiness20/) 

15 days later, and it didn't dump. For me, this shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

No institutional support? Now this is straight up BS! Rakuten(Big japanese telecom), ATT, Vodafone, and American Towers all have a position in it. Go to Fintel to see all the institutional investors. According to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don’t think that they would’ve invested if they didn’t see a proof of concept.

MeLongYouLongTime,t2_wrvna,1631197159,pkyq64,True,84,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pkyq64/stop_buying_dumpster_fires_and_buy_aso/,1,"I’ve refrained from writing a post here on my position in ASO for a while because I don’t want to peddle my shit  and turn this thing into a meme stock (or do i) but I feel like I’d be doing a disservice to my fellow retards by not sharing a major value story here with y’all. GME made me more money than I've ever had, so I hope this can do something like that for some of yall, truly. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Quick Pitch

ASO is at a P/E ratio of 6.6 -7, with revenue $6+ billion, increasing margins and more profitable than ever, amarket cap of only $3.5b and their debt load being dramatically reduced ahead of schedule. Heavily owned by institutions, KKR dramatically reducing their majority shareholder % to now only 20%. A share repurchase program for $500mil and a lot of insider buying and Ken Hicks who turned Footlocker around took their share price straight up…. How and why are people you guys not buying this up? This 6% dip this morning is probably the best value you can get on the market. Its pretty much an anomaly in today’s market climate. 

DKS (Dicks sporting goods) PE ratio is at a 11/12. If ASO was adjusted to just a PE of 9 they would be somewhere around $58.00 a share which is a 45% increase from where we are at today. 9 is extremely fair. As the best and most efficient retailor in the market they should be a 15 or $85 a share. 

ASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors, is massively undervalued compared to its peers and it is the best player in the space. Why aren’t retail investors piling into this for locked  gains has me confused? It’s a real company with real customers that are loyal and lifers of Academy, many have been shopping there since they were kids and now it’s where they shop for their kids.  My guess is investors see Covid days as good as it’s going to get for Academy, but the reopening is proving to be even bigger and permanent than expected.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’s important to know where Academy stores are located and who they serve. Academy has 259 mostly in the Southeast. They are a low/mid cost sports and outdoors retailer. Think youth sports, gym clothes, and camping/fishing /hunting gear. Their stores are often the only specialty retailer in a suburban area and some more heavily populated areas where ASO and Dicks compete (and in those area ASO wins every time). Their customers tend to be more blue-collar simpler consumers who would rather touch and feel the products vs order online for convenience, even though online sales have picked up drastically recently. Not having a strong online presence is not something that should turn you away from this stock. Nobody buys fishing equipment, camping gear, your child’s sports equipment online, these are things you want to touch and feel and try on and especially with this crowd of consumers.

Like I said I think investors look at covid lockdowns as if it were ASO’s best days, in fact I think this is why KKR ultimately decided to take them public after seeing 2 monster quarters back-to-back, they knew their valuation would be higher than it’s ever been and thought better take advantage of this fluke. I believe retailers are valued at IPO on their previous 2 quarters. But they didn’t expect to keep having monster record earnings afterwards so turns out they jumped the gun. Here’s why it will continue at least for a couple more quarters. Q2 last year we were completely shut down, sure exercise equipment and bike sales were through the roof, but youth sports and other sections came to a screeching halt. Now you have a massive reopening trade that will last a couple quarters longer as kids get back to each of their respective sports (each season) after a year hiatus and adults get back to their hobbies. Kids grow fast and I’m predicting this sector of the business will be on fire for a bit as parents have to replace outgrown equipment. This should bring more traffic to their stores than ever Academy is doing well and will continue to do well because they have a massive loyal following in the South with a product mix that’s borderline recession proof and mostly resilient to online retailers.

Comps

21’ Guidance compared to 19’ Pre-Covid

\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $120,000,000 in 2019– increase of 352%

\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from $4.8B in 2019 – increase of 35% 

\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $1.60 – increase of 252%

21’ guidance compared to 20’ numbers (keep in mind 20’ was thought to be their record fluke sales year)

\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $309,000,000 in 2020 – increase of 76%

\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from 5.689B in 2020 – increase of 15%

\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $3.79 in 2020 – increase of 48%

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Other bullish indicators

\-  Gross margin increased 29.4% to $642.5 million, the highest quarterly gross profit in the Company's history. The gross margin rate improved by 500 basis points to 35.9%. This growth was primarily driven by stronger merchandise margins from a favorable product mix shift, higher average unit retails and less promotional activity.

\-  The company also took steps to enhance its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $553.8 million with no outstanding balance on its credit facility. Adjusted free cash flow was $169.5 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24.0% compared to the prior year quarter and 3.2% compared to Q1 2021.

\-  Academy's largest shareholder (KKR) completed two transactions, reducing their ownership to approximately 20% of the Company as of the end of the quarter.

\-  As part of one of these events, Academy purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million.

\-  In addition to the stock repurchase, the Company paid down $99 million of its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%. Based on these positive actions, S&amp;P (B+ from B) and Moody's (Ba3 from B1) both upgraded the Company's debt rating.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Im long 6,350 shares at $37.30 basis. 

I'll let others talk about the Short Interest attached to ASO and any potential squeezes. I think its a buy  with easy 50-100% upside regardless of any of that. That would all be bonus. But if this thing does move to $50-$55 quickly it could really trap some of the shorts and gap up pretty quickly.

Quick summary, I made a post indicating that all the CLOV posts are sketchy and that this was most likely a discord P&amp;D.

I did this to try and help people be aware of this specific sequence of events.

Mod came in made a nice comment acknowledging the fact and even made second comment as a joke. In 2 hours that post had like 2.1k upvotes and like 20+ awards. By hour 3 a mod took the post down for now reason. Didn’t provide me shit as to why it was taken down.

I made a second post about literally what I wrote above. Within a few seconds that post was taken down and I got a 1 day ban. Again, no reason as to why it was removed.

Yet, WSB let the fleury of sketchy CLOV post filter right on by and let those post stay on WSB. Yet, took mine down which was genuine sentiment and had received good traction from the community.

Now, what happened to CLOV? As per my original post, it was a BS P&amp;D based on a Wells Fargo conference today?

Like this shit was so obvious. Anyways WSB (The mod who took my shit down and entertained this BS).

$HIMS likely to be on a run-rate of more than $300 million by Q4 2021, to just be burning through $15 million per quarter isn't much at all, considering the amount of investment that's required to grow consumer awareness of its brand.

# The Sector:

Telemedicine has exploded since the COVID plandemic has hit. People are realizing not only do you not have to work from home, but you can get most of your basic health needs done from the tap of a few buttons rather than in a waiting room. Sure, if you have a rash on your junk, you should probably see a doctor. But hey, if you want to kick it up a notch with the ladies... Hydrate your skin or just consider getting some more of your hair back.. Why would you walk into an office? This sector is growing at such a rapid pace, it's going to become more normal than a specialty. Kind of like.. you know calling someone versus texting someone.  


# The looks of the company:

If you look at the marketing and branding, they feel young and fresh. Partnering with people like Gronk (Bucs player) / Miley Cyrus (singer) and the look/appeal of the website reminds me a lot of what brought a lot of success to companies like Lululemon, or hell even Apple if you want to go that far. Keep it clean, keep it simple. They are focused on a target that uses phones as part of their daily ritual. A target that uses TikTok/IG for advice versus listening to the boomers at the dinner table.  


# End thoughts:

While I don't know if the stock will ultimately go up, i do believe at this price... the risk is well worth the reward. It won't rocket like $GME/$AMC on some meme dream, but if you hold it for a while we could see a similar pattern to what happened with $TDOC. I have no gay bear thesis here, because we all know stonks only go up.

As we continue to develop new capabilities, I think our doctors will find them incredibly valuable when managing their Clover patients.”",wallstreetbets,New News: Clover Assistant Now Supports All FHIR-Enabled EHRs Extremely Bullish!,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pka6ib/new_news_clover_assistant_now_supports_all/

Again, these are **randomly** selected time series grouped together.

**Only astrologists and fortune-tellers can make sense of macroeconomic trends.**

Let's begin with this one:

Allright, that was fun. 

**WARNING: This is not financial advice. I am neither a landscaper nor a musician!**

If you wanna know the fraction of foreign revenue of all revenue in the index, it's roghly 30% in current years:

This really makes me feel better. Btw, if you choose to index at 1960, it does not look much different.

**WARNING, again: This is not financial advice. I am neither a bartender nor a dermatologist!**

Great, I like that. 

Since I was in the mood, I also randomly compared these two and played around a little with text boxes and forms and stuff:

It seems that price to earnings ratio exploded AFTER bubble bursts, due to earnings crashes that follow the burst, while in the run-up to the burst the picture is mixed. I found interesting that the ratio declined one year ahead of the dotcom bubble burst, somehow catching up with valuations.

Don’t you HATE how your wife’s boyfriend calls YOU a cuuck?

Well... after SENS, you can fire him and become your OWN wife’s boyfriend! Doesn’t it sound nice to have her ALL to yourself?

Now that I got your smooth-brained attention, let me explain why SENS is going to the FUCKING MOOON  


**About the Company:**

This play is NOT based around the fundamental value of SENS, but it is important to know what the company is before investing

SENS designs and manufactures Glucose monitoring systems. Their flagship device goes under the skin and transmits data to their app in real time! Their accuracy in real-time monitoring is revolutionary, especially considering that their newest transmitter lasts up to 180 days

They are currently awaiting FDA approval on the 180 day sensor, but have cleared most major regulatory hurdles

Knowing that they are creating a good product clears some of the risk

OK now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me show you the REAL fun!  


**Options Market:**

Sens has an INSANELY bullish options market with a put/call ratio of 0.2! This means that for every put, there are 5 MORE call options purchased!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2l7f1dhs5am71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48899e2ecf89dd2705d9996efc900c9e89f86a6

EVEN including meme stocks, this is the HIGHEST P/C ratio I have EVER SEEN

A high open interest and P/C ratio mean two things; the market thinks this stock will go up, and this has a potential for a gamma squeeze

The open interest on just 9/17 expiry is INSANE

https://preview.redd.it/ui55d21u5am71.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600508d2ac83260cfba660b4da4652452967eb0f

This means that ANY increase in IV or price of the underlying stock will lead to MM’s purchasing a shit ton of shares to ‘gamma hedge’ to stay delta-neutral, which in turn will lead to a chain reaction of MM’s buying shares to hedge which causes the price and IV to increase further

Every stock/option you buy will be multiplied by this effect, giving you a MUCH larger influence over the price of the stock

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Interest:**

Despite making a good product and having an insanely bullish options market, shorts have over-shorted this stock up to 30% SI!

https://preview.redd.it/1setq0yv5am71.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=889840adc77bcbb2250f1dd1e7891f5c4372dbb8

Additionally, over the past few weeks about 45% of the daily volume has been sold short

https://preview.redd.it/4gmvqiqw5am71.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754d41ce9b3c815b5c9e52fb3c8a12a2d25ca1c3

These numbers alone don’t necessarily mean shorts will cover their positions… But if you include the bullish options market, which is primed for a gamma squeeze, and a potential FDA approval, you begin to see why shorts are fucked and will begin to close their positions soon. All this stock needs is a catalyst...  


**Possible Catalysts:**

The main catalyst I see for a short squeeze is full FDA approval on their 180 day sensor. Once it is approved, many shorts who were betting on the company going bankrupt will get out

A few shorts covering mixed with such high open interest and new investors getting in will lead to a massive price spike and the potential to trigger margin calls on over-leveraged short positions

The more likely situation I see though is an immediate spike followed by slow exits from short positions. I don’t see a massive M O A S S happening, but instead steady upwards momentum as shorts close their positions

I see the 180 day sensor being approved within the next 1-2 months as their 90 day sensor has already been cleared awhile ago and their 180 day sensor has cleared most regulatory requirements already  


**Positions:**

10 $3.5 C 9/17, 10 $4 C 9/17, 20 $4.5 C 9/17, 20 $5 C 9/17, 10 $3.5 C 10/15, 8 $4 C 10/15, 20 $4.5 C 10/15 100 shares  


**TLDR:**

The legal process for the trademark dispute of anti-rust liquid products between the WD40 and Get All 40, which has been running for more than a year, is still ongoing. Get All 40 will appeal to the Supreme Court for the decision of the Central Jakarta District Court of Niaga Judges which is considered not to apply the principle of justice and seems reckless.

&amp;#x200B;

The feud began in 2015 when WD40 filed a lawsuit for the cancellation of the Get All 40 certificate to the level of the Supreme Court (MA). However, Get All 40 managed to reclaim its rights through the Intellectual Property Rights Appeal Commission (HAKI) by taking advantage of the issuance of PP 10 of 2019, concerning Procedures for Appealing Marks in Intellectual Property Rights.

After getting the certificate back, on August 18, 2020, Benny Bong as the owner of the Get All 40 trademark sued for compensation to WD40.

The trial of the lawsuit was submitted on August 6, 2021. However, on January 5, 2021, WD40 through its attorney Hadiputranto, Hadinoto &amp; Partner (HHP) filed a lawsuit against the cancellation of the Get All 40 certificate as previously done on January 5, 2021, then the Panel of Judges granted WD40 lawsuit with decision Number 03/Pdt.Sus-Merek/2021/PN.Niaga.Jkt.Pst on August 25th, however, the decision of the Panel of Judges led by Dulhusin,SH,MH was considered legally flawed, reckless and not based on the principles of justice. and propriety, legal defects due to the shortcomings of the parties.

Benny Bong as the owner of the Get All 40 trademark felt that the court’s decision had violated the law and the process was not based on the principle of justice, “All the defenses that we submitted were not taken into consideration. The Panel of Judges only refers to the arguments presented by the plaintiffs,” said Benny Bong to a number of media crews on Monday (6/9/2021).

This businessman who was once a WD40 dealer suspected that there was a ‘game’ behind the decision,

While the testimony of expert witness Dr. Suyud Margono, SH., MHum., FCIArb. The panel of judges who said there was no similarity were ignored by the panel of judges. “Pak Suyud is the most expert in the field of trademarks. But his statement was not taken into consideration,” said Benny Bong.

Benny Bong deeply regrets the attitude of law enforcement officers who do not take sides with local entrepreneurs who are struggling to create domestic products to be able to compete with imported products. “Even President Jokowi has repeatedly said that we love domestic products,” he said.

The same thing was conveyed by Chandra Suwono, a businessman and chairman of the HWI Lintedeves Market Cooperative. According to him, there has been injustice against local entrepreneurs, as well as playing around with the law in Indonesia by foreign businessmen with WD 40, because the panel of judges is of the opinion that WD40 is a large company, registered worldwide.

“But we should refer to the law in Indonesia. Indonesian products must be supported by all Indonesian people, including law enforcement officers. The President himself supports domestic products, “said Chandra.

Chandra suspects that there are big powers who deliberately make efforts with all events to play with the law in Indonesia and try to shut down domestic production. “We should support Get All 40 as a domestic product so that it can compete in the global world,” said Chandra.

In the absence of legal certainty, according to Chandra, the business world, especially domestic production, will be left hanging, because it is attacked by large outside parties.

From that decision, we should suspect that there has been a legal affair. In addition to making an appeal to the Supreme Court, I will also complain to Commission III of the DPR, the Judicial Commission, and the KPK to oversee the next legal process, Chandra said.

As the attorney for Get All 40, Djamhur, S.H, he has many notes that will be written down in the memory of the appeal later. There are several important points that weaken the decision, such as the lack of parties and the validity of the legal standing.

According to Djamhur, in their consideration regarding the lack of parties, the Panel of Judges said that it was the right of the plaintiff’s initiative to determine which parties would be sued in accordance with the jurisprudence of Supreme Court Decision No. 546K/Sip/1970 issued on 28 October 1970.

“It turned out that after I checked, the Supreme Court Decree No. 546 does not concern the party being sued, the decision is only for a dispute over the sale of rubber between Eka Nasrun, President Director of PT Bintang Jaya Raya and the head of Bank BNI City Branch. It has nothing to do with this matter. This means that the Panel of Judges ‘shoots from the ground’, as if we were tricked and fooled, “said Djamhur.

Djamhur wondered why some of the jurisprudence related to the trademark dispute that he submitted was ignored, but the Panel of Judges instead used jurisprudence that had nothing to do with the case being decided.

“The Appeal Commission should have been involved as a defendant because what is being questioned is the certificate issued by the Appeals Commission. In fact, every decision of the Appeals Commission is usually challenged in the Commercial Court,” explained Djamhur.

Djamhur also highlighted the decision of the Panel of Judges which did not take into account the opinion of expert witnesses who stated that there were no similarities in essence between WD40 and Get All 40.

According to Djamhur, his party has also filed an exception regarding the Legal Standing of the plaintiff’s attorney because the principal’s passport is only in the form of a photocopy legalized by the local Indonesian Embassy, not the original document.

“The legalization of the local Indonesian Embassy is only limited to stamps and signatures, but not about the contents. The judge’s decision stated that the signature on the document was confirmed by the Consulate General of the Republic of Indonesia. Well, the words ‘justified’ cannot be proven. So the word justify is just an assumption by the Panel of Judges, not based on documentary evidence,” said Djamhur, who hoped that the Supreme Court would consider his appeal wisely and fairly.

Great earnings last quarter

Turnaround plan is actually working very well. Double digit revenue growth with gross margins above 60%.

Focus on product innovation by various segments that should increase revenues in the coming quarters.

Focus on Omnichannel sales in all markets rather than focusing only on Distribution channels.

More than 25% revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico.

Plan to shut down stores in China due to lack of product innovation in that market and launch new stores in new areas and malls with more foot traffic and a new product line.

Expansion into UK.

Inflation not a concern as price increases in products will offset inflationary concerns in COGS.

Debt/EBITDA 2.05 v/s in q2 21 compared to q2 20.

adjusted eps of $0.95 in Q2. I do see them reporting close to $3.1-3.4 eps for FY 21. 

$250m share buybacks announced a  couple of month ago, but none purchased in Q2 due to a lockup period. I think management will start buying in Q3.

Management does see a few headwinds in the 2H of 2021 as compared to the 1H.

This is a stock that is out of restructuring, great management and great business plan that can generate $3-4 EPS going forward and should be trading at $40-50

New management has done a great job in turning around the company and were still midway through that process.

This is a steal at 6.5 forward p/e.

The short interest a month and a half ago was at 12% and within the space of a month has increased to 26%. 

Current days to cover is over 9 while most highly shorted stocks are between 3-4 meaning on average shorts need more than 9 days to cover their shares on a margin call.

With a market cap of just over $1B and share buybacks of $250mm this is a company with a potential market cap of $750-900MM generating $3-4EPS",wallstreetbets,$TUP at steal at $23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pkauat/tup_at_steal_at_23/

Everyone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:

1) A goal to act upon

2) A support from media

3) Big players outside of the general playingfield

GME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.

**So what's with Uranium?**

Uranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**, as well as the Uranium **ETF URA and URNM**. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.

I'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.

So in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.

Now fast forward to the current date.

This is already 3) named Sprott. 

If you don't know Sprott: ""Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.""

What did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:

&gt;Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).

The expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.

**So what's with media support?**

[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)

Well, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not started at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:

[SPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium](https://preview.redd.it/ijwwo9ejiam71.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33e76055355ccabc24481db96479c78d6e64d45)

The media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.

**But what's the future of Uranium?**

I can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.

So combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.

**So what do I do if I want to join?**

As mentioned you can either buy CCJ or the 2 ETFs URA or URNM. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while the ETFs cover all the Uranium companies, making it a safer play though also covering the potential losers or low risers.",wallstreetbets,Uranium has explosive potential - and this time in both cases literally,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pkbvgw/uranium_has_explosive_potential_and_this_time_in/

Today I want to share my thoughts about $CLOV which has been discussed frequently over the weekend. There have been many YOLO posts about the stock which suggest a price spike within the next days. That's why I took a look at the chart of the stonk.

**Technical analysis**

As you can see the price is not trending lately. It is moving inside a price range after the huge price spike in June. Every attempt to raise again since then has been denied by shortsellers or frustrated bagholders that used the chance to get rid of their bags... who knows :P. 

Since the volume is very low I assume that we are still in an accumulation phase. Nevertheless during the last weeks a minor uptrend has been established.

If you have a closer look at the chart, you might see a gap around 11$. Usually those gaps get filled. It's like an unwritten law which applies almost every time. I would not be too surprised if the news coverage lately will lead to a new uptrend which will finally result in a **gap fill**. Therefore I will use the chance for a coin toss with a risk/reward of more than 1.6 to enter a trade here. 

Additionally there are some rumors of a short squeeze that might happen. I will just consider that as a bonus or lottery ticket. Still I would not count on it...

&amp;#x200B;

**About the Company:**

This play is NOT based around the fundamental value of SENS, but it is important to know what the company is before investing

SENS designs and manufactures Glucose monitoring systems. Their flagship device goes under the skin and transmits data to their app in real time! Their accuracy in real-time monitoring is revolutionary, especially considering that their newest transmitter lasts up to 180 days

They are currently awaiting FDA approval on the 180 day sensor, but have cleared most major regulatory hurdles

Knowing that they are creating a good product clears some of the risk

OK now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me show you the REAL fun!

&amp;#x200B;

**Options Market:**

SENS has an INSANELY bullish options market with a put/call ratio of 0.2! This means that for every put, there are 5 MORE call options purchased!

https://preview.redd.it/jz6b2kc613m71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d09088696f54471c70d55e9e19a0721bc2ed68fd

EVEN including meme stocks, this is the HIGHEST P/C ratio I have EVER SEEN

A high open interest and P/C ratio mean two things; the market thinks this stock will go up, and this has a potential for a gamma squeeze

The open interest on just the 9/17 expiry is INSANE

https://preview.redd.it/vvl7ln1813m71.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=129d16567d54d001cb1c61f84f4cc41e072ce50b

This means that ANY increase in IV or price of the underlying stock will lead to MM’s purchasing a shit ton of shares to ‘gamma hedge’ to stay delta-neutral, which in turn will lead to a chain reaction of MM’s buying shares to hedge which causes the price and IV to increase further

Every stock/option you buy will be multiplied by this effect, giving you a MUCH larger influence over the price of the stock

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Interest:**

Despite making a good product and having an insanely bullish options market, shorts have overshorted this stock up to 30% SI!

https://preview.redd.it/9ztjrfl913m71.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dceb3b966a7c7a5b5e34964dbb8ee986ea18fc7

Additionally, over the past few weeks about 45% of the daily volume has been sold short

https://preview.redd.it/lhfrrjna13m71.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b726e242fd39eaf23d1a346daa6831515c9a065e

These numbers alone don’t necessarily mean shorts will cover their positions… But if you include the bullish options market, which is primed for a gamma squeeze, and a potential FDA approval, you begin to see why shorts are fucked and will begin to close their positions soon. All this stock needs is a catalyst...

&amp;#x200B;

**Possible Catalysts:**

The main catalyst I see for a short squeeze is full FDA approval on their 180 day sensor. Once it is approved, many shorts who were betting on the company going bankrupt will get out

A few shorts covering mixed with such high open interest and new investors getting in will lead to a massive price spike and the potential to trigger margin calls on over-leveraged short positions

The more likely situation I see though is an immediate spike followed by slow exits from short positions. I don’t see a MOASS happening, but instead steady upwards momentum as shorts close their positions

I see the 180 day sensor being approved within the next 1-2 months as their 90 day sensor has already been cleared awhile ago and their 180 day sensor has cleared most regulatory requirements already

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

10 $3.5 C 9/17, 10 $4 C 9/17, 20 $4.5 C 9/17, 200 $5 C 9/17, 10 $3.5 C 10/15, 15 $4 C 10/15, 20 $4.5 C 10/15 100 shares

These numbers alone don’t necessarily mean shorts will cover their positions… But if you include the bullish options market, which is primed for a gamma squeeze, and a potential FDA approval, you begin to see why shorts are fucked and will begin to close their positions soon. All this stock needs is a catalyst...  


**Possible Catalysts:**

The main catalyst I see for upwards momentum is full FDA approval on their 180 day sensor. Once it is approved, many shorts who were betting on the company going bankrupt will get out

A few shorts covering mixed with such high open interest and new investors getting in will lead to a massive price spike and the potential to trigger margin calls on over-leveraged short positions

The more likely situation I see though is an immediate spike followed by slow exits from short positions. I don’t see a MOASS happening, but instead steady upwards momentum as shorts close their positions

I see the 180 day sensor being approved within the next 1-2 months as their 90 day sensor has already been cleared awhile ago and their 180 day sensor has cleared most regulatory requirements already

I know I said I was done updating on $IRNT, but I checked OI, and I couldn't help writing another update. Because we've got a 3 day weekend, I think we got the updated OI numbers a bit earlier than normal. I'll just paste them below to get started, then throw out some observations. Again, data from here: [https://www.cboe.com/delayed\_quotes/irnt/quote\_table](https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/irnt/quote_table). This is September expiries only. The only other expiration date with decent OI is October, and it's a fraction of September and doesn't change the analysis meaningfully.

https://preview.redd.it/6q5ik9mg63m71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c33e51a5b4e559c1710eb493c4904f1b4b7a0d7f

I think it's obvious looking at that table why the price went parabolic after hours. This was as of close on Friday, and 79% of the float was spoken for by delta-hedging options.

* Total call open interest went from 37k to 44k. The biggest changes were the newly listed strikes at $14 and $16 with an increase of 2k each.
* While those strikes tied up another 500k in shares, the other big change was the increase in delta at the $17.5 and $20 strikes which which doubled the shares represented from 400k to 800k.
* Put OI increased by approximately 2k, but the dramatic price increase sent delta towards 0 and effectively reduced the shares represented by 25%.
* The market opened up $31 through $37 strikes for trading tomorrow.

What does that all mean for tomorrow? Honest answer: I'm not sure and you shouldn't base any decisions on my speculation below. I'm playing with house money and trying to turn a 10x into a 100x here. However, what I think it means:

* This is actually, dare I say it, a $GME situation but on a far smaller scale... There just aren't enough shares, and it's going to be a technically driven frenzy. It could all happen tomorrow, or it could be a multi-day leg up like we saw in prior gamma squeezes.
* The delta adjusted OI has already wrapped up almost the entire float, and if the afterhours settled price of \~$30 holds, delta for the $20s will jump to \~.8 and the increase in demand for shares for \*only\* that strike will be another 700k shares that are not currently available.
* I don't know where this could stop, but I'm hoping I can exit my calls at a share price of &gt;$80.

So what are the risks? What could derail this money machine? I see a few key risks in order of likelihood:

* IV for calls blows up over 300-400, creating lots of sellers looking for a quick flip. This would have been me last week, but with the latest update, I'm holding out for more than 2x from Friday.
* The MM hedge by buying an enormous volume of September puts at the top of the option chain. As put IV blows up, selling them will become more attractive to our friends over at thetagang, and MM will be buying delta from them to offset the runaway train on the call side.
* MMs could hedge by buying calls in the out months to offset the short dated calls. That would leave them exposed to theta and lots of the lesser Greeks guys like us don't worry about, but that might be the lesser of two evils in this case. I believe that reduces their need for total shares since the long and short calls would offset each other, for the most part.
* Some sort of action by an exchange or individual brokers to reduce volatility. This could be as simple as lots of market stops that interrupt momentum, or something more insidious like blowing up collateral requirements (although they're already 100% on Schwab) or limiting buys. I think this is unlikely because there aren't enough shares for this to make up a meaningful % of client assets like $GME and $AMC were.
* Company action to increase float immediately. I think this is the least likely because any change would likely require a vote, a multiple day notification to shareholders, and/or a board of directors meeting. Only the board meeting can happen quickly. I'm not sure if there could be an announcement to direct list some of the lockup shares at board discretion. Any securities lawyers here who would know? That would be by far the most likely to stop this in its tracks, but I don't think they can do that. If I'm wrong, please let me know!

Last thing I want to say. There WILL be an announcement of the listing of the PIPE soon. It could come as soon as tomorrow or as late as 30 days after ticker change. That will almost certainly not have immediate effect, so there is no reason to dump your shares the minute that filing comes out. There will likely be a temporary pullback when they announce listing of the PIPE shares, but I think it will be an overreaction because the share count will not be immediately changed. This should stay crazy through the 17th, and if call buying rolls through October could continue after that as well.

My position here remains small: 20 $20 September calls. I may add some shares depending how the premarket goes tomorrow.

As always, I'm open to any corrections or feedback that improves the overall understanding of the situation, and let me know if I've missed anything.

Good luck and take care of yourselves. This is super high risk, so don't risk more than you can lose. It sure as hell ain't financial advice.",wallstreetbets,$IRNT Gamma Squeeze In Progress,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pjnhat/irnt_gamma_squeeze_in_progress/

What's up retards, this week I may have found the best play I have EVER found to make you fucking RICH!

Don’t you HATE how your wife’s boyfriend calls YOU a cuck?

Well... after SENS, you can fire him and become your OWN wife’s boyfriend! Doesn’t it sound nice to have her ALL to yourself?

Now that I got your smooth-brained attention, let me explain why SENS is going to the FUCKING MOON  


**About the Company:**

This play is NOT based around the fundamental value of SENS, but it is important to know what the company is before investing

SENS designs and manufactures Glucose monitoring systems. Their flagship device goes under the skin and transmits data to their app in real time! Their accuracy in real-time monitoring is revolutionary, especially considering that their newest transmitter lasts up to 180 days

They are currently awaiting FDA approval on the 180 day sensor, but have cleared most major regulatory hurdles

Knowing that they are creating a good product clears some of the risk

OK now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me show you the REAL fun!  


**Options Market:**

SENS has an INSANELY bullish options market with a put/call ratio of 0.2! This means that for every put, there are 5 MORE call options purchased!

https://preview.redd.it/19efbb3s63m71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06eaf8999fc41ebb744b94810c3e48a559e48bb1

EVEN including meme stocks, this is the HIGHEST P/C ratio I have EVER SEEN

A high open interest and P/C ratio mean two things; the market thinks this stock will go up, and this has a potential for a gamma squeeze

The open interest on just the 9/17 expiry is INSANE

https://preview.redd.it/73l9irys63m71.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f802e076ba024b3e3bdd860583d67c66ed8a1b5f

This means that ANY increase in IV or price of the underlying stock will lead to MM’s purchasing a shit ton of shares to ‘gamma hedge’ to stay delta-neutral, which in turn will lead to a chain reaction of MM’s buying shares to hedge which causes the price and IV to increase further

Every stock/option you buy will be multiplied by this effect, giving you a MUCH larger influence over the price of the stock

**Short Interest:**

Despite making a good product and having an insanely bullish options market, shorts have overshorted this stock up to 30% SI!

https://preview.redd.it/cheh15yt63m71.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6f19c70ce3d56e419f9c3c0f3a00d2152bb8cb

Additionally, over the past few weeks about 45% of the daily volume has been sold short

All this stock needs is a catalyst...

SPUT trades at $2k a share with no options.  Instead, I’m long 65 x 4/22 $25s of URA.  

Last summer, I recognized an odd phenomenon. An obscure entity named Grayscale Bitcorn Trust (GBTC – USA) was slowly cornering the free float in Bitcorn. This was a result of the trust structure where any capital that went in, was converted into Bitcorn, but there was no mechanism in place to ever sell coins and redeem that capital. As a result, GBTC became a growing repository of Bitcorn. At first, it bought a few hundred coins a day, then a thousand, then a few thousand. As the trading volume increased, the inflows also increased. As the inflows increased, the daily bitcorn purchases increased, eventually driving the Bitcorn price higher. As the price went higher, new investors were drawn to GBTC and the inflows accelerated—spinning the flywheel faster. It was so obvious that this would lead to higher prices, that I called it “My Favorite Ponzi Scheme…” Over time, much as I had predicted, these inflows drove the price of Bitcorn and ultimately GBTC dramatically higher. Early this year, I had a well-timed exit for a quick multi-bagger and my capital went onto greener pastures in depressed energy assets.

I bring this all up, as I see a similar phenomenon in uranium—a much smaller and less liquid market, potentially creating a more dramatic effect should inflows accelerate. Long-time readers of this site will remember that I have a sweet spot for Uranium. I wrote about it back in 2019 but sold out during the first quarter of 2020 as the global equity markets collapsed and better opportunities presented themselves. At the time, the thesis, while directionally accurate, didn’t pan out as the supply deficit was insufficient to overcome above-ground stockpiles, capping price discovery.



In the year and change since I sold out, the overall supply deficit has continued to increase, while above-ground stockpiles have continued to be consumed. While uranium aficionados like to fixate on calculating the current deficit to the nearest decimal, for the sake of this post, let’s use some VERY broad numbers. The world is producing roughly 125 million pounds from primary mining, 25 million pounds from secondary sources and consuming roughly 180 million pounds, for an overall deficit of 30 million pounds a year. This deficit will only increase in future years, as additional reactors come online. If you want to quibble with my numbers, quibble away. I know I’m off by a few million pounds, but so is everyone else. No one really knows the true numbers—which is what makes commodity markets so fascinating in the first place. All that matters is that there is a deficit, it’s a big percentage of total production, new mines are not coming online at current prices and existing mines have had years of under-investment—hence production should continue to trail off without new investment.

How large are the above-ground stockpiles? No one knows. All we know is that they’re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they’ve completely upended the equilibrium.


My Favorite Ponzi Scheme…
Remember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there’s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold—making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it’s GBTC 2.0—issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.

Remember, no one ever needs a bitcorn . Everyone who is long Bitcorn is a potential seller and on the way up, they’ll all eventually sell. Uranium is different—almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors—these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they’re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they’re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don’t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they’re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.



Sprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (U-U – Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.

As expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I’m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who’d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they’ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn’t be surprising. Inevitably, they’ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium–it’s not their money anyway.

I'm not talking about GME, BB, CLOV etc, just something new that nobody knows yet and very few people have been discussing here.

Despite this should be enough and understand for starting a discussion, I want to remind you that taking suggestions from your wife's bf is also allowed.

I need to write a bit more because apparently my submission is not long enough to make sense for a post. Honestly I think it does, but I know where the mod are coming from, is understandable. So said, let me write something totally useless that the bot would consider to be something very interesting and long enough not to cancel this post.

At this point I think it should be enough? Who knows.. I can keep going like when your wife is trying to say some shit about her day and about what she have been doing. We all know that we don't care about that shit, also because she grabs our attention for like 1 hour while she could've said the same damn thing in just like  1 minute? Most of the words are useless because they don't add any value at the discussion, but still required because the wife decide that she has a lot to say.

Every now and then she'll be ""are you listening"" and you need to look at her instead of the GME graph going to the moon, because if you don't... Then you sleep in the couch.

That's the reason why she has a bf, I guess our wife bf listen her... Or he pretend to. But because he does it so well, she give him better rewards that you never got before (that backdoor that you've been asking for years, he got it in just few days by listening to her shit).

In any case I feel compelled to add my 2 cents in today for what’s it worth.
I just turned 65 a couple months ago and have spent my adult years working in the “blue collar” world, like I’m sure a lot of fellow group members.
Through the years I invested in the market always to be succumbed by FUD, FOMO…and suffered through a few costly recessions.
In the mid early 2000’s Yahoo provided stock groups that gave any hope of retailer group solidarity remotely to WSB, but it wasn’t long before the credibility dwindled and it became pilfered with shills etc. 

However never was the solidarity, organization and DD so intense as the “Reddit” crowd and you all made it work! For the first time in history greedy hedge fund managers got their asses handed to them.

My reason for involvement is obviously monetary gain but also a strong desire to take part in a historical movement that finally may help change some level of corruption (I won’t claim to be too idealistic here!)on Wallstreet and for once develop a fairer play ground between the poor and rich.  Putting the power in retailers hands!

I wrote my economics thesis on their bad debt maturities for the coming 10 years, specifically in 'shadow banking'.

My conclusions were that:

If there were significant defaults in their 'shadow banking' industry the CCP could cover as much as 13 T USD in initial damages to the industry which would raise their risk profile and increase future cost of debt. The worst part about this debt is that is largely it is all OBS, (similar to MBS from the GFC). These 'bombs' are WMP (Wealth Management Products) and are actually highly leveraged instruments that through a web of borrowings with state banks use CCP money to invest in risky business loans.

A lot of which have failed, you can read about the slew of 'shadow banks' failing in recent years with more and more in the past year.

There is a lot of speculation the CCP is already sterilising a large amount of bad-debts through perpetual loans for these 'shadow banks' to prevent a collapse of the industry and eternal damnation for Xi's finance minister.

This kind of catastrophe would derail China's economic vision and would cause a long and painful recession around the world.

To respond to your point about a sterilisation, it's my opinion that they wouldn't be able to cover the onslaught as it would be almost impossible to keep track of defaulting debt. This is because it is completely out of sight and thus the ability for Chinese governing bodies and financial regulators to take financial assistance action is an extremely difficult task in itself.

I’m a January Ape who has held and averaged down in both Movie and Gaming stocks this year.

I invested in these two companies first and foremost to get a massive return on an investment from short-squeezes.  Second, I am here to back companies which I feel bring value to my life, and the lives of others.  And lastly, I am here to use the return on my investments to provide a better future for my family while working to be a catalyst of change on specific grassroots issues I believe in.

Along the way we all have been exposed to the deep-levels of corruption and systemic issues plaguing the Financial Markets.

I believe to some degree each person (aka Ape) involved in these stocks has a similar framework of reasons and experience as well.  We get-in to make money, start to dream about a better future, then see/read tons of DD only to get enraged because the corruption threatens what we see as our one-chance at a new possibility.

HOWEVER, to pursue bringing chaos and intimidation into the world will not yield ANY financial return on investment. ZERO, It Won’t Work.

The single-most powerful piece of “DD” is that Shorts Have Not Covered.  That is it.  That is all you have to know.  That is the foundation of everything.

The ongoing, and continual exposing of “irrefutable information” or new corruption may indeed yield criminal charges but, does it support the initial reason you invested?  Does someone going to prison give you what you want?  Of course, people need to be held accountable but, does that mean MOASS will happen when/if they are indicted?

Right Now, taking these people out of the market may only delay or prohibit the squeeze from occurring.

You can be right, and still not get what you want.

Living and traveling abroad for over 50 years, I am fully aware of, and have experienced firsthand the beauty and injustices in the world.  I have also experienced how people create strong desires for fundamental changes in their lives, only to fall-short because they have an addiction to being right.

If you are honest with yourself, and came into the market for any of the reasons I mentioned earlier - it was not because you wanted to be right about a certain aspect of these stonks….  It was because you wanted a different possibility for yourself.

I would ask that we think about the addiction to being right versus getting what you want. 

Reddit like other Social (engineered) Applications acknowledge your existence (“let me give you a pat on the head”) by awarding you/us with Karma, etc…  As we strive to be “Right” or “First” there is a natural deviation from our own personal reasons for investing.  We lose sight of what the first priority is, which is taking care of ourself and our family.

Being a victim to your emotions after seeing the corruption will cause you to forget why you initially invested.  I believe the Market Makers, SHF, and even MSM is counting on us to implode from within as we lose-sight of why we invested and forgetting the simplest and most profound truths…

Shorts have not covered.

In chemistry, one tries to control a billion billion billion million things. you can think of them like lego pieces that want to fit together but they have to bonk the right way. they are trying to react, trying to make things happen. 

the secret to chemistry is accepting chaos, accepting the probabilistic nature of reality, going with it, until all of the objective material signs are pointing the same direction.

$600 million+ in cash on hand
No debt

Losing money? For now yes. But their expenses have been uncharacteristically high due to COVID related backlog. As this normalizes their margins start to improve significantly as their revenues continue to grow exponentially

140% YOY revenue growth as of Q2 following up 100% YOY revenue growth in Q1

Did over $400 million revenue in Q2 alone, on track for $1.5 billion+ this year 

Direct Contracting revenue has been a major driver of their explosive growth, and they are part of an exclusive club that is allowed to participate in this program.

TAM is in the hundreds of billions, soon to be trillions as Democrats are pushing Medicare expansion to those between 60-65. 

Half of all Medicare recipients elect to go with a MA provider like Clover. So the market opportunity is massive! Their competitors are giants with market caps in the hundreds of billions, even if we take just a tiny slice of the market this will be multi bagger.

The supposed DOJ inquiry was over a year and a half ago, with nothing coming out of it. Needless to say this was massively overblown by shorts to drive the price down!

Innovation! Clover Assistant is attempting to upend the multi trillion dollar healthcare market by using AI to optimize outcomes for providers and patients alike. Clover was just granted two patents covering this last week!

Partnerships have continued to pile up as Clover continues to build their vision of healthcare done differently as they battle a sector that hasn’t seen major technological innovation in decades and is one of the last segments that hasn’t seen significant AI penetration

I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn’t believe. I turned around and said “Sir… I’m sorry, what did you just say?” He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food…he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. 

So…when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at…I’m sure it’s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I’m not joking…**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn’t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew…we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1

After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) 

I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.

The dollar index after J. POW’s Jackson Hole Speech. 😂 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy

Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.

                  Technical Analysis

Let me start with my TA  first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX 

**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**

Here is one from Thursday, September 2.

https://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5

**$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. 

Let me explain why…

              Updated GDP Forecasts

**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**

For fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! 

**“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”**

**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…** 

             Wall Street‘a High Expectations

So far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.

The strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. 😳 So…. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings….which I guarantee that will happen… it’s going to be an earnings miss galore. 

                     Lumber/Gold Ratio

Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.

When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.

**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**

This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.

Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ 

I like this one better compared to the DOW 30. 
https://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB

The lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)

Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.

                Consumer Confidence

**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**

So…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.

**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.**


                      Conclusion

**Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…**

**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**

No big deal right? 

**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP

No big deal right?

**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi

No big deal right? 

**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**

Now…**my positions.** Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…Not financial advice. 

**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. 
$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold
$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold

Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp 

**Long term:**

One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)
It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 

2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. 

1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)

One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC 
Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) 

**My last position:**

**$2,500 in Cash.**

Simply put…**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. 

Good luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!

**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.**

I’m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I’m saying that maybe it’s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don’t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m… another bearish catalyst for the market… I literally could go on and on guys…. It’s pretty obvious at this point…we’ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December.

Instead I started researching new companies with high growth potential in the long-term. I realised the best ones to beat the potential market correction or even crash as a result of the market all time highs reached every single month lately, are the latest IPOs from 2019/2021. 

To cut this short and make it easier for you, I’ve selected these 5 companies that had recent IPOs and have huge growth potential according to all newspapers, analysts and most importantly historical trends.

These are:
1. Fiverr (IPO June 2019)
2. Coursera (IPO March 2021)
3. Squarespace (IPO May 2021)
4. UiPath (IPO April 2021)
5. Robinhood (IPO July 2021)

Also just needed to say this , investing and trading are different ... aver

Investing= I Dont give a fuck if pltr drops to 20 bucks or if it is range for a week or 2 , im buying in this company and expecting it to be worth 5x 5-10 years from now . These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.

Another example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.

Investing is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** 

trading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.

Here let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. 

Shit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .

Shit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?

And then we know QE has linear correlation to stock market and then repo operation has what relation to the market?

But what I don't understand is how repo/reverse repo operation directly impact stock market? This repo operations also pump the money into the market like QE..?  What I read about repo operations is to keep the federal funds rate in the target range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)..Now my question is, this repo operations process is also adds money into the system like QE or sucking money out of the system? that's all I just wanted to differentiate the goal of repo operations and wanted to understand how this related to stock market.

**Oroco Resources has a very large copper porphyry deposit called Santo Tomas, which already has historical drill holes (done in 1994) that give us an indication of how much copper there is in the ground.**

Due to a legal battle that lasted many years, Santo Tomas was never completely explored and developed. The legal battle was resolved in January of 2020.

Oroco has to drill more holes, define exactly how much copper they have, the grade, and then they will sell it to a major.

Unlike other exploration companies who are hoping to find copper in the ground, Oroco already has the answers. They don’t need to take significant risks and develop a mine. They just need to drill, run the numbers, and sell the deposit to a major.

**In addition, Oroco’s management team is very trustworthy.**

Oroco’s management team had options exercisable at $0.07/share, but to prevent diluting shareholders, they cancelled a large number of them and reset them at $0.75/share.

**Now, taking a macro overview of copper, we’ll take a look at the supply side…**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/il1x0x1j2pl71.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dfaf0a0dd4843c8c9d405fc9271d99eb3e3844

 **And then the demand side…** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4qduovpk2pl71.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a4e34a5b3be4c88c80a136cde5b9d64f0eff84

There are very few (I’m not sure if it’s 0) undeveloped copper porphyry deposit as large as Santo Tomas, and it’s a certainty that it will get acquired by a major once all the drilling is done.

There are still many catalysts in the short to medium term. Oroco will get the drilling permit around mid-May of 2021, and once drilling starts, every hole and result will cause the share price to rocket higher and higher.

**For some kind of proxy on how Oroco’s share price will react to each catalyst, just look at Solaris Resources (15 holes drilled, and it’s at $1.5B market cap)…**

&amp;#x200B;

**While we won’t know until they drill and figure out the exact amount and grade of the copper, I would say $10/share for Oroco would be the lower bound.**

And so, there is still decent upside to be had. If great things happen and we find more copper and even higher-than-expected grade, then $20+ per share is possible.

Of course, we will have to find out and see. But truth be told, there is only upside from here.",wallstreetbets,Copper DD - Oroco Resources,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pie17f/copper_dd_oroco_resources/

$IRNT IronNet, Inc. - an actual gamma squeeze candidate?
MODS, please unban the ticker name for this company as it now meets the requirements to be posted here. I am using the full name of the company on this post because I can't post the ticker.

This information couldn't be shared on Wall Street Bets before because the market cap was below the $1.5 Billion limit. As of after-hours closing on Sept 3rd, the market cap is now about $2.45 billion (84.42 million shares outstanding multiplied by $29.23 closing price).

To start with, I am super skeptical of anything that mentions the word ""squeeze."" Post-GME, it became a way to lure in suckers to be holding the dump after your pump. However, either this is going to be an honest to God gamma squeeze, or I've missed something big time.

Here's the background...a pretty good SPAC sponsor actually, acquired IronNet Cyber Security. However, 90% of the shares were redeemed last week. This brought the total float down to 1.2M shares. In addition, 1.5M shares from management were unlocked, giving us a total 2.7M shares available to trade.

Usually, options trading requires a much higher float than this. The CBOE requires a 7M share float (technically, 7M shares owned by holders without reporting requirements), and 2.4M shares traded in the last 12 months before allowing options trading. $ IronNet Cyber Security is far below that, but before redemptions, the SPAC sponsor wasn't. This has created a bit of a hole in the CBOE liquidity rulebook.

What does that mean for us? Well, there are a huge number of options being traded and a huge OI growing by the day. There are something like 40k total call options outstanding and more than 30k in September expiries alone, and there's also been almost no retail interest either on Reddit or Twitter. I see a few reasons for that - market cap rules, the ticker change creates a delay in data for stock screeners to start finding it, and there have been plenty of other exciting meme trades over the last week. To me that means we're looking at smart money accumulating options with the intention of driving a gamma squeeze. Once retail catches on, they'll maintain the momentum and be left holding the bag.

Let's do a deeper dive on what these calls represent relative to the float. I've looked at September calls only and pulled the latest OI from CBOE. That data is below.
https://preview.redd.it/rlgimvavlyk71.png?width=1805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21b9268dadc2c3eeefe112aa5f198d2c62f30d9

Remember that puts have the exact opposite hedging behavior as calls, so I've netted them out and included their impact on gamma as well. Currently, 31% of the float is tied up hedging these long calls. On top of that, a $1 increase in the underlying price will drive net buying of ~11% of the float in order to maintain delta-neutrality. In addition, gamma will increase and the net hedging will accelerate as the $17.5 and $20 strikes get closer to in the money. This gives us a price around $17 where there aren't enough shares to hedge the outstanding pool of call options and we get a gamma squeeze.

Conversely, this option pricing effect can be just as dramatic on the downside as the upside. If the price falls below $10, expect most of the 400k shares represented by the $12.5 strikes to add to selling pressure.

There is one major assumption we're making here - that all these trades are unilateral with the market maker and the market maker is taking the short side of that trade. That's almost certainly not true, but I believe it's fair to assume the majority are.

In summary, I *think* we are watching one or more hedge funds set up for a dramatic spike in share price caused by market dynamics. Similarly, I think now is the time to invest alongside them to get a quick 4-5x return.
I'll end with a request. If you have information that disproves this thesis please share it. I have been looking for contradictory evidence, but have found very little.

Edit:
From their latest 8-K filed today. Post merger, there were 84,423,567 shares outstanding. 66,160,197 are subject to a lockup. 12,500,000 were PIPE shares that are not yet registered and not yet tradable, and 3.2M shares that are locked up except for charitable donations.

The next shares that are expected to be tradable are the 1,078,125 incentive shares that are awarded to legacy shareholders if the stock price exceeds $13 for 10 consecutive days. The earliest that could be is September 9th. If this goes off, it will be before the 9th.

Do you have 20 years to spare? 

If so, I think buying TSLA now will make your future self very happy. 

Last month I posted a 10-year prediction for TSLA of over $43K. After rigorous analysis (watching YouTube videos) I feel incredibly confident of this bet, and even think it may be conservative 🤔. 

But while the next 10 years are setting up to be epic, the following 10 years might be even better. 

Not only will the Bot and robotaxi be in full swing, but they will likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), and with that come untold riches. I’m talkin’ the singularity 🔥

Listen up autists and retards, Uranium is heating up to make all of you, as many trendies as you desire. 

Many have been following the industry, for years or months, and are witnessing the coming explosion of ALL companies Uranium. And they are fucking excited.  BULLs did not think SPROTT would move the market with such ease. Which it is doing, with Canadian rupees. 

Do you remember last year, posts about lumber, mattresses, or shipping, but ended up buying black berry and weed stocks?? Well this is your chance to make up for that horrible decision your wife left you over. 

Some of these stocks will 3-5x, and nano caps could 10x. 

The market cap of the industry is around 30BN---ITS 20 PERCENT OF NORTH AMERICAN BASELOAD POWER. This is chicken shit, even to the europoors. This market can be moved very easily, and its fully underway. 

The industry has been killed by the utility companies who has been buying cheap Uranium, well guess what….that is over now. Their contacts are up, and SPROTT is buying up all that cheap Yellow Cake for their fat boomer investors.  Game theory, simple, drive up the spot price is a thin market. 

Unlike other metals, it is virtually impossible manipulate, thorough paper, imitation, or recycling—once it leaves storage it is SPENT. Gone, good buy---they need more, or the power goes out, not an option.

It's been a wild ride.  It started with a whistle blower lawfirm throwing allegations....and only 48 hours after the allegations did they declare they were indeed short the stock.  How is this not illegal?

Then, Adam Feurstein and STAT News have piled on, calling $sava a fraud and picking apart every single thing in their history.  It is my inclination that AF is backed by a bio company (probably Biogen) or a hedge fund to spew short news.  It is the only thing that makes sense.

$SAVA has been attacked by academics, law firms and hedge funds over the past week, making fun of the 'meme' stock and how it is run by retail traders who are too dumb to know a fraud when they see it.

It's astonished, and saddened me, to see so many people want a new Alzheimers drug to fail.  My grandparents both had Alzheimers, and my mother has it too- I will probably get it.  I hope that we can find a cure to end ALZ- and if $sava can do it, all the better.

3. Partnership

We have heard alot of rumors surounding Apple potentialy intergrating some of GSAT:s functionality in to the upcoming [iphone 13](https://fortune.com/2021/08/30/iphone-13-satellite-globalstar-stock-gsat/), that some sources claim is not going to happen. I tend to agree with the latter, but what I belive people are missing from the puzzle is the rumored new extreme version of the [Apple watch](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/apple-considers-launching-rugged-watch-for-extreme-sports), this is a product where GSAT intergration would make much more sense, and intergrating emergency beacon functionality to Extreme sporting watches has already been done by Breitling in their [Extreme watch](https://www.breitling.com/us-en/emergency/).

Alltough Apple watch might bring in as much revenue to GSAT as iphone 13 intregration would, im confindent that 37.5M every quarter in payment to GSAT is just the begining of the pontential cash flow from this product intergration.

Edit: If these mystery cashflows are going to be consistent 37.5M per qurater, that amounts to 150M every year. GSAT:s current revenue is 128M and the market value it at 4B$, if we assume that the market is pricing in around 17% Growth rate with a WACC of around 20% we get to the current valuation of 4B with today revenue. If we add in the extra 150M from this mystery customer and discount it with the same WACC and growth rate, we get to a valuation of 8.8B or a stock price of around 4.8. But if we say that this deal makes the market price in even more future growth, which i think it will, with a Growth of around 20% the valuation instead lands closer to 20B or 10$ per share.

In Q1 , 2021- Nikola received a conditional order for 100 battery-electric and fuel-cell trucks. To expedite zero-emission transport at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Total Transportation Services signed a letter of intent to order 100 Nikola Class 8 semi-trucks of both types.
A four-truck pilot program will start in the first half of 2022, consisting of two battery-electric trucks and two fuel-cell trucks. If that works out and if Total Transportation Services gets government funds, 30 battery-electric trucks would follow later in 2022, with 70 fuel-cell trucks due to start in 2023.
Meanwhile, Nikola is making some progress on starting to build up infrastructure. In April, Nikola announced plans to create a hydrogen pipeline network in Germany with its partners CNH Industrial (CNHI) and OGE.
Also last month, it announced a deal with TravelCenters of America (TA) to install hydrogen refueling stations for heavy-duty trucks at two sites in California. These sites may begin operation as early as the first quarter of 2023.

On June 24, 2021 Nikola invest 50m in Wabash Valley Resources

Nikola has a plant in Germany to produce the semi-truck TRE it’s operational and running!

Over all Nikola is setting up well and results for their tests on the trucks where really good! Nikola is looking to deliver a few of TRE trucks to trusted Companies that are really interested and most likely want more of the trucks after they test them of course! 

Note-
With all this said Nikola has yet to make false statements and or misguide investors since Trevor Melton left as CEO!

# Bullish Fundamentals

* Good brand recognition with the F150 as the most popular pickup Truck in America. 
* Ready to roll out the new EVs on 2022 with reservations going crazy. 
* Affordable price.
* Loyal customer base. 
* Strategic partnerships (Rivian, SK)
* Currently seems to be the only EV Pickup truck to come out on 2022. Cybertruck is scheduled to come out in 2022 as well but there is a chance it might get pushed back again. 

# Bear Case

* Mach E is the Prius of the Mustangs... Ugly as hell.

# Technicals 

Currently there is strong support at 13$ with resistance levels at: 14$, and 16.5$.

**ENTER:  ROBLOX.**  A super retarded video game company that just missed revenues Aug. 17th, and is claiming to goldman sachs they are going to be a part of the ""metaverse"" and not just a ""game."" LUL

Now some numbers: Roblox does have fat revenue, at **$454M.**  However, they are priced to absolute perfection in some cathie woods psychadelic trip nightmare at **$48.57B.**  

**Roblox Float: 221.93M shares**

**Shares to be released from Lockup Sep. 6th: approx. 200M according to market beat.**  

What does this mean?  if those executives wake up, look at their ""growth company"" \*cough childs videogame\* that just missed earnings and realize they are millionaires and it's time to take profit on lockup day?  ya.  Possible max selloff insiders just on new shares of **$18B.  In a company worth $48B.  That is some serious potential sell pressure.  Even a small fraction of that is huge.**  

**On average this year, tech companies have lost 10% of value on lockup period expiry's.**  

**So here is my play/position:  +30 Sep. 10 82P, and +5 Sep. 24 80P.**  

I plan to add alot more as we get closer if the stock price is going higher.  

This is not financial advice, I just don't like the stock and I can't imagine any insider is going to not sell a decent chunk.  Especially with market at ATH.

The whole crackdown on Chinese tech started with Jack Ma when he talked publicly and in front of Chinese high officials , how Chinese financial system is old and cant catch up with tech innovation. This was about ANT IPO. Well, imagine the best screw up and Jack Ma did that. But this can turn into an opportunity for those who didnt have positions before in Chinese stocks. 

2 weeks after Jack Ma ‘s speech, crackdown started in November last year. It is my opinion that even CCP did not imagine this much sell off. Now I believe they are taking their feet from the brake , they cant let Chinese entrepreneurship lose its hope and they need large companies to rival American ones. 

Also don’t forget that these scrutiny is good for Chinese stocks in the long term. It makes them better organization by fixing their weaknesses.

# Lust for Life, LLC (the ""Company""), the main subsidiary of Renewable Energy &amp; Power, Inc. (OTC PINK: RBNW), is excited to announce that the Lust for Life Footwear brand (""LFL"") has been focusing on developing boots and booties for the Fall 2021 season. Last year there were fewer boots produced due to pandemic stay-at-home restrictions. Inventory for this season became very low which gave the retailers a bigger appetite for the upcoming Fall 2021 season. LFL has begun developing products with large private label customers and will be shipping $700,000 dollars of exciting new styles in the fashion boot category during August and early September.

# During the last few months, the Lust for Life team has been very pleased to have begun shipping its popular fashion footwear again to our main retailers, including Burlington, TJ Maxx and major retail discounters. This is part of our strategy with a continued work in progress into the private brand sector, via channels such as Bloomingdale's outlet.

# As we proceed forward, Lust for Life is also in the process of building out its Spring collection to expand to retailers who are looking for a boutique house like us to source high profile, in-demand footwear products. The present changes in the marketplace have actually given us an edge up in both our business negotiations and as a sourcing agent for other retailers and wholesalers.

# Lust for Life is looking forward to the continuing growth of the company's successful brand and private label sectors in the balance of 2021 and well beyond.

Insiders buying a ton of shares because they know the recent hit piece was just short sellers making a quick pay day. Go ahead and look at the sell off volume then the buy back the following days. That play is complete and now the stock is floating free, waiting for the news that reveals it is in fact, not dead. 

These guys will be back to the 20 average at that news, waiting for the next catalyst to determine where it goes from there. It's not a question of if it recovers, but when. 

Next catalyst? Well the drop happened after hit articles said they were dead after their last clinical. But they're not dead, the product still shows effectiveness and viability. So when FDA makes any positive comments about the data they will submit for the next trial, it will shoot right back to the $20 range it floated around when Theta Gang first brought it to my attention for its high iv.

But now? Low as fuck iv, cheap as fuck calls, and easy upward momentum with super low trading volume. And it comes with the benefit also of a healthy dose of skepticism by shorts who might not have yet closed their position. 

When it returns to $20, it will be a fat green candle, in one trading hour, iv spike and primed for a vega play sell. 

So, with 5 months time, it's an easy play with this pick, in my opinion:

That store you always go to to buy things for your wife so she might actually sleep with you for once in her life? Yeah... Well it turns out BBBY is far from dead and has successfully rebranded itself into an undervalued e-commerce giant poised for massive future growth!  

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals:**  

Despite being in the middle of a digital transformation from a retail store into an e-commerce giant while dealing with a global pandemic and supply-chain shocks, BBBY has managed to grow at a rapid pace while maintaining stable gross margins and a strong balance sheet

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nnxg5ly14pk71.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50b848b70a3d734333fdd7e45d3abfea7445184

 In Q1 2021, BBBY experienced 49.5% revenue growth while still increasing their gross margins to 32.4% through streamlining their operations. Additionally, their past 4 quarters of online sales have all had consecutive sales growth, breaking the seasonal trend and showing a great movement towards ecommerce  

Q2 should be even better for them as they have continued streamlining operations and expect to post over 2B in revenue  

BBBY has over 1.2 BILLION dollars of cash on-hand which they can use to continue moving towards e-commerce, create in-house products, and keep up growth. That cash alone is 40% of their ENTIRE market cap, not even including additional assets.   

Management has seen how undervalued their company is and has repurchased $130m of shares to take advantage of this, with more share purchases to come. This shows how strong of a position they are in and how confident management is that their stock will increase in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/roim01484pk71.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=678d71fd485768434f1a2f6a50d0b97a98c0f768

Even though they are focusing on growth instead of profitability right now, BBBY’s P/E ratio is STILL in line with the S@P 500 average 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok... now that you understand how undervalued this company is, let me introduce to you the management

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

Management is one of, if not the most important factors for how well a company will do, and BBBY has some of the best management a company could hope for

&amp;#x200B;

Mark Tritton, the current CEO, has had over 30 years of experience in retail and oversaw Target’s streamlining and digital transformation as Executive VP. He has a clear vision for the company and has the industry connections and know-how to get it done

&amp;#x200B;

Gustavo Arnal, the current CFO, has had experience turning around struggling companies before, most notably Avon. He has experience leading WBA’s global division and can help the company reach international markets

&amp;#x200B;

John Hartmann, the current COO, has had experience being the CEO of True Value Company which focused on hardwear. He also has experience working in Home Depot’s digital transformation program. He can help BBBY create some products of their own while guiding this digital push

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more amazing people on the leadership team, but these 3 are the ones who stand out to me due to their unique abilities in certain fields

&amp;#x200B;

Management is what creates and directs a company’s visions and operations. With these 3 people on their team, BBBY covers all needed areas; Digital transformation, global supply-chains, hardwear production, and financial streamlining

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorts:**

Despite being in such a good position, BBBY still has a 23% short interest left over from the whole meme stock surge in January(edited)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3vw8ucdd4pk71.png?width=1796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59847892b2ab7babafd50d3d2275c3b07caa6d7

This is not enough to cause a squeeze, but what it has been doing for the past few months is providing a price floor (at around 26$) and upward momentum as shorts take the loss and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meme stocks:**  My play is based around the fundamentals of the company, but meme stocks are so closely correlated that it makes sense to mention them  

Price action with BBBY has been closely correlated with other meme stocks since the January squeeze. If my theory is correct and meme stocks have a resurgence, we could see BBBY mooning again 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ub0opfck4pk71.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c47d9edcfa08ab601610c1c877b5dbc7171a61

 This play is more about how undervalued the company is, but if you believe that there will be a new meme stock cycle then buying short dated calls could work. The call options have such low open interest that they are trading way below what they should be   

**Positions:**

120 Shares, 25 30c 9/3, 25 29.5 9/10, 10 30c 9/17

**TLDR:** 

BBBY is undervalued and overshorted. This provides a great long term play as the company keeps doing better and shorts keep closing their positions

I saw how things were going, and I decided that I was going to do a little option trading.  I had $4880.42 in cash in my account, and I wanted to go slow at the start of the day.

I bought 10 contracts of QQQ for 1.20 plus commissions and fees, and turned around and sold it at 1.38 in a few minutes.  Day started off great making $180 roughly in 2 minutes.  If I hadn't paper handed it, I could have made a couple K more, but that's a different story.  Either way it wasn't a loss.

I next decided to have some lunch, and see how the day was going.  I was kicking myself for the paper hands, and decided I needed to go a little bigger.  I was trading cash, so I could only lose what I had on hand.

I decided that I needed a bigger return, and in order to do so, I needed something that was leveraged, and because NASDAQ was going crazy, TQQQ sounded like a good idea.

So I bought 20 contracts of TQQQ at 1.83 plus costs and fees.  I thought I wasn't going to let my paper hands get the better of me, so when it was up almost 1K, I decided to sell.

Made money for the day, and used all of my cash on hand for interday trading.  Time to just watch the market.

Paper hands yesterday cost me a good 4 or 5 K that I could have made instead of 1K, but a win is a win.

I log into my account today, and I get a message that I have a Good Faith Violation on my account.  I try to figure out why this happened, because I was only using what I though was my intraday buying power.  I was wrong.  So wrong.

My first call cost 1206.83 and my second cost 3673.66.  Those two together cost 4880.89 and was $0.07 over my cash on hand.  Because I had credits from winning trades, my broker allowed me to use the credit to purchase additional stocks.

So because this was my 3rd good faith violation in a year, I am now restricted to trading with cash on hand.  The active trader representative that I talked with shocked, but couldn't do anything about it because it is automatically flagged when this happens.",wallstreetbets,I got a Good Faith Violation for $0.07 today,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf6z6f/i_got_a_good_faith_violation_for_007_today/

 Zoom reports tonight and I think their report will be shit. They are expected to report USD 990 million in revenue, a 3.5% increase from the last quarter. I expect their revenue to drop from last quarter, leading to a selloff. 

Reason: use of Zoom is down as much as 33% in Q2 compared to Q1. To a degree this is expected due to seasonality/return to work, but I believe it will make it difficult for them to actually improve on their Q1 with these results 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people in countries with high vaccination rates have seen pretty dramatic drops in the popularity of the Zoom app recently:

**Reasons why this theory might not work out**

&amp;#x200B;

* It's already priced in 
* Options      are expensive and you get theta crushed
* Most of Zoom's revenue is      subscription (monthly/annual) based, not usage or volume based. A      decrease in call volumes in Q2 doesn’t mean that their revenue/earnings actually      decreased as dramatically as I’m predicting
* Analysts were already expecting      bad results and priced them in
* Zoom releases spectacular      numbers for Zoom phone, their new product that is meant to diversify their      offerings
* Cathie      Woods might buy out the company for USD 667 per share
* Zoom is already down a lot from      its ATH, it could also see a bounce back up

However, I believe it was because I didn't ask it properly so I was getting a lot of answers that were obvious and therefore made me look like an idiot. (Which I am)

My question is regarding what effects stock value (not supply and demand)

So if I'm a shop owner and I have a hundred units of item A that are on sale for $10 a unit, and somebody comes in and buys 50 of them, I, as the owner can decide to increase the cost of item A to reflect the supply and demand. As more people are interested in item A and as the supply goes down I can *choose* to increase the price from $10 to $20. The key point being I am the person raising and lowering the price based on the supply and demand.

Now in the stock market when there are a hundred stocks of A valued at $10 a stock and someone comes in and buys 50 of those stocks, therefore increasing the demand and lowering the supply, who or what is actually increasing the price? Basically where does the underlying algorithm come from that is actually responsible for instantaneously increasing and lowering stock prices upon purchasing and selling stocks?

That is my question: where does the algorithm come from that instantaneously increases and decreases stock value as people purchase and sell the stock directly affecting the supply and demand? How does it know where to put the price with each purchase and sell?",wallstreetbets,I have a question.,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peir2p/i_have_a_question/

When I want a fast charge during travel I charge at the Tesla Supercharger. 25-45 minutes charging then back on the road. After the charging is complete at a supercharger if you don't disconnect they charge you idle fees. You're basically bound to your car and feel a bit stressed knowing idle fees can happen.

Now... whenever I want to go somewhere for an extended period of time... I look for Volta chargers. Volta chargers let me plug in for free and the slower charging lets me keep my car there for longer. Peace of mind while charging. They are located in prime parking locations so will pretty much always be in use. They for sway where I would go. If I can go to a supermarket with a Volta charger then my trip is completely free. I would go to that supermarket over another without the charger.

Anything tech related that gives you peace of mind or makes something easier is a win. As an EV driver I prefer Volta charging over any other type of charging, except Tesla Supercharging while travelling long distances.

The charging is free, the ads are pretty cool, and people are taking selfies in front of them. They have swayed my travel destinations to locations with their chargers.

guzzledglizzy,t2_7f2q8arr,1630242716,pduz94,True,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pduz94/why_american_axle_and_manufacturing_axl_is/,1,"I hope to officially join the ranks of the upper-tier retards with this one, so let's talk about American Axle and Manufacturing, one of the few remaining automotive plays that almost nobody has talked about.

AAM is broken down into two main product lines: metal forming and driveline components. On metal forming, AAM is the largest automotive forging enterprise in the world. Its portfolio includes axle shafts, driveshafts, suspension components, and more. (Hint: these are all items used in vehicles now, as well as future all-electric and mild hybrid vehicles).

The driveline component product line is also massive, and to me the most critical piece of the business. If you don't own a vehicle with AAM driveline components in it, your next door neighbor probably does. And the person across the street. And your wife. And her boyfriend. Their product line includes numerous components like axles, disconnecting driveline technology, and the most important forward-looking piece: **electric and hybrid driveline components and systems.**

You see, it's not enough to be relevant now, and AAM knows that. Although it currently supplies a significant number of axles and driveline components to GM, Ford, Stellantis, Daimler, Hyundai, Honda, and others, its reach into the electrified world has already begun with customers such as Tesla and Electrameccanica. Even with all that said, what makes AAM particularly special to me is **GYNA.**

It should come as no surprise that China is the [world's largest automotive market](https://www.trade.gov/knowledge-product/china-automotive-industry).

[Chinese Automotive Sales](https://preview.redd.it/hi2lm743nak71.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a98c98cbbbddcf74cdab15b6226008bb3030e8)

It also should be no surprise that vehicle electrification in China is likely going to become a necessity much more rapidly than here in the U.S. So who did AAM seek partnership with? **Inovance Automotive**, a $190 billion Chinese industrial automation company that helps get AAM partnered with more Chinese automakers than ever before. This isn't some new, untested territory for AAM either, as they've already seen incredible success for supplying EDUs to vehicles like the [Jaguar I-Pace](https://www.caranddriver.com/jaguar/i-pace).

So who placed their faith in AAM? None other than one of your favorite retard plays [NIO](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/30/american-axle-and-manufacturing-ho-axl-q2-2021-ear/), of course. And if that's not retarded enough for you, they also have a deal with [REE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2021/05/07/american-axle-ree-to-jointly-develop-module-for-electric-vehicles/?sh=72b7f0141954) to develop electric drive modules. If you ask me, REE, a company working on items such as robotaxis ([Mommy Wood](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-cathie-wood-3000-price-target-robotaxi-2021-3) is a big fan of the idea), has a name that certainly fits with this sub.

[REE Modular Driveline](https://preview.redd.it/f4ecmp8eoak71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddd52ec2a757afb619ed11330bdb633742b9c3be)

So, let's talk financials. We'll get the big one out of the way first: debt. AAM has a metric fuckload of it, to the tune of $3.3 billion. Not exactly stellar with a projection of $5.3-5.5 billion in revenue this year. However, they have addressed this by paying down $360 million in debt just within the first two quarters of this year (that's 10% for those of you that can't do math), and plans to reach below a 2x debt leverage target as quickly as possible. And, it still earns 2.6x LT debt interest with EBIT, so it's not in the hole on its interest, it just lags the industry.

Where it shouldn't take such a penalty is P/E ratio. Not always the best way to try to figure out the true price of a stock, but there's still points where it should flag as undervalued. Case and point, AAM trades at a P/E ratio of 5.06 when the Auto Parts industry average is [27.43](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html). That's just stupid low, especially when industry players are companies like Workhorse (WKHS), Luminar (LAZR), and QuantumScape (QS). Just how low is it? Average analyst price target is $11.50/share, which still undercuts the industry average P/E at 20.84.

The reality is, I just don't see how this is a below-average company. It's being priced at some of the old kids' levels (i.e. BorgWarner and Dana) even though its forward looking prospects in the EV and MHEV (Mild Hybrid EV) space are huge. According to CEO David Dauch in the most recent quarterly earnings report, 80% of their current quoted business has shifted to the EV/MHEV space, and that's good enough for me to see they aren't a dinosaur company after all.

tl;dr

I think AXL will go uppies, especially as the semiconductor shortage begins to work itself out in 2022 and automakers turn production lines up to full force. I hold shares at an average cost of $8.51. If I wasn't $60k in student loan debt I'd have a fuckload of 1/22 $11c, but I'm too broke to bet like some of you retards and I have a baby on the way, so shares it is.

Now I know we are all sick of the word “squeeze” but this one has a real possibility of happening. WKHS has been falling off since its peak in late June and has started rising as of mid August - currently WKHS has one of the highest short interest % of all stocks and is primed for a Gamma squeeze into Short squeeze (keep reading).


Recently WKHS has crossed the flipping point for Market Makers to start Gamma hedging - this happens when the price of the underlying starts to increase and the calls they sold to us retards start to become ITM so they are forced to buy shares to “cover” their calls. What this does is cause volume spikes as they buy more shares as more calls become ITM - increasing the stock price. This has already begun.

Gamma Exposure Flipping point:

A short squeeze could be triggered due to this Gamma Hedging if the Market Makers are forced to hedge against calls at multiple strikes. This will trigger a squeeze scenario like we saw in January (not as severe but a squeeze nonetheless).

# The mobile gaming market

Mobile gaming accounts for over 50% of all video gaming revenue worldwide. In the US, one of the largest gaming markets in the world, mobile gaming revenue reached \~$11B in 2020. It’s expected that the global share of mobile gaming will continue to rise even in relation to the rest of global gaming growth.

https://preview.redd.it/gif44y4jbbk71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f026cdb33eb7c4b70852ac0460c53b25315bd4aa

&amp;#x200B;

In the US specifically, there has been an increased in global mobile gaming revenue share. Over the years, it has overtaken Japan as the largest mobile gaming market globally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics**

The demographics of mobile gaming has been rapidly changing over the years and, especially in the US, is no longer what one would traditionally expect. For example, children and young adults aged 16-24 no longer make up the majority of mobile gamers. In fact, over a third of all mobile gamers are aged 45+. Furthermore, while 66% of men play mobile games, 70% of women play mobile games. Market research into gaming and spend indicate that older adults spend both more money and time in video games.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, the most valuable demographic for mobile gaming is actually the female aged 45+ market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Popular game trends**

The most popular category of games is the “hyper-casual” games where users download ten times more games in that category than average. The most profitable mobile games in North America are actually puzzle games capturing 22% of the total North American mobile gaming revenue. AR (augmented reality) /Location-based games represent the smallest market in terms of North American revenue at (2.83%).

# Where SKLZ stands

**The bull case**

SKLZ is appropriately positioned to capture the correct demographic of gamers for the highest revenue. According to their 10-K, over 50% of their users are 45+ with \~10% of their users being aged 18-25. Furthermore, the majority of their users are women.

Beyond that, gamers who use the SKLZ platform are spending more time on the game or other SKLZ games than on TikTok, Facebook, or YouTube. They spend over 3x the amount of time they would spend on a SKLZ game than an average mobile game!

They are still on track for their India expansion which represents a massive injection of revenue possible. Furthermore, SKLZ is attempting to expand out of card games and into racing, shooting, and battle-royale type games as well.

Lastly, SKLZ’s current per-user revenue has increased by over 60%. They are successfully monetizing their current user-base and increasing the amount of revenues they gain from that user-base.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The bear case**

Most recently in Q2 2021, nearly three-quarters of SKLZ’s revenues comes from just 3 games: Solitaire Cube, 21 Blitz, and Blackout Bingo. In general, a handful of games has contributed to the majority of SKLZ’s revenues and this has remained consistent over the past 5 years! This represents a significant risk as it shows that SKLZ is not able to innovate away from its cash cows and as the mobile games grow out of popularity, SKLZ will not have any way to make up for lost revenues.

SKLZ is paying record amounts of money in terms of customer acquisition through marketing. However, their monthly active users is actually dropping from 2020 to 2021. In fact, SKLZ has currently spent more in marketing than the previous year’s total revenues! Yet, they are losing users. This is extremely worrisome about SKLZ’s ability to continue their rapid growth.

Lastly, SKLZ has currently only proven its market in a small segment of the mobile market. SKLZ, by definition of its platform, must operate in player vs. player games (one of the most unpopular categories of mobile gaming) which accounts for around 15% of the market. Furthermore, SKLZ has only proven itself in the arcade gaming market which accounts for 5% of North America’s revenue market. In general, SKLZ has only proven themselves in a sliver of the mobile gaming market.

&amp;#x200B;

# The financials

**Income statement**

Revenue growth in SKLZ continues to be extremely impressive, doubling every year (and on track to double again this year).

https://preview.redd.it/65x5svm2dbk71.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015cf3d5f5132c43e52a5849526dbeb3cae3696a

&amp;#x200B;

However, we are also seeing marketing costs increase at more than the rate of revenues which is an extremely worrisome rate. Marketing has increased spend by over 100% per year and are on track to far exceed that this year.

https://preview.redd.it/bnrj4r13dbk71.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07bfeccecfc9cd7d4b31181873ac2b9f231b0361

&amp;#x200B;

This is especially worrisome as it means that SKLZ is spending more dollars in marketing than its receiving back because of the marketing. Also, because this is a multi-year trend, it doesn’t look like marketing is paying off even in the long term. As a result, SKLZ is losing money at an increasing rate every year.

https://preview.redd.it/slwsiph3dbk71.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b89b0a1d1b2d9f23fc86062135d9430a2249795

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance sheet**

SKLZ sports a decently healthy balance sheet. It has over $700M in current assets with only $125M of current liabilities. This leaves SKLZ with $575M of additional cash or other liquid assets to operate with. While this is a lot of money, SKLZ is on track to burn over $300M in net losses in 2021 which will reduce this amount by over one half. Furthermore, the reason SKLZ has such a high current asset is because it has already sold additional stock in order to finance its operations. In 2021, SKLZ raised over $400M by offering new stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash flow**

SKLZ has awful cash flows due to it burning money through its operations. It’s only positive cash flow over the past few years has been through financing, which means that SKLZ survives only by offering additional shares and using that money in its operations.

https://preview.redd.it/8xffatxcdbk71.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1af6775163b1ff7be555c82010fe63e5aa70b116

This should be a glaring red flag for any current investor in SKLZ.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Outlook

SKLZ has an interesting position to capture a high value demographic within the mobile gaming market. However, they are doing so within the smallest categories that are popular within their demographic. They have the ability to expand into other categories, but as they are not a mobile game development company, they aren’t able to deliberately expand into other types of games. They must depend on 3rd party developers choosing to use their platform while developing more popular categories of games for them.

What is most worrisome for me is their cash losses and their inability to sustain their operations without additional financing activity. I would expect SKLZ to further dilute their stock (and drag down their stock price) in order to finance their operations next year as well.

Lastly, I am uncertain about SKLZ’s ability to capture other hit games beyond their current cash cows. Once more, SKLZ has little control of this as they do not build games themselves and are reliant on the market choosing them with popular games. In this way, there is a great risk that their current cash cows will get phased out due to age and the newer games will not utilize SKLZ as a platform. If that happens, SKLZ will lose 75% of its revenues.

# Motivation

I’d been wondering for a while how well the DD’s line up with when to buy on Reddit and have been putting data together on this sort of stuff already, so doing the analysis was a natural step. It's a little bit like the classic guessing the number of jelly beans in the jar / wisdom of the crowds question. 

# How It Works

Let’s take a set of posts as an example. Some days have a few, some days have none. The key question is whether there’s information in when the posts are happening. 

For every post, we can compute the PnL as if you had bought GME after reading it. By associating the post date with the stock price, I computed the 1 week percentage return and 1 month percentage return in the time following posting. For example, after each post, what’s the % return of GME in a week? A month?

I use a simple approximation where I assume you can trade in at the price of the nearest close after the post time. Here's a plot of the count of posts and the price of GME. 

[Price and Number of GME DDs](https://preview.redd.it/0aen5nlkabk71.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d2caee18fb53a347c4952516e7bf255f7e73670)

# Comparison Set Up

\# Candidate #1: Reddit DDs

I took just under 3000 DDs on GME made over the last two years. The distribution is clearly not uniformly random throughout time, instead our DDs cluster together as seen above. These are posts that are flaired as DD, so it's only a portion of all the posts about GME more generally.  

\# Candidate #2: Random (Baseline)

If you were just randomly deciding to trade on any given day in the same period, every day is equally likely. In that case, computing the baseline average returns / risk comes down to just computing the mean + std over the whole time period. 

# Results

Putting it all together, we can see that the overall returns for holding 1 week / 1 month after each DD are larger than just buying any/every day. These times are riskier as well. By computing the Sharpe Ratio (return/risk) we can put it on equal footing and see that trading after DDs has done better at the 1 month window and about the same at 1 week.

**IAM Media scoop on Friday (legit site specializing in Intellectual Property that first broke the $BB patent sale news 9 months ago)** 

[https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-september-2021](https://www.iam-media.com/finance/blackberry-patent-sale-september-2021)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual\_Asset\_Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Asset_Management)

""Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It’s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry’s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents “relating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies”, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these – or the many other stories doing the rounds – are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note – the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

Despite that fact it has only created 2 good trades other triggers ended up as false starts or balks.

8/24 there was a midday alert that had gone off. The break of $40 was the new trigger.

Volume instantly came in and because of the unique structure of this stock i manage it slightly different than i do the others. The main difference is that i am willing to scale out of my position rather than trail for one exit, the reason for it is the exaggerated rotation of the float and the rogue wave like volume increases. In other words AMC is ironically the only stock where my hands are in diamond form for the least amount of time.

The price point on the chart i was most interested in was the level just under 50. It was noted to be a significant area of price and volume. I was very confident that if this level were to break we would be seeing a major moon run as the imbalance of supply and demand above this point would be near its most extreme.

Bruce Lee said ""Hands like water"" .... No not really, he said ""...be like water"" a parallel quote we find in our game is "" Strong opinions weakly held"" the quote has been attributed to many traders so i haven't verified the source, though i did first hear it in one of the market wizards book, but if Bruce was a trader i believe he'd say ""true dat"".. Once that target was hit i used it to scale and to adjust my stops. Once the market closes i resume my diamond hand status until the price action tells me different.

I was disappointed when AMC could not break that level on day 2, i really wanted to see this MOON, but the market doesn't give a flying F$%# what any of us wants, i takes money from us on our birthdays, the day of our grandmas funeral and would rip our faces off even if our dog got hit by a garbage truck.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2 i was stopped out pretty quickly. There was a gut check when the stock rallied back towards the high. The best part was i had an order ready to get back in, it wasn't filled and the stock fizzled out of favor.

I wouldn't normally do this, but since you cucks apparently need to be verbally abused with tired insults to get a hard-on about a stonk, I’m going to take a different tack.

**Listen up, you fellow big dumb degenerate apes.** HIMX making record earnings quarter after quarter and is cartoonishly undervalued right now.

Unless you’ve been consumed by your wife’s boyfriend giving her the sexual pleasure that she desperately craves but you cannot possibly provide, you know that the semiconductor sector is white-hot right now due to a semiconductor shortage that is expected to last at least through 2022.

Lots of semiconductor stocks have already taken off and are selling at a price a little too rich for my blood: (see NVDA, AMD, and SIMO). If you rode those rockets, congratulations and fuck you. Others are nascent, selling at a relatively low dollar price and show some promise but are still losing money and have a long way to go before they make a profit (INDI). Some others are making money, but just not that much.

Then there’s HIMX. It’s a Goldilocks: nice small-cap company, not too young, not a dinosaur. It has existing products on the market, with established ties to major customers, virtually no long-term debt. It's affordable, and it’s starting to edge near $1 EPS quarterly. Although it is up something like over 200% from last year, there’s still lots of upside potential and minimal downside. This rocket is still parked at the launch site, fueled up, and is waiting to moon to 400%-600% its current value.

**What the Hell Does HIMX Do?**

HIMX is a fabless semiconductor company focused on visual imaging processing technologies. The company based in Tainan, Taiwan—and because I’m a red-blooded American patriot, I know that’s not in Communist China, and this is not a commie company controlled by Xi’s minions. It also has offices in Irvine, CA; Campbell, CA; and Minneapolis, MN; Israel; Tokyo; and South Korea.

HIMX 200+ customers across Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, U.S. and Europe. Maybe you have heard of a few of them, little outfits like Amazon, Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, Foxconn, Microsoft, Philips, Epson, LG Display, Lenovo, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, Sharp, Mercedes Benz, and Jaguar.

It has 3,023 patents granted and 503 patents pending approval worldwide as of June 30, 2021. It has 2,000 employees worldwide; more than 90% are engineers. If HIMX has halfway decent IP covenants, every brilliant idea any one of those 2,000 engineers comes up with belongs to HIMX.

HIMX’s product line includes TFT-LCD Drivers, EPD Drivers, Micro LED Drivers and AMOLED Drivers ▪ TCON and Bridge IC ▪ Touch Controllers ▪ Pure in-cell Touch (TDDI) ▪ AIoT Edge AI Processors ▪ 3D Decoder Processors ▪ ASIC Service and IP Licensing ▪ Power Management ICs, PGamma OP, Level Shifter and LED Driver ▪ Wafer Level Optics and 3D Sensing Modules ▪ In-house Color Filter Fab for LCoS and CIS ▪ LCoS Modules for HeadMounted Display, Head-up Display and Pico-projector Applications ▪ Phase Modulation for Communication, Holographic Displays and AR-HUD ▪ CMOS Image Sensors ▪ Ultralow Power Always-on (AOS) CMOS Image Sensors.

**Solid Earnings, Solid Growth Outlook, and Highly Undervalued**

About two weeks ago, I looked at every semiconductor company’s fundamentals being traded on the U.S. stock exchanges, and to my knowledge **HIMX had (1) the lowest P/E (9.95); (2) the lowest forward P/E (3.77 – that’s not a typo)**; and **the fourth lowest price of any semiconductor company, regardless of size**. All this, with phenomenal growth prospects for the sector through 2022. *Since then, the stock went down about 8%.*

Now, if you looked at my first post in this cesspool you call a “community”, you might say I’m a smooth-brained retard who was totally wrong about the stock price going up after Q2 earnings. “30-to-40% profit, you said."" ""In a matter of days, you said.” To that I say, (1) I know I’m am a smooth-brained retard; (2) I’m not wrong, I’m just early; and (3) the stock went up from to $14.80ish before shorts knee-capped it and brought the share price tumbling down to $11.80ish. Anyway, if you made the idiotic not to YOLO this stock then, good for you. Now the share price is lower; the P/E is lower; the forward P/E is a ridiculously, insanely low. So YOLO now.

**Near-term, Mid-term, and Long-term (1yr) Catalysts and Short Squeeze Opportunity**

The most obvious catalyst is Q3 Earnings in October (if pre-announced) or November. I know, I said last quarter would be a catalyst and that was a flop. But there’s a pretty good reason why this quarter will be different. If HIMX just meets the low-end Q3 EPS estimates (75 – 81 cents/share), HIMX’s TTM EPS will go from $1.25 to $2.00. If HIMX beats its estimates (as it has done for the past 4-5 quarters) and hits 84 cents/share in Q3 EPS, the TTM EPS will jump to over $2.00. Even if HIMX kept its absurdly low P/E of 9-10, one would expect the share price to jump to $18-20—in a rational world.

Other soft catalysts are several institutional investor conferences scheduled for September 2021, including Deutsche Bank’s dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021. For some reason, a bunch of analysts have not updated any of their price guidance despite HIMX’s solid performance. Maybe they are letting their buddies/customers establish a position before publishing. But once they do, look out.

Mid-term catalyst is Q4 earnings and revised 2022 EPS estimates. If HIMX just meets this number in Q4—and there’s every reason to believe HIMX will do better—TTM EPS will jump to $2.84. Even if HIMX kept its absurdly low P/E of 9-10, one would expect the share price to jump to $28.40. At industry averages of around 15-20 P/E, you’re looking at a share price in the $35-50 range. And if HIMX can simply maintain quarterly EPS at 80 cents per share, you’re looking at a 2022 EPS estimate of $3.60. The current EPS estimate, which I think is low, is $3.30.

If HIMX’s upward earnings trend continues, HIMX’s 2022 EPS consensus could hit +$4.00 to 4.50. I expect it will, because semiconductor companies are jacking up prices for customers, who are more than willing to pay, and HIMX is trying to expand its capacity somewhat for 2022.

But HIMX just keeps doing what it’s doing, you’re looking at fair valuations based on industry averages in the realm of $50 – 74.00/share next year.

Another catalyst (\~1 year out) is the annual dividend. HIMX historically has paid out a large percentage of its earnings in the form of an annual dividend. This dividend has ranged from 51 – 119%. In the majority of dividend-paying years, HIMX has doled out 75 – 80 percent. This year, HIMX resumed its dividend and paid out 100% of last year’s earnings. Although HIMX is unlikely to do this again, and I actually wouldn’t want them to, a 75-percent-of-2021-EPS dividend in 2022 assuming a TTM EPS of 2.84 is $2.06. That’s a 16% yield at the current price.

And finally, what may be the biggest and best long-term catalyst: the growing automotive semiconductor segment, in which HIMX forecasts “exponential growth.”

On this point, here’s something I found on the internet, so it must be true:

“The global automotive semiconductor market was valued at USD 48.13 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a value of USD 129.17 billion by 2026 and grow at a CAGR of 17.94% over the forecast period (2021-2026).

The industry has also witnessed improvements in 3D mapping applications, EV batteries, and augmented-reality technologies, such as head-up displays. Moreover, 5G networks are enabling the next generation of mobility solutions in the sector. ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) sales are expected to flourish in the future owing to rising demand for safety features, designed to avoid collisions and accidents by offering technologies that alert the driver about potential problems.

Moreover, connected vehicles are the key drivers for consumers accustomed to rich user experiences. The resulting expectations have triggered a transformation in infotainment systems from bulky, purpose-built devices into sleek, connected, upgradeable, and integrated platforms, and they require the latest technology-featured semiconductors. Thus, the future of connected and autonomous cars is expected to create potential opportunities for the semiconductor industry.”

HIMX has 10% market share for Driver ICs for mass-market devices, including about 30% market share in the automotive segment. HIMX reports that “Himax’s \[Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chips have been\] selected by many leading tier-1 and OEMs for their upcoming first launches of new vehicles. Expect meaningful production shipments from 2021 and into 2022.”

**Short Squeeze Potential?**

Despite record rising earnings and someone (or some people) is keeping this stock down, flooding the market with shares just about every morning. Since May 2021, and again despite record top- and bottom-line growth, short float has gone up—and quite a bit--like 12% according to finviz.

I won’t pretend to know exactly what is going on. There is a theory floating around on Stocktwits that some big short got trapped in Q1 2021, when HIMX’s share price basically doubled. The theory goes that instead of closing its position and realizing the loss, the short, alone or with the assistance of others, just keeps shorting more and more shares. Some are speculating short is banking on demand for semiconductors to drop and HIMX’s gross margin falling back to historical levels. Perhaps the short is hoping for a major correction in the market. Maybe the short is working in coordination with institutional investors to grab shares at lower prices.

I’ll leave it to other degenerates to get to the bottom of this. It’s undeniable that someone is deliberately keeping this stock price down. And so HIMX is starting to look like a reasonable short squeeze candidate, when you consider all the upcoming catalysts. At some point, the fundamentals should prevail.

**Potential Revolutionary Tech**

Back in 2019, Himax teamed up with Bill Gates-backed Lumotive for developing improved LIDAR systems. Dr William Colleran, Lumotive co-founder and CEO, said, “Our combined approach is an innovative technological advance that lowers cost, improves performance and ultimately speeds time-to-market for reliable lidar systems that make self-driving cars viable and safe.” [https://spectrum.ieee.org/lumotive-says-its-got-a-solidstate-lidar-that-really-works](https://spectrum.ieee.org/lumotive-says-its-got-a-solidstate-lidar-that-really-works). I honestly don’t know what the hell happened with this product, as I haven’t heard much about it since all the press releases. This market is still in its early phases, so it’s hard to say who is going to come out on top here. Maybe some wrinkle-brain nerd can tell me why Lumotive-HIMX are offering a garbage product with no hope of catching on.

But the overall point is that HIMX is also a leader and long-term innovator of Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) displays and one of the companies capable of high-volume production runs of LCoS displays for the launch of mass-market devices, such as automotive head-up displays, AR/VR smart glasses, and LiDAR technology for autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles.

I don’t know- what will happen with this sector. Who really does? But I’m not buying HIMX until it hurts—and then buying more—based on some speculative moonshot. I’m buying because HIMX is already making products that are in high demand; killing earnings quarter after quarter; and is projected to continue killing earnings for at least the next year and a half. But being buddies with a Gates-backed startup is a great relationship to have in this area, and this is exactly the type of latent innovation that could help HIMX go interstellar.

**Conclusion**

I’m sincerely sorry if you are allergic to making money and don’t want to hear all this. I thought this was the place where we all are trying to get fuck-you rich in the hopes that your wife will find you attractive again. You think the stock market is a casino? Buying HIMX long is about as stupidly easy a bet you can make; the house is showing its hand. Alternatively, you can pour money into hype-ass, speculative “growth” stocks like $RIDE that haven't begun commercial production for a single product, hemorrhage losses every quarter, and are bound for bankruptcy. I don't care if the board hires Jesus Christ himself to take the wheel as CEO.

It’s your call. Speaking of calls, don’t run options—or only options—on HIMX. Whoever is shorting this stock will just continue to manipulate the stock price at will, and you’ll stay OTM.

**TLDR:**

Buy HIMX

 Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame

It’s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:

During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.

Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.

So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry’s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents “relating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies”, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.

Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.

Our understanding, though, is that neither of these – or the many other stories doing the rounds – are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.

The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.

However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.

Note – the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.

It was great DD done and if you listened then you probably are rich now. I've linked below to the original thread where he made the call. 


Its definitely worth a looksee. The comments are great too

&gt;Hello. On August 12th, something very strange happened. The url amazon.com/affirm no longer led to an error message. In fact, it redirects to a link that says ""Pay over time with Affirm"" in the tab title, and, if you're on the app it says ""Search in Pay over time with Affirm"" in the search bar. ipad view: https://imgur.com/rGLmrwy

&gt;If you do a ""view page source"" you can ctrl+F and see the ""08-12"" that verifies that this url was set up on 8/12.

&gt;Now let's explore the url it redirects to. It has a specific ""node ID"" in it. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23376591011

&gt;Upon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product. For instance, this is what the url for their Kindle overview page looks like: https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17717476011 An identical URL with a different node ID.

&gt;It seems very unlikely they set up a specific node ID url if something wasn't brewing.

&gt;Now lets look at other evidence. A few months ago, someone noticed during checkout the word ""option"" that had not been there before, yet there was only one pay over time option. See the third line down: https://imgur.com/g0jqN4c

&gt;Someone also noticed that when you used to search for ""Amazon Affirm"" on google it used to come up with a robo-generated search result mentioning Affirm. They do this with basically anything you search to generate clicks. But, a couple months ago, this robo-generated search result removed as if they were trying to hide something. Here is what used to come up: https://imgur.com/3uE52wt

&gt;So what could all this mean? It could be something as simple as Amazon will promote Affirm's upcoming debit card on their website, but why would they promote a competing card? At the moment Amazon only offers their own cards. Or.. it could be a full-blown partnership or buyout. We don't know, but something is going on.

&gt;Also, don't question why I was routinely visiting error message URLs. I have no life and was hoping one day I'd find something and I did.

**Solid Earnings, Solid Growth Outlook, and Highly Undervalued**

About two weeks ago, I looked at every semiconductor company’s fundamentals being traded on the U.S. stock exchanges, and to my knowledge **HIMX had (1) the lowest P/E (9.95); (2) the lowest forward P/E (3.77 – that’s not a typo)**; and **the fourth lowest price of any semiconductor company, regardless of size**. All this, with phenomenal growth prospects for the sector through 2022. *Since then, the stock went down about 8%.*

Now, if you looked at my first post in this cesspool you call a “community”, you might say I’m a smooth-brained pump-and-dump retard who was totally wrong about the stock price going up after Q2 earnings. “30-to-40% profit, you said."" ""In a matter of days, you said.” To that I say, (1) I know I’m am a smooth-brained retard; (2) I was wrong about the price movement,  but I'm not wrong generally; I’m just early; and (3) the stock went up from to $14.80ish before shorts knee-capped it and brought the share price tumbling down to $11.80ish. Anyway, if you made the idiotic not to YOLO this stock then, good for you. Now the share price is lower; the P/E is lower; the forward P/E is a ridiculously, insanely low. So YOLO now.

**Near-term, Mid-term, and Long-term (1yr) Catalysts and Short Squeeze Opportunity**

The most obvious catalyst is Q3 Earnings in October (if pre-announced) or November. I know, I said last quarter would be a catalyst and that was a flop. But there’s a pretty good reason why this quarter will be different. If HIMX just meets the low-end Q3 EPS estimates (75 – 81 cents/share), HIMX’s TTM EPS will go from $1.25 to $2.00. If HIMX beats its estimates (as it has done for the past 4-5 quarters) and hits 84 cents/share in Q3 EPS, the TTM EPS will jump to over $2.00. Even if HIMX kept its absurdly low P/E of 9-10, one would expect the share price to jump to $18-20—in a rational world.

Other soft catalysts are several institutional investor conferences scheduled for September 2021, including Deutsche Bank’s dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021. For some reason, a bunch of analysts have not updated any of their price guidance despite HIMX’s solid performance. Maybe they are letting their buddies/customers establish a position before publishing. But once they do, look out.

Mid-term catalyst is Q4 earnings and revised 2022 EPS estimates. If HIMX just meets this number in Q4—and there’s every reason to believe HIMX will do better—TTM EPS will jump to $2.84. Even if HIMX kept its absurdly low P/E of 9-10, one would expect the share price to jump to $28.40. At industry averages of around 15-20 P/E, you’re looking at a share price in the $35-50 range. And if HIMX can simply maintain quarterly EPS at 80 cents per share, you’re looking at a 2022 EPS estimate of $3.60. The current EPS estimate, which I think is low, is $3.30.

If HIMX’s upward earnings trend continues, HIMX’s 2022 EPS consensus could hit +$4.00 to 4.50. I expect it will, because semiconductor companies are jacking up prices for customers, who are more than willing to pay, and HIMX is trying to expand its capacity somewhat for 2022.

But HIMX just keeps doing what it’s doing, you’re looking at fair valuations in the realm of $50 – 74.00/share next year.

Another catalyst (\~1 year out) is the annual dividend. HIMX historically has paid out a large percentage of its earnings in the form of an annual dividend. This dividend has ranged from 51 – 119%. In the majority of dividend-paying years, HIMX has doled out 75 – 80 percent. This year, HIMX resumed its dividend and paid out 100% of last year’s earnings. Although HIMX is unlikely to do this again, and I actually wouldn’t want them to, a 75-percent-of-2021-EPS dividend in 2022 assuming a TTM EPS of 2.84 is $2.06. That’s a 16% yield at the current price.

And finally, what may be the biggest and best long-term catalyst: the growing automotive semiconductor segment, in which HIMX forecasts “exponential growth.”

On this point, here’s something I found on the internet, so it must be true:

“The global automotive semiconductor market was valued at USD 48.13 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a value of USD 129.17 billion by 2026 and grow at a CAGR of 17.94% over the forecast period (2021-2026).

The industry has also witnessed improvements in 3D mapping applications, EV batteries, and augmented-reality technologies, such as head-up displays. Moreover, 5G networks are enabling the next generation of mobility solutions in the sector. ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) sales are expected to flourish in the future owing to rising demand for safety features, designed to avoid collisions and accidents by offering technologies that alert the driver about potential problems.

Moreover, connected vehicles are the key drivers for consumers accustomed to rich user experiences. The resulting expectations have triggered a transformation in infotainment systems from bulky, purpose-built devices into sleek, connected, upgradeable, and integrated platforms, and they require the latest technology-featured semiconductors. Thus, the future of connected and autonomous cars is expected to create potential opportunities for the semiconductor industry.”

HIMX has 10% market share for Driver ICs for mass-market devices, including about 30% market share in the automotive segment. HIMX reports that “Himax’s \[Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chips have been\] selected by many leading tier-1 and OEMs for their upcoming first launches of new vehicles. Expect meaningful production shipments from 2021 and into 2022.”

**Small Short Squeeze Potential**

Despite record rising earnings and someone (or some people) is keeping this stock down, flooding the market with shares just about every morning. Since May 2021, and again despite record top- and bottom-line growth, short interest has gone up—and quite a bit. It’s not GME levels, but it’s like 12% according s.

I won’t pretend to know exactly what is going on. There is a theory floating around on Stocktwits that some big short got trapped in Q1 2021, when HIMX’s share price basically doubled. The theory goes that instead of closing its position and realizing the loss, the short, alone or with the assistance of others, just keeps shorting more and more shares. Some are speculating short is banking on demand for semiconductors to drop and HIMX’s gross margin falling back to historical levels. Perhaps the short is hoping for a major correction in the market. Maybe the short is working in coordination with institutional investors to grab shares at lower prices.

I’ll leave it to other degenerates to get to the bottom of this. It’s undeniable that someone is deliberately keeping this stock price down. And so HIMX is starting to look like a reasonable short squeeze candidate, when you consider all the upcoming catalysts. At some point, the fundamentals should prevail.

**Potential Revolutionary Tech**

Back in 2019, Himax teamed up with Bill Gates-backed Lumotive for developing improved LIDAR systems. Dr William Colleran, Lumotive co-founder and CEO, said, “Our combined approach is an innovative technological advance that lowers cost, improves performance and ultimately speeds time-to-market for reliable lidar systems that make self-driving cars viable and safe.” [https://spectrum.ieee.org/lumotive-says-its-got-a-solidstate-lidar-that-really-works](https://spectrum.ieee.org/lumotive-says-its-got-a-solidstate-lidar-that-really-works). I honestly don’t know what the hell happened with this product, as I haven’t heard much about it since all the press releases. This market is still in its early phases, so it’s hard to say who is going to come out on top here. Maybe some wrinkle-brain nerd can tell me why Lumotive-HIMX are offering a garbage product with no hope of catching on.

But the overall point is that HIMX is also a self-proclaimed ""leader and long-term innovator of Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) displays and one of the companies capable of high-volume production runs of LCoS displays for the launch of mass-market devices"", such as automotive head-up displays, AR/VR smart glasses, and LiDAR technology for autonomous/semiautonomous vehicles.

I don’t know if any of this tech will become a huge money-maker for HIMX. But I’m not buying HIMX until it hurts—and then buying more—based on some speculative moonshot. I’m buying because HIMX is already making products that are in high demand; killing earnings quarter after quarter; and is projected to continue killing earnings for at least the next year and a half. But being buddies with a Gates-backed startup is a great relationship to have in this area, and this is exactly the type of latent innovation that could help HIMX go interstellar.

**Conclusion**

I’m sincerely sorry if you are allergic to making money and don’t want to hear all this. I thought this was the place where we all are trying to get fuck-you rich in the hopes that your wife will find you attractive again. You think the stock market is a casino? Buying HIMX long is about as stupidly easy a bet you can make; the house is showing its hand. Alternatively, you can pour money into a truly speculative “growth” stocks like that haven't begun commercial production for a single product, hemorrhages losses every quarter, and are bound for bankruptcy.

**TLDR:**

Smile direct club is one of the worlds largest 3D printing manufacturer and is disrupting the field of orthodontics with it’s clear Aligners.

Any time a company tries to disrupt a business model they will be met with resistance. Invisalign (ALGN) had a very difficult time marketing their product in early 2000s as the dental field was very unwelcoming to them.

The journey to success has been even more difficult for Smile Direct Club as they go one step further to change the field of orthodontics by offering direct to consumer Aligners.

When selling aligners at a fraction of the cost of Invisalign there is a large financial loss to the Invisalign company(ALGN) and dental professionals.

Key patents that protected Invisalign’s design and manufacturing expired in October 2017. Another patent that gave Invisalign an edge and allowed them to work directly with Dentists expired in January 2020.
Smile direct club has since then signed up with over one thousand dental offices, working directly with Dentists and offering their clear aligners.

This model is a win-win for both Smile direct club and Dental professionals. Consumers can now go to a dental office and get examined and scanned for Aligners.
Dentists will benefit from a flow of new patients to their clinic from Smile direct club and can clear them from cavities and periodontal disease before starting them on Aligners.
In addition the Dentist gets $300 from Smile direct club if the patient decides to proceed with the Aligners. The dentist is also released from all liability the moment patient agrees to continue their care with Smile direct club

This model is also beneficial to smile direct club. Reluctant patients that are worried about “unsupervised care”; a bad stigma created by the competition, can now comfortably walk into a dental office and get screened by a dentist.

Now, it’s important to understand that not all patients qualify for SDC aligners. They are very clear with the type of teeth that they are able to correct, which is mild to moderate crowding.   Severe and complex cases would still need to be seen by an orthodontist.  

50% of my patients are patients with mild crowding that would need a simple correction.  If I can reach an optimal result for my patient and yet save them half the cost then I think that is the right thing to do, ethically.

SDC has in the past 12 months further partnered with major retailers including Walmart, Walgreens and CVS; setting up their smile-shops and selling their dental products (teeth whitening and tooth brushes) directly to consumers.

Also in the past 12 month they have expanded internationally to Spain, Singapore, Hong Kong,  Austria, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand,  United Kingdom, Canada, Costa Rica, Ireland.

Smile direct club is now rapidly adapting this model and capturing market share on international level, which in turn will generate massive revenue in the future. 

Smile direct club stock has been hit hard ever since it IPO’d at $23 in September 2019. In my opinion smiledirectclub has the potential to 5x fairly easily considering it’s depressed market cap of $4.57B at 30% short float (a potential for a major squeeze).  The negative sentiments from media and Dental communities has made it hard for the stock to recover. It’s important to point out that no dental board or association have been successful with lawsuits against smile direct club and many are now coming to the realization that they can not fight the monopoly that their member dentists have had in this market.

With good technical support and great prospectives I believe smile direct club stock has turned the corner and has a bright future ahead.

I’d urge everyone to do their own due diligence as this is not investment advice. This is just a dentist’s two cents. 🦷 🦷",wallstreetbets,Smile direct club $sdc - a DD by a dentist,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pcn101/smile_direct_club_sdc_a_dd_by_a_dentist/

Good morning Lady Apes, Gentle Apes, Retards, and Autists.

I’m an Autist (like, in real life) with a Golden Retriever, and I want to share Due Diligence on Humanigen (HGEN).

⚠️**: This is not financial advice, and quite frankly, it should not be read by anyone.**

I realize most of you have trouble reading, and many never even noticed u/yolocallking [Chad Money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nk3jy3/wsb_presents_chad_money/) series included words, so I’ve asked someone else to help get the message across, as memes.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hello! I’m here to tell you about Humanigen.](https://i.redd.it/vkvn4ke0fwj71.gif)

**Her name is Dr. Steph O**’**Scope.**

And for those who find reading is too complicated, she will make it easier to follow along. 👍

I don’t know if this has ever been done before, but think of it as a DD explained with memes.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ok. Let's get started! HGEN is Humanigen. It's a biopharmaceutical company.](https://i.redd.it/6mvg9pn2fwj71.gif)

**What is Humanigen?**

It is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.

⚠️: It’s not your Boomer stock. Period.

**Why would I care about Humanigen?**

Here’s a link to their current [clinical-stage pipeline](https://www.humanigen.com/pipeline). Although the one we’re focusing on right now is Lenzilumab. Specifically, their LIVE-AIR indication for prevention, treatment of hyper-inflammation, and cytokine storms.

&amp;#x200B;

[HGEN has something called Lenzilumab.](https://i.redd.it/28o2ijs8fwj71.gif)

**What is Lenzilumab?**

It is a humanized monoclonal antibody (class IgG1 kappa) that targets colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2)/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

Here’s the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenzilumab).

**Why would I care about Lenzilumab?**

Lenzilumab is a therapy for hospitalized, hypoxic COVID-19 patients.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lenzilumab is a treatment for COVID-19.](https://i.redd.it/di9he1xbfwj71.gif)

**Let’s go back in time and understand Lenzilumab’s history.**

Lenzilumab was originally designed to treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

Then over a year ago, COVID-19 hit, and doctors started to notice the plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines, known as a cytokine storm.

And that’s what Lenzilumab was created for—to work against cytokine storm!

&amp;#x200B;

[Lenzilumab works against cytokine storm.](https://i.redd.it/m9bph6qffwj71.gif)

**Lenzilumab already had Phase I and Phase II studies.**

Humanigen did not start to create something from scratch because of COVID-19. They already had Lenzilumab.

[Quoting Dr. Cameron Durrant](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-03-27/humanigen-submits-phase-iii-protocol-synopsis-to-fda-for-lenzilumab-for-coronavirus-treatment), chief executive officer of Humanigen:

&gt;“We have been working on prevention of cytokine storm for nearly three years. Lenzilumab has an excellent safety and tolerability profile and has not been associated with serious adverse events, including in patients who are immunosuppressed or with severe asthma.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Humanigen has pioneered the field of GM-CSF neutralization and, unlike others, has already conducted two Phase I and two Phase II studies, including in patients with severe respiratory conditions, with excellent safety results.”

And so, a Phase III protocol for evaluating the efficacy of Lenzilumab in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was [submitted to the FDA](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-03-27/humanigen-submits-phase-iii-protocol-synopsis-to-fda-for-lenzilumab-for-coronavirus-treatment). 

That was over a year ago, back in March 2020.

The [study](https://www.stopstorm.com/) formally started on May 5, 2020.

**IND authorization.**

In April 2020 (just one month after starting the Phase III protocol), Lenzilumab was granted emergency single use Investigational New Drug Application (IND) authorization from the FDA (known as compassionate use) to treat patients with COVID-19.

**What is compassionate use?**

It is a potential pathway for a patient with an [immediately life-threatening condition or serious disease or condition](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/expanded-access/expanded-access-keywords-definitions-and-resources) to gain access to an [investigational medical product](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/expanded-access/expanded-access-keywords-definitions-and-resources) for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available.

In other words, when faced with the grim outcome of their current COVID-19 advanced infection, some patients opted for the last Hail Mary attempt—Lenzilumab.

**Mayo Clinic realizes they have something unique.**

Humanigen did not seek, screen, or pre-select any patients who opted for the compassionate use. Mayo Clinic requested the FDA, on behalf of each individual patient, before each dosing of Lenzilumab.

It was not a formal study. It was compassionate use—it was a Hail Mary pass.

But the positive results were overwhelming.

The compassionate use patients who received Lenzilumab were already hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen but were not on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) yet. However, all patients had elevation in at least one inflammatory biomarker, and all patients had at least one co-morbidity associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Several of them had multiple co-morbidities. Also, they were viewed as being at high risk of further disease progression (hence the compassionate use).

So Mayo Clinic started to match those compassionate use patients with their own electronic registry of other COVID-19 patients in the same centers. Matching the cases for age, sex, disease severity, and baseline oxygen requirements.

Basically, they wanted to find other patients who faced similar conditions as the compassionate use patients and then compare the outcomes between them.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mayo Clinic noticed Lenzilumab was helping COVID-19 patients with expected poor outcomes.](https://i.redd.it/qlomvdkufwj71.gif)

**Mayo Clinic reports the results.**

On September 1, 2020, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, a premier peer-reviewed journal, published the first case-control data of Lenzilumab in COVID-19 patients.

It demonstrated an 80% reduction in relative risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or death for patients treated with Lenzilumab compared to the matched control group.

Yes, [80% reduction](https://www.humanigen.com/lenzilumab).

If you follow that link, scroll down to see the tables with demographics and baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and laboratory markers.

**Operation Warp Speed.**

On November 6, 2020, Humanigen was [handpicked](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201106005073/en/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-Department-of-Defense-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19) for the OWS (Operation Warp Speed) in the fight against COVID-19.

HGEN and the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND or JPEO) entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), in support of Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to [gain access to manufacturing capacity](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1293310/000121465921000716/ex99_1.htm) reserved by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The agreement supports development of Lenzilumab in advance of a potential Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19.

The amended CRADA, now co-signed by BARDA, **provides Humanigen with access to manufacturing capacity** reserved by BARDA for fill-finish product to accelerate the drug product manufacturing of Lenzilumab. The initial agreement, originally signed in November 2020, complements Humanigen’s development efforts for Lenzilumab by **providing access to a full-scale, integrated team of manufacturing and regulatory subject matter experts and statistical support** in anticipation of applying for EUA and subsequently a Biologics License Application (BLA) for Lenzilumab as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

So they’ve been preparing and getting ready for mass production. Like a race car—engine running, hands on the wheel, and eyes straight ahead—just waiting for the green light of the FDA EUA.

&amp;#x200B;

[Realizing Lenzilumab’s potential, a Phase 3 study was already underway.](https://i.redd.it/2p46ud24gwj71.gif)

**Phase III results are already in!**

Remember I mentioned that they submitted the Phase III protocol back in March 2020? The Phase III study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Lenzilumab in patients with COVID-19?

Well, here’s the study: [NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152).

It’s already completed!

You can read more about it in this [PubMed article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33972949/).

But here is the conclusion, and I quote:

&gt;Conclusion: Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV (survival without ventilation) in hospitalized, hypoxic subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia over and above treatment with remdesivir and/or corticosteroids. Subjects with CRP&lt;150 mg/L and age &lt;85 years demonstrated an improvement in survival and had the greatest benefit from Lenzilumab.

So there’s no doubt about it—Lenzilumab works.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lenzilumab significantly improves survival without ventilation in COVID-19 patients.](https://i.redd.it/1dkwc55bgwj71.gif)

**Finally, the time came for the EUA submission.**

Because after the Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial in the setting of COVID-19 results came in, Humanigen had everything they needed for the filing of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission.

And they did just that, on May 28, 2021.

[Humanigen Submits Application to FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for Lenzilumab in COVID-19](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210528005244/en/Humanigen-Submits-Application-to-FDA-for-Emergency-Use-Authorization-for-Lenzilumab-in-COVID-19).

**That’s the earliest and most important catalyst.**

There are no guarantees, but it looks like it’s only a matter of time before they receive the EUA.

**Why do you think that?**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Phase III already supports the efficacy of Lenzilumab.  
 
2. The Delta variant, and potential new variants in the future, will still create spikes in COVID-19 hospitalization.  
 
3. Let’s face it. A lot of people will not get vaccinated. Many of them will do just fine, even if they get infected. But an increasingly significant number will end up in the hospital with an expected grim outcome. And once someone reaches the hospital, it’s already too late to get a vaccine.  
 
4. Lenzilumab can prevent and treat the immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, [a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1293310/000121465921000716/ex99_1.htm). Data showed that up to 89 percent of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at risk of this immune hyper-response, which is believed to trigger the acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases of COVID-19.  
 
5. Lenzilumab can make the difference between going on a ventilator (which reduces one’s chance of survival) and leaving the hospital alive. Thus the need for the FDA to fast-track a treatment that can save lives now.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

[The next step is the FDA EUA. FDA EUA = 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.redd.it/k14jngbkgwj71.gif)

**When will that happen?**

Again, there are no guarantees or scheduled dates.

However, I did some [research](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/coronavirus-covid-19-drugs/cder-scientific-review-documents-supporting-emergency-use-authorizations-drug-and-biological) and found out the number of days that elapsed between the submission receipt date (when the FDA received the EUA submission) and the action date (when the FDA approved the EUA) for other COVID-19-related drug and biological therapeutic products (not vaccines).

Bamlanivimab took 34 days.

Baricitinib in combination with Remdesivir took 35 days.

Propofol-Lipuro 1% took 39 days.

REGEN-COV took 44 days.

Sotrovimab took 63 days.

Actemra took 65 days.

Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab took 85 days.

We know Humanigen submitted Lenzilumab's application on May 28, 2021.

As of today—Aug 27, 2021—it's been 91 days.

**Why is it taking so long?**

Well, the FDA allocated its resources to prioritize the review and eventual approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

On July 30, the [FDA spokesperson](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/fda-puts-all-hands-on-deck-to-review-pfizer-biontech-covid-shot), Abby Capobianco said the FDA was:

&gt;""identifying additional resources such as personnel and technological resources from across the agency and opportunities to reprioritize other activities, in order to complete our review to help combat this pandemic surge.""

While acting [Director Janet Woodcock](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/fda-puts-all-hands-on-deck-to-review-pfizer-biontech-covid-shot) said she had:

&gt;""offered all agency resources to the team to make this happen.""

That work is done. So I'm hoping the team will now focus on Lenzilumab.

Take it with a grain of salt, but many believe that if there were an issue with the EUA, the FDA would've already told HGEN about it. If the FDA hasn't found any problems, it's good news, even if it takes longer.

It might happen until late September, but this rocket is ready to go to the Moon.

Think of it as an actual space rocket launch. It might get postponed a little longer because of the weather, but it's happening—and it's happening soon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Wen Moon? 🌝 Soon. Very soon. 🚀](https://i.redd.it/fvpa8wtmhwj71.gif)

**Consider this is a shares play, not an options one.**

You do you, but my research has routinely found the IV is too high, so you should stick to shares on this one. It is a much safer option.

Personally, I have 481 shares at an average cost of $15.70.

I know that quantity will sound insignificant to some, and I agree. But as someone on the autism spectrum (thank you for making me embrace the concept of being a True Autist!) and a seizure-alert Service Dog, it’s tough for me to keep a job, and this is what I can currently afford.

**So should I buy and hodl?**

I can’t tell you that. It’s your decision.

But I can tell you that, even though the upcoming FDA EUA announcement is the next catalyst, there’s also the MHRA CMA.

**What’s the MHRA CMA?**

On June 15, 2021, Humanigen also [applied for a marketing approval](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/humanigen-rolling-submission-drug/) from UK’s MHRA (the equivalent for the FDA). They intend to be recognized with a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application (CMA).

Just like COVID-19 is a global issue, Lenzilumab will be required all around the world.

**And there are more catalysts.**

Although it’s a COVID-19 play now, Lenzilumab was initially meant to treat certain types of leukemia.

On April 21, 2021, Humanigen [appointed](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-appoints-dr-adrian-kilcoyne-to-the-role-of-chief-medical-officer/) Dr. Adrian Kilcoyne, MD, MBA, MPH, to the newly-created role of Chief Medical Officer. He was AstraZeneca’s VP of Oncology Global Medical Affairs, Head of Evidence Generation and External Alliances.

Humanigen already has an [ongoing study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04314843) of Lenzilumab and Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in participants with relapsed or refractory large b-cell lymphoma. Which is sponsored by Kite, a [Gilead](https://www.gilead.com/) company.

Take it with a grain of salt, but dig deeper into Humanigen, and you’ll find rumors about a potential buyout. Not so much for the COVID-19 play, but for the cancer treatments down the road.

According to [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HGEN/research-ratings), eight out of eight analysts have HGEN as a buy.

Ok, now it's time for me to take my dog for a walk.

Have a wonderful day.

# Phunware, Inc. (NASDAQ: PHUN) (the “Company”), a fully-integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile known as Multiscreen-as-a-Service (“MaaS”) that provides products, solutions, data, and services for brands worldwide, announced the launch of PhunCoin, a security token that seeks to empower consumers to take control of and be compensated fairly for their data.

# PhunCoin is an innovative cryptocurrency uniquely positioned for mainstream adoption because it is leveraging the global reach and distribution of a NASDAQ-listed company that specializes in consumer engagement and monetization. Founded in 2009, Phunware has developed mobile ecosystems for some of the world’s most recognizable brands. Phunware has also generated over 15 billion Phunware IDs tied to consumers all over the world and developed a customer data platform (“CDP”) that manages approximately one billion monthly active devices when operating at scale.

# “Data is arguably the most valuable asset on the planet, but consumers continue to be exploited for this vital resource without consideration or permission by large data oligarchs,” said Alan S. Knitowski, President, CEO, and Co-Founder of Phunware. “We launched PhunCoin to usher in a new era of transparency and accountability that enables consumers to determine not only what data they share and who they share it with, but also what that data is worth.”

&amp;#x200B;

# Current situation:

**Financials:**

Tesla reported second-quarter 2021 earnings of $1.45, which surpassed the analyst consensus of 90 cents per share. Higher-than-expected automotive gross profit resulted in outperformance. Precisely, automotive gross profit came in at $2,899 million, topping the consensus mark of $2,504 million. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago earnings of 44 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $11,958 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $11,389 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 98.1%.

Importantly, the firm generated a free cash flow of $619 million during the quarter. This last point is essential as it means that Tesla can generate cash by itself. It implies that in the future they won’t be capital raise anymore which dilutes shareholder capital.

**Car production:**

Delivery and production totaled 201,304 and 206,421 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 121% and 151%, respectively. Tesla reported stellar second-quarter 2021 production and deliveries despite global chip shortage, thanks to the increasing popularity of green vehicles, preference for personal mobility, easier credit conditions, and economic recovery buoyed by accelerated vaccination drive as well as massive fiscal stimulus.

Model 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 206,421 and 199,409 vehicles, reflecting whopping year-over-year growth of 169% and 148%, respectively. Meanwhile, production and delivery of Model S/X fell 63% and 82% on a year-over-year basis to 2,340 and 1,895 units, respectively. Even if this was anticipable, it is bad news as margins on the Model 3 and Model Y are way smaller than onthe Model S or X. 

Total automotive revenues surged 97% year over year to $10,206 million for the reported quarter. This included $354 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which decreased 17% year over year. Even with this decrease, Tesla did well this quarter. It contradicts the thesis of short-sellers who pretend that Tesla is highly dependant on the sale of regulatory credits for making money. Automotive gross margin was 28.4%, improving 298 basis points from second-quarter 2020. This is key as margins are what finally determine how profitable a company is. 

**Energy and storage**

Energy generation and storage revenues came in at $801 million for second-quarter 2021 compared with $370 million in the year-ago period. Services and other revenues were up 95.2% years over year to $951 million. These digits show that Musk is now able to use the knowledge developed for car batteries to produce home batteries used for saving electricity. Moreover, the current trend in the decentralization of electricity production will lead to increasing demand for such batteries in order to save electricity generated at home, through solar panels, or other sources. By also having solar panels, through the acquisition of Solar City in 2016, Tesla owns the whole life cycle of electricity. All in all, it means that Tesla is getting closer to its target to be an ecosystem where customers produce their own electricity, save it overnight through batteries, and then charge their Tesla with their own electricity.

# Catalysts:

**Production target:**

While Tesla has not provided any clear delivery target for 2021, it reiterated its goal of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Looking at the current results (+ 121% YoY), this target seems to be easily achievable and may even be overshot which would give a further push to the stock. 

Moreover, even if Musk said that the production of the Cybertruck will be delayed, it seems not to scare investors. Baird, an analyst for Ben Kallo, said in a note to clients:  ""Despite minor shifts in the timeline, we expect the introduction of Semi and Cybertruck to be positive catalysts for Tesla stock in the intermediate-term.""

**Risen estimates**

In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review. The consensus estimate has shifted 8.09% due to these changes. This is key. It means that investors were surprised by the results of Tesla and become more ambitious about its future. Even if Musk promises a lot, analysts are still surprised and raise their target price.

# Dangers:

**Increasing competition:**

Even if Tesla had astonishing results, rivals, and especially Chinese companies like Nio, Xpeng and Li are also doing well.

**False advertising:**

The US government has started to investigate a problem that seems essential: Musk repeatedly oversells the current and near-term potential for his automotive autonomy advanced technology. For years he has said that Teslas would soon be autonomous and he has called the driving software ""Autopilot"" even if Teslas are far from being autonomous.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

Last earnings show that Tesla is still able to impress analysts despite high expectations. Growth in deliveries was massive, profits and revenues jumped. Even if some analysts doubt the capacity of Musk to reach his objectives and others are afraid of lawsuits again Tesla due to false advertising, Tesla seems on the right track to reach its long-term goal, i.e. to become a company giving the customers full freedom over their production and consumption of electricity and let them freely move with their electrical cars.

**What is Korsuva?**

Korsuva is a drug group of CARA and refers to the reduction of itching. This offers two benefits. First, potential treatment modalities for symptom reduction are easier to create than a basic cause cure. Second, from a commercial perspective, recurring sales of such products are much more profitable.

There are four disease types, of which 5 different versions of Korsuva are currently being tested in the pipeline.

1. The treatment of pruritus in combination with chronic kidney disease (CKD-aP) in adults undergoing hemodialysis, or ""IV Korsuva,"" was approved this week. The results from the approved product in terms of safety and efficacy were impressive. It took over ten years of development.
2. The main product in this pipeline ""Oral Korsuva: Atopic Dermatitis (AD)"" was responsible for the share price plunge in April 2021. However, the readouts were misinterpreted and may not be a complete write off. The study missed targets in moderate-to-severe pruritus, but met all targets in patients with mild-to-moderate AD (accounted for 64% of participants). Phase III will also be initiated for this group in Q3 2021. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic, pruritic, inflammatory dermatosis, affecting up to 12% of children and 5% to 7% of adults, and patients with mild to moderate AD also make up a significantly larger target group.
3. There are no adverse events in any of the other studies in the pipeline. The approval this week is also a positive sign for all other pipeline studies, as the products do not differ in their basic structure, except that the others are oral treatments. Importantly, all of the rest of the pipeline is in Phase II. These are not high-risk, low-probability trials, but have been well proven.

&amp;#x200B;

**FDA approval for intervenous injection of ""IV Korsuva"" is not a niche product**

Worldwide, 3.7 million patients regularly undergo dialysis treatments. These treatments are vital. Kidney disease is one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States. Nearly 40 million people in the U.S. are affected by chronic kidney disease. Of these, 500,000 patients require dialysis. 40% percent of dialysis patients are affected by symptoms, which ""IV Korsuva"" treats. In the USA alone, 200 000 people are potential customers immediately. It is precisely for this potential market that ""IV Korsuva"" has just been approved as the first (!) treatment method. According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 30 million patients live with chronic kidney disease. It is estimated that almost 50% of patients suffer from some form of itch Even if the oral version of Korsuva has not yet been approved, the market is already huge in USA only.

&amp;#x200B;

**Production &amp; sales with Q1 2022 launch is a no-brainer**

""IV Korsuva"" is the first approved treatment in this field. One has the advantage of first mover and will dominate the market. First of all, manufacturing is a fast process because the chemical structure is very simple. By partnering with Vifor, one has a gigantic advantage. Vifor has a joint venture with Fresenius Medical Care (FMC). FMC specializes in kidney disease. 345,646 patients in a worldwide network of 4,000 dialysis clinics receive treatment at FMC. 1/3 of the dialysis centers in the U.S. are attributable to FMC. Here, profits are shared 50/50. In non-FMC dialysis centers, which account for two-thirds, Vifor also handles distribution and profits are split 60/40. Whether dialysis will increasingly be performed at home in the future is not relevant, as these are also managed by FMC.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shareholder structure - ""Smart Money""**

75% of the market capitalization is held by insiders or institutions. Partner Vifor holds almost 15% of the shares. Part is known to have been acquired in 2018 for $17/share. According to the terms of the agreement, Vifor is entitled to common shares in the amount of $50 million at a 20% premium to the 30-day price after approval of ""IV Korsuva"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Profits only (!) with ""IV Korsuva""**

There are two types of agreements.

1. 2018: Vifor is allowed to distribute ""IV Korsuva"" worldwide except USA, Japan and South Korea. For this, CARA has received $50 million in cash and the as before mentioned $20 million acquisition for $17/share. In addition, CARA is entitled to payments of $470 million, of which $440 million is revenue-based. CARA is also entitled to tiered royalties based on net sales of KORSUVA injections in the licensed territories.
2. 2020 Update-U.S.: CARA will receive up to USD 240 million upon achievement of certain sales-based milestones. In addition, Vifor has paid USD 100 million upfront. If Vifor wants to pay USD 240m in the coming years for about 43% (1/3 \* 50% FMC + 2/3 \* 40% non-FMC) of profits and has already paid USD 100m upfront, then Vifor/FMC must be sure that more than this bonus plus upfront payment can be generated in profits, otherwise the deal would be meaningless. 57% of the profits remain with CARA. It may be assumed that Vifor has done its homework and a conservative calculation, in which Vifor breakeven exits, results in the following profits for CARA. If 340 million payments from Vifor is to be worth at least 43% of profits, then CARA's 57% profit share must be worth approximately $450 million. Thus, one can consistently assume sales in the billions in the coming years, of which at least USD 790 million (340 + 450) will be retained by CARA. Vifor/FMC knows its patients in the clinics and knows exactly what potential lies dormant here. Vifor will not enter into a breakeven deal but expect much higher profits. These are just conservative estimates. Again, I would like to explicitly point out that the use of ""Korsuva IV"" does not reduce the number of patients, but only alleviates their symptoms. This is an essential difference to a cure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future price drivers**

1. Medicare and Medicaid approvals will come in the next few weeks.
2. In Q3 2021, Phase III will be initiated for the successful ""Oral Korsuva: Atopic Dermatitis (AD)"" portion. FDA will not raise any issues here as it is only Phase III and not a commitment. Thus, the April 2021 price slide is partially moot.
3. EMA approval for ""IV Korsuva"" is expected in the first/second quarter of 2022.
4. One may wait for an extension of the partnership with Vifor/FMC for Europe or updates which have not been communicated yet. The difference of announced payments from 2018 and 2020 show that CARA will get even more money from Vifor/FMC in the future.
5. The launch of the distribution and regular quarterly results with continuously growing sales are unusual and very rare for biotechs. This news will fuel the share price.
6. Future readouts of oral versions of Korsuva offer far more opportunities than risks. CARA was sold off after the last readout in April 2021. The negative results are priced into the share price. Any potential positive readout of one of the 4 oral versions of Korsuva would cause the share price to explode.
7. Vifor will acquire the agreed block of shares (due to the successful FDA approval) in the amount of USD 50 million. Given the immense total investment, a buy-out is very likely.
8. 7.5 percent of the shares are sold short. Hedge funds have speculated on a rejection by the FDA and will liquidate their positions in the coming days or weeks. A small short-squeeze is also possible.
9. CARA has now announced that the approval will fund the entire pipeline through 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

CARA is now no longer a speculative stock, but with the approval of ""IV Korsuva"" a value company with the prospect that the pipeline can explode the value. You get CARA at the price before the important FDA decision with the value of the FDA approval. Only with approval of ""IV Korsuva"" in the US is CARA worth at least $30-45/share. Oral approval would give final access to the mass market. Here we are not talking about 100 or 200 percent upside potential, but a tenbagger.

**Overview**

Medifast is a weight-loss company similar to Weight Watchers, but much more profitable and with better management. The company is an MLM that uses coaches (aka Facebook moms) to sell weight-loss plans. This means they market and ship directly to the customer at retail prices, so margins aren't compressed by third-party distributors/wholesalers. About 90% of coaches started as clients, which is a crazy statistic.  They have about 60,000 coaches and each brings in about $3,500 a quarter. Check out the Yahoo Finance conversations page to see how much people really love this company.

**Fundamentals** 

Medifast is currently trading at around 2x sales with a PE of around 17. They consistently offer conservative guidance (the main reason for the stock being down 30% from its 52 week high is that they warned the cost of their raw materials may increase due to inflation) but they significantly beat earnings more often than not. Just look at their performance over the last 10 years. My favorite part about this company is that their ROIC, ROA, and ROE have been growing consistently since 2011.  They also pay out a dividend of close to 3% and have grown net profit margins from 12.7% to 15.5% of revenue since the beginning of the year.  The potential upside is 77% according to Yahoo Finance.

**The Play** 

Medifast currently has just under 12M shares outstanding, which means that the stock can move insanely fast with even a small amount of volume. We saw an almost 50% gain in May and we're currently about 33% below the 52 week high.  I don't see the stock going more than 5% below where it currently is given they crushed earnings last quarter and they're repurchasing shares.  The only thing this stock needs to run is volume. A quick reversal here is inevitable even without WSB attention, so get in while you can.

**Rocket Lab (RKLB)** is the newest addition to the NASDAQ as of August 25, 2021. It is an aerospace manufacturer and satellite launch service provider. It developed a sub-orbital sounding rocket named [Ātea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atea) and currently operates a lightweight orbital rocket called [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(rocket)). It is developing a new medium-lift launch vehicle named Neutron.

The company was founded in New Zealand in 2006 by engineer [Peter Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Beck), a less eccentric CEO of another company we all know and talk about here. RKLB has its headquarters in California in the United States since 2013.

**UPCOMING MISSIONS**

This company is, without exaggeration, going to the moon.

Scheduled to lift-off in late August, the [‘Love At First Insight’](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/next-mission/) mission will be the fifth mission of 2021. While this flight is planned to deploy the more satellites into a planned constellation (with more coming), RKLB is planning on supporting operations for NASA’s Artemis program which will land the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024.

Using their Electron rocket and Photon Lunar spacecraft, RKLB will launch NASA’s CAPSTONE satellite into lunar orbit. 

**PATENTS IN AEROSPACE**

In 2012, Rocket Lab demonstrated a rocket propelled by a Viscous Liquid Monopropellant (VLM) developed in work sponsored by [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA) and the [Office of Naval Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Research) (NRL). This new fancy shit behaves like that goopy crap you made in primary school (for those of you who went). It acts as a pseudo solid until force is applied, then it acts like a liquid.

This VLM fuel requires no special handling, is non-toxic, water soluble, has a low sensitivity to shock, a high ignition point, and was barely flammable in atmosphere. RocketLab has been issued a [US patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_patent_law) US20120234196A1 on a Viscous Liquid Monopropellant. **They are the only company that can make or use this fuel**

DDR 5 memory is coming soon. Shipping costs are going down. Crsr is paying off their debt. Revenues are growing every year and profits hitting records. Stock price has tumbled recently making this a good value/growth play. We all know the streaming industry and gaming industry is only going to continue to grow. Short percentage is the highest it’s ever been. I got in before wallstreet notices this stock. Some DD below.

In terms of revenue, Corsair Gaming saw a 24.3% growth to $472.9 million dollars with most of it coming from their gamer and creator peripherals sector. That revenue increased by a whopping 41% to $155.2 million dollars, while the gaming components and systems segment only increased by 17.6% to $317.7 million dollars. One reason behind that was the shortage of semiconductors which everyone knows about. However, more importantly for Corsair Gaming, there was a big shortage of high-end CPUs and graphics cards which really affected their ability to sell high-end gaming PCs. Corsair Gaming's CFO shared that they have a lot of customers waiting for these components to become available so we could see a bump in sales during the next quarter. Other flagship products were also affected and were out of stock for a long time. Keyboards. High-end headsets. Obviously, that also resulted in lower sales. Plus, historically, the second quarter of the year tends to be the weakest for Corsair Gaming in terms of revenue with the fourth typically being the strongest. You know, Black Friday, Christmas, it's a good quarter for a lot of hardware companies! Plus, Corsair Gaming maintain their focus on increasing their product range which will also continue to boost revenue.
Breaking down profits / earnings

Looking at profits, Corsair Gaming's gross margin remained flat at 27.6%. However, even though their gross profit increased by 24% as compared to last year, their operating profit dropped. One look at their financial statements tells us that their sales, general and admin expenses went up by a lot and essentially offset the jump in their profit. It looks like a big chunk, about $4.5 million dollars or 5%, was stock-based compensation, which is most likely the result of the jump in their share price or their revenue. A lot of companies have these stock incentives where they reward staff for good performance or their executives or CEOs for the jump in price. The good thing is that stock incentives are not actually cash expenses even though they are recorded on the income statement. Essentially, Corsair Gaming doesn't spend any cash on these. High stock incentives are typical for companies with recent IPOs or growing companies in general. When we compare Corsair Gaming's operating expenses to the same quarter last year, these increased by 41%. The main reasons behind that according to Corsair Gaming's CFO, Michael Potter, was increased shipping costs, more expenses due to Corsair Gaming now being a public company and also an increase in personnel costs due to growing their number of products. He expects that operating expenses will continue to rise as the company grows, but that should be offset by improving the gross margins. In terms of net earnings, their target net margins are in the low- to mid-teens so essentially between 10 and 15%. Currently, they are much lower. This quarter, the second quarter of 2021, their net margin is only 5.8%. Corsair Gaming's GAAP EPS was $0.28 dollars for the second quarter of 2021 and their non-GAAP EPS was $0.36. Corsair Gaming's net earnings were $27.7 million dollars, up from $22.6 million last year so a 22% increase! Their adjusted net earnings were $35.7 million, up from $32.3 million over the same period last year so again a 10.5% increase which is lower, but it's still good. Overall, net earnings are rising fast, but we can expect to see a lot of improvement over the next few quarters. One of the drivers behind higher margins is the increased demand for peripherals that we saw. As a segment, they are higher margin than the gaming components and systems segment with a gross margin of 35.2% vs 23.8% as of the second quarter of 2021. Growing the peripherals segment should result in better overall margins so it's good to see that there is increased demand.
Paying down debt

Before I move on to the outlook, I want to say that Corsair Gaming also managed to pay down some debt. Looking at the financial statements, we can see that their interest expense was only half of what it was last year! $4.5 million dollars in Q2 of 2021 vs $9.6 million dollars in Q2 of 2020! Corsair Gaming said that they're continuing to pay down the debt and expect only $4 million dollars worth of interest expenses for the coming quarters. Personally, I like the fact that they are keeping their finances under control. One of the main reason why fast-growing companies fail is due to aggressive overexpansion while having poor financial health. That's not going to happen with Corsair Gaming, which is really good to see.
2021 Guidance

Alright, so, the outlook! Corsair Gaming have said that their guidance for 2021 remains unchanged. They expect between $1.9 and $2.1 billion in revenue, adjusted operating income of $235 and $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $245 and $265 million. In 2020, Corsair Gaming's revenue was only $1.7 billion so that would show an increase of between 12% and 23.5% in revenue. Corsair Gaming's adjusted EBITDA was $213 million in 2020 so their guidance shows a possible increase of between 15% and 24.5%, which is great to see! Personally, I also want to see this reflected in their net income, but as I said, I think stock compensation and a couple of other factors can affect this. In terms of things to watch, it looks like the semiconductor shortage and shipping costs are at the top of the list. The sooner these issues go away, the sooner Corsair Gaming will see a jump in net income.",wallstreetbets,CRSR going to the moon soon?

Most option strategies involve trading volatility in one way or another. It’s easy to think of trading in terms of direction. But trading volatility? Volatility is an abstract concept; it has often nothing to do with the stock price. I've seen many of you ask questions of the sort: 

Stock go up after earnings but call go down, hedgies bad. Or,

Stock go up, but put go up as well, I need to exploit this glitch.

I will try to shed some light on some of these topics. The first step to understand when buying options is that you profit from volatility going up.

Yes, you heard me correctly, you might not know it but when you buy FDs such as GME 1000C you are effectively long vega or long volatility. Yeah that's sounds fancy, I'm sure you'll impress your grandma with that at Christmas. She might even lend you some money so you can ""invest it"". 

Many traders trade without a solid understanding of volatility and its effect on option prices. These traders are often unhappily surprised when volatility moves against them. They mistake the adverse option price movements that result from volatility for getting ripped off by the market makers or some other market voodoo. 

The term volatility can have a few different meanings in the options business. There are three different uses of the word volatility that an option trader must be concerned with: historical volatility, implied volatility, and expected volatility. Let's dive in!

 

**Implied volatility** is the expected magnitude of a stock's future price changes, as *implied* by the stock's option prices. Implied volatility is represented as an annualized percentage. It's important to note that IV is extracted from the options price and is thus determined by supply and demiand

Consider the following stocks and their respective option prices (options with 37 days to expiration):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q3rfkxs5eij71.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=052b34e0d2090bc84452e4241b890494ac540771

As we can see, both stocks are nearly the same price. However, the same options on each stock have different prices. In the case of TCOM, the call and put prices are much higher than ELY's options, which translates to an implied volatility that is higher than ELY So, instead of looking at option prices all day long, options traders use implied volatility to quickly compare the expected price movements (and therefore, the option prices) of various stocks. In this case, there's only a 10 percentage point difference between the two, yet the differences are huge.

**Why is this the case**

When market participants trade options, they typically do it for one of two reasons:

**1)** To speculate on movements in the stock price or the stock's option prices (implied volatility).

**2)** To hedge the risk of an existing position against changes in the stock price.

If market participants are willing to pay a high price for options, then that *implies* they are expecting significant movements in the stock price or implied volatility. 

Conversely, if market participants aren't willing to pay much for options, then that implies the market is not expecting significant stock price movements.

Since implied volatility represents the overall level of a stock's option prices, **implied volatility is just a way to describe the market's expectations for future stock price movements**. The higher the implied volatility, the larger the expected range of moves. This is why IV increases before earnings and crashes after.

Alright, this is the basics, now let's see some other concepts and dig deeper into IV.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical Volatility** 

Imagine there are two stocks: Stock A and Stock B. Both are trading at around $100 a share. Over the past month, a typical end-of-day net change in the price of Stock A has been up or down $5 to $7. During that same period, a typical daily move in Stock B has been something more like up or down $1 or $2. Stock A has tended to move more than Stock B as a percentage of its price, without regard to direction. 

Therefore, Stock A is more volatile than Stock B. Thus, Stock A has a higher historical volatility than Stock B. Historical volatility (HV) is the annualized standard deviation of daily returns. Also called realized volatility, statistical volatility, or stock volatility.

HV is a measure of how volatile the price movement of a security has been during a certain period of time. But exactly how much higher is Stock A’s HV than Stock B’s? In order to objectively compare the volatilities of two stocks, historical volatility must be quantified. HV relates this volatility information in an objective numerical form. The volatility of a stock is expressed in terms of standard deviation. 

**Standard Deviation** 

Although knowing the mathematical formula behind standard deviation is not entirely necessary, understanding the concept is essential. Standard deviation, sometimes represented by the Greek letter sigma, is a mathematical calculation that measures the dispersion of data from a mean value. In this case, the mean is the average stock price over a certain period of time. The farther from the mean the dispersion of occurrences (data) was during the period, the greater the standard deviation. Occurrences, in this context, are usually the closing prices of the stock. For the purpose of illustrating standard deviation, a normal distribution is used here. When the graph of data adheres to a normal distribution, the result is a symmetrical bell-shaped curve. Standard deviation can be shown on the bell curve to either side of the mean. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cfmxuy3u0hj71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a760961ee1dc11aef8599c2fe5b0a5259c3261c

&amp;#x200B;

On the right vertical axis, you can see the number of occurences, on the horinzontal axis, you can see the daily return. The higher the curve, the more likely we are to see that return. For example, for stocks you are most likley to see returns around 0. This is why the curve is highest around 0.

Events that cause big changes in the price of a stock, like a company’s being acquired by another or discovering its chief financial officer cooking the books, are not a daily occurrence. Comparatively smaller price fluctuations that reflect less extreme changes in the value of the corporation are more typically seen day to day. Statistically, the most probable outcome for a price change is found around the midpoint of the curve. 

About 68 percent of all occurrences will take place between up one standard deviation and down one standard deviation. Two- and three-standard-deviation values could be shown on the curve as well. About 95 percent of data occur between up and down two standard deviations and about 99.7 percent between up and down three standard deviations. One standard deviation is the relevant figure in determining historical volatility. 

**Standard Deviation and Historical Volatility**

 When standard deviation is used in the context of historical volatility, it is annualized to state what the one-year volatility would be. Historical volatility is the annualized standard deviation of daily returns. This means that if a stock is trading at $100 a share and its historical volatility is 10 percent, then about 68 percent of the occurrences (closing prices) are expected to fall between $90 and $110 during a one-year period (based on recent past performance). Simply put, historical volatility shows how volatile a stock has been based on price movements that have occurred in the past. Although option traders may study HV to make informed decisions as to the value of options traded on a stock, it is not a direct function of option prices. For this, we must look to implied volatility.

**IV rank and IV percentile**

Even though most of you degenerates first think about philosophy when you hear about the greeks, it's highly likely you've already heard of Implied Volatility Rank (IV Rank).  

If you've got one or two brain wrinkles you might even have heard about IV Percentile. We're going to highlight the difference between the two, which may help you lose less money in the future, or at least do it professionally

IV Rank is one of the more popular volatility trading metrics, and is relatively easy to understand.  IV Rank tells us whether implied volatility is high or low in a specific underlying relative to the past year of implied volatility data.

For example, imagine that implied volatility has ranged between 30 and 60 for underlying XYZ over the past year. If implied volatility is currently trading at 45, then the IV Rank for XYZ would be 50% - exactly in the middle of its one-year historical range.

If implied volatility was 60 in XYZ, then its IV Rank would be 100%. It literally is that simple:

IV of stock is low during the year, IV is high now -&gt; IV Rank will be high.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's take a look at Implied Volatility Percentile (IV Percentile).

Notably, IV Percentile doesn't specifically take into account the high and low in implied volatility over the past year.

Instead, IV Percentile represents the percentage of days that implied volatility has traded below the current level over the past year. For example, if IV Percentile is 5% in XYZ, that would mean that implied volatility only traded below current levels 5% of the time over the course of the previous 12 months.

On the other hand, if IV Percentile in XYZ is 80%, that would mean that implied volatility had traded below current levels 80% of the time over the previous 12 months.

The slide below, also from Trading with Katie, depicts graphically another example where IV Percentile is 21%. That means that 79% of the time, implied volatility was higher than current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interest I could go deeper and try to cover implied ranges or how to calulate what moves are expected in a stock given an IV. Send me a message, and I'll see what I can do.

In the mean time, please don't YOLO your mom's savings in some degenerate FD just because, ""I'm so cool, I'm long Vega"". I have little hope, but do send me a picture of your lambo when you make bank.

**TLDR: Volatility is important and easy to understand, go read. Big tendies await you**

$DKNG recently launched an NFT marketplace. For the apes who don’t know NFTs, NFTs are good, have high demand, and make the marketplace a lot of money. $DKNG makes 5% of every NFT transaction.

So how much will $DKNG make with their NFT marketplace. A competitor, NBA top shot, has an estimated $3 billion in transactions per year. Can we even call Top Shot a competitor? $DKNG is positioned to squash them with a much larger user base. For comparison, $DKNG has about 8 million users while Top Shot has about 1.5 million users, a 5 time multiple. It’s reasonable to say that $DKNG marketplace will be doing 5x the transactions as top shot in the near term.  For the dumbest of apes, that’s $15 billion in transactions per year.

Okay, that’s a lot of money but how much does $DKNG make from this. It doesn’t take an Ape to figure this out, 5% of $15 billion = $750 million. An NFT marketplace has very little overhead and that $750 million is almost pure profit. 

This will increase revenue by 60% and increase earnings by infinite%. Not to mention turn the table of $DKNG losing money to making a boatload. Oh, did I mention that the NFT marketplace will bring new users to the app where they will spend money elsewhere? One more thing - THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE.

This is some real DD that the suits are too smart to understand. It takes a real thick skilled ape to understand how rich $DKNG is about to make you.",wallstreetbets,$DKNG to the Moon,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pbbuoy/dkng_to_the_moon/

As part of governments ˝made in America˝ program Intel will invest in new factories in Arizona and expand existing capacity. 

On Taiwan they screwed over Apple and AMD and booked most of TSMC's 3nm capacity for the next year.

In Q1 2022 they will also release their new gpus. Rumors say that Intel's top of the range gpu is on par with Nvidia's 3070.

Income Statement.
Revenues are growing 140% year-over-year.
Instead of slowing down, revenues are picking up. I personally anticipated 45-50% revenue growth, but as you can see, they have far surpassed that target.
 
Balance Sheet.
Company is extremely safe in terms of the current ratio and other liabilities. Can sustain almost any economic storm thrown at it. Even if they are pressed to issue more shares, I think investors are willing to accept that because there’s massive growth potential (top and bottom line).
 
Cash Flows.
Not only will Clover Health be cash flow positive as early as next year, but it will also probably be GAAP profitable within 12-24 months from now, especially as vaccination rates pick up and costs come down.
 
Brand.
Company has a growing brand that is growing by the week. Leadership and investors have a great vision and purpose for the company. Clover Assistant will be getting more and more exposure, as well.
 
Insider Ownership.
About 75% of outstanding shares are held by management team and early investors. The remaining amount is held by retail and institutions.
 
Additional Information.
Short squeeze aside (which is very real and very possible), this is a great company with a wonderful vision and future, in my opinion.
 
Bullish Technicals on $CLOV:
 
Chart.
The chart looks exactly how it should for a value investor. Of course, value investors look for beat-up assets that can be purchased below their intrinsic value. That’s the type of investor I am and that’s the type of company Clover Health is, currently. It is massively oversold and undervalued. Having said that, I am convinced rational investors will take notice and start buying this like there’s no tomorrow. Whether it’s the daily or the weekly chart, it looks perfect for anyone that’s thinking rationally about investing.
 
Short Squeeze Potential.
FTDs are through the roof. We know the day of reckoning is approaching (9-9-21). Currently, they are kicking the can down the road hoping for an economic disaster to strike so that they can cover on the way down. I am firmly convinced it won’t happen (short of a nuclear war or something irrational as that). The Fed and other central banks will keep interest rates low for a long time. It’s in our government’s interest (debt servicing) and the Fed won’t raise them until employment and price stability are where they should be. We are far from ideal targets with both.
 
Bullish Summary on $CLOV:
 
If you buy shares and hold them for five years, this will be a multi-bagger. It really is that simple. Buy it and forget it. This industry will be around as long as human beings roam the earth. Clover Health will only thrive in that world. A health care company infused with artificial intelligence that is disrupting an industry that still heavily relies on the fax machine.

the rate is currently being kept down and pressure is exerted on every good news. that for over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

in short, big pharma companies have overlooked success and now it is complicated to join paion. the last chance before great success is a hostile takeover.

this has to happen this year, as paion has already issued many licenses. Japan is already using remimazolam as an anesthetic. the success and the results are outstanding. usa, china, korea and europe start this year with remimazolam.

&amp;#x200B;

in china they are already going one step further and want to completely replace propophol with remimazolam as soon as possible. China has already carried out most of the extra studies in order to be able to use remimazolam safely in all areas. Japan has also come a long way with studies and is already testing children.

&amp;#x200B;

big pharma wants to buy paion and they have to buy paion. because remimazolam is safer and better than propohol.

&amp;#x200B;

this year is the last chance for a takeover and this should not happen at a cheap price.

remimazolam is showing great promise and shouldn't be bought cheap through a clandestine dirty takeover.

paion is still very unknown as paion hardly invests in marketing. for this they have created a safe anesthetic which is about to break through.

the hostile takeover from the usa is likely to be planned. every day suspicious orders are placed at the start of trading in new york time.

There are massive make or break moments coming up this week that will likely send $RKLB and $ASTR flying.

$ASTR has a flight window that opens on Friday when they will be launching both their first orbital flight and the first commercial payload ever. 

This is a massive step in the lifecycle of the company not least of which because it proves to potential customers that Astra is a legitimate, reliable launch service that is ready to fly. This comes after the news broke that Astra has locked in a 6 year FAA license for launching out of Kodiak Spaceport which is one of the first times the FAA has approved a location after a thorough environmental impact study, making it a significant step in long term capacity for flights.

$RKLB trades under this ticker starting tomorrow! Rocket Lab is the most promising space launch provider next to only SpaceX. They have a consistent and proven business model that has consistently adapted to the state of the industry, as is evident by the development of the neutron medium lift rocket to directly compete with the Falcon 9 with hopes of becoming human rated in the future. 

Rocket Lab has multiple streams of revenue and a great working relationship with some of the largest small sat providers on earth (Black sky for example) as well as NASA and the DOD who are both major big money clients of Rocket Lab. Idk why people have slept on it but Rocket Lab has received next to no media attention despite being the single best space play currently on the market. They have proven revenue streams and a consistent launch schedule launching out of more the then 3 launch sites, Itself owning Two launch complexes, one in New Zealand and the other in Virginia. 

They are the first and currently only company that has a dedicated spacecraft product for use in interplanetary missions and large scale scientific  explorations of our solar system. In the face of an international space race this capacity and product line are revolutionary to their business model.

I hold over 150 shares of VACQ accross multiple platforms and I hold over 100 shares of Astra as well. I have a shit ton in options too ik both.

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID (previously CCIV). I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-history).

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site[\*](https://insideevs.com/news/456169/lucid-motors-completed-amp1-plant-capacity-stands-30000/). Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase[\*](https://wccftech.com/lucid-group-lcid-opens-multiple-vacancies-related-to-finished-vehicles-as-the-company-moves-one-step-closer-to-initiating-deliveries/), with early construction already having begun[\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YH9m1mInVc). Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=59).

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""[\*](https://insideevs.com/news/517738/lucid-two-horse-race-tesla/) In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21[\*](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33393428/lucid-air-aerodynamics-drag-coefficient-specs/), bested only by the Mercedes EQS.  They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=19).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***[\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jgSdeVgr8): Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds[\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a34224854/lucid-air-with-3-electric-motors-laps-laguna-seca-in-1-31/). Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfpi4m9qbbj71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52856c525a7f880027f9510e77a7aee1dc648f7

https://preview.redd.it/vd3nd2nrbbj71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=452fd4594958b8fab6680b1af4fe75ce5bfad713

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I^(2)R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)[\*](https://youtu.be/lXD31SfCjIY?t=1326):

https://preview.redd.it/ap0xmqhtbbj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09c19ff7c93fb768fd369f3ecbe57f615ff2b61

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW[\*](https://www.porsche.com/usa/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-turbo/). The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW[\*](https://www.tesla.com/models).

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier[\*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF). While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)[\*](https://youtu.be/7ZkuJY1GWtE?t=312). Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells[\*](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127084_lucid-air-electric-sedan-builds-on-company-s-formula-e-experience). This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week[\*](https://www.everydayonsales.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/KFC-Holiday-Bucket-Promo.jpg).

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-proprietary-electric-drivetrain-technology-powers-record-setting-performance). It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance  and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities[\*](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/). Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available [here](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-announces-lucid-dreamdrive).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims  being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

https://preview.redd.it/6soi72lvbbj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d16ba6d5a0000fd2a1006e24bbe2b20ba9d2904

*\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*[\*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/11/electric-vehicle-incentives-infrastructure/)

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/future-models). Prototypes have already been built[\*](https://carbuzz.com/news/lucids-tesla-model-x-rival-spied-completely-undisguised) using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/oos6mt21cbj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe0279b81b7437bbf15f479d5207d7471ebeac9)

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=62).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=55). Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/charging).

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979[\*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/events/135227/alumni-spotlight-peter-rawlinson/). Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)[\*](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-announces-senior-engineering-and-manufacturing-executives). At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production[\*](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-12-tesla-chief-engineer-peter-rawlinson-geeks-out-with-us-about-mod.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJrjTpWt05Qoc0TfxoaUHcwrkuS_gSqFKSazihZIDOklzMjVzPIs1E3aGOn8__QaPZu2eVu-8tU3zFZ3QtBOJIFEIDrncY-dVHQZXKMk8bRrhHzTmi5grVvvVQq_88MoyqOU3KvalEYeDoxsXz_U6oQ2FdWt06_GdSmrg3ZUXKmw). Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-appoints-peter-rawlinson-ceo). Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter[\*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303495330223198208?lang=en); however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted[\*](https://insideevs.com/news/505126/elon-musk-tweet-rawlinson-not-chief-engineer/).

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021[\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherry-house). Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)[\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo). She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/derek-jenkins). Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally[\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-jenkins-2016483b). Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/eric-bach). At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com[\*](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lucid-Motors-Reviews-E698305_P2.htm). There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly[\*](https://www.lucidmotors.com/careers/search/), expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year[\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35823089/lucid-motors-ceo-defends-its-financial-practices/).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020 ([graph](https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cars-vs-evs-per-1000-people.jpg))[\*](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/lcid-stock-trust-historical-trends/). This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*[*\**](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/3872fdce-91c5-468b-a127-c2b598bd8691)*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year*[*\**](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-093160/)*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=65). Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=66).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=39).  They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life[\*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/). Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

[Lucid Energy Storage System \(ESS\)](https://preview.redd.it/343itvu7cbj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7db0bff3d1f59892252edf8ced60b3c029b1b6c)

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022[\*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/saudi-backed-lucid-in-talks-for-electric-car-factory-near-jeddah) and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018[\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002). If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA/financials)|18.33[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/ps_ratio)|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TM/financials)|0.81[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TM/ps_ratio)|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DE/XHAM/VOW/financials)|0.51[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/VWAGY/ps_ratio)|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM/financials)|0.51[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/GM/ps_ratio)|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO/financials)|12.7[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio)|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HNDAF/financials)|0.37[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/HMC/ps_ratio)|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F/financials)|0.37[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/F/ps_ratio)|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/XPEV/financials)|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LI/financials)|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/FSR/financials)|N/A|

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=65). *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion[\*](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html?c1futurevalue=22800000&amp;c1yearsv=4.25&amp;c1interestratev=10&amp;x=64&amp;y=17#future-money). *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52[\*](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_valuation_ttm.php?ps&amp;s=1000) so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO[\*](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2021-05-28/electric-vehicle-firm-rivian-could-seek-70-billion-valuation-in-ipo-bloomberg-news).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD \(8\/24\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/24wlugi9cbj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be0c984b4eaf528ba624b808170b4b39e5bd80a)

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend ([tweet](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1429935712447565824)). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too[\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS1oQTnnqzq/?hl=en).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 ([page 169](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921098447/tm2123573-3_s1.htm)). Here's a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/) thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however [he speculated it may be October (Q4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p9jcte/update_from_jonny_liebermans_ig_story/).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""[\*](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063#page=8).

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue [here](https://cheddar.com/media/ev-maker-lucid-motors-ipo-ceo-q4-vehicle-delivery) (start at 4:00).

**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (example*** [1](https://preview.redd.it/tb2p3flhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a900df13b5d4f24a1433af338cf3b7ba19091b29)***,*** [2](https://preview.redd.it/81itpelhvji71.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e8a23399b31462f914be74fbf708d4df89d732)***,*** [3](https://preview.redd.it/qeje8har6aj71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ac773d093076d049ee46aae30516bbefe554b1)***,*** [4](https://preview.redd.it/r4jfpqus3zi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a90639a2bdc1244193db88e6b987af31583099)***)***

**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021).  Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers[\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p8a5v7/beware_peter_rawlinson_is_the_last_surviving/).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID (previously CCIV). I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish ""DD."" I also had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum. All links to Lucid's website had to be removed because WSB has it flagged.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site[\*](https://insideevs.com/news/456169/lucid-motors-completed-amp1-plant-capacity-stands-30000/). Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase[\*](https://wccftech.com/lucid-group-lcid-opens-multiple-vacancies-related-to-finished-vehicles-as-the-company-moves-one-step-closer-to-initiating-deliveries/), with early construction already having begun[\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YH9m1mInVc). Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""[\*](https://insideevs.com/news/517738/lucid-two-horse-race-tesla/) In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21[\*](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33393428/lucid-air-aerodynamics-drag-coefficient-specs/), bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***[\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3jgSdeVgr8): Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds[\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a34224854/lucid-air-with-3-electric-motors-laps-laguna-seca-in-1-31/). Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)[\*](https://youtu.be/lXD31SfCjIY?t=1326):

https://preview.redd.it/6vwey9mihbj71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1d2c3190a03ad0c16cb7f8d4f8b2b73435288c9

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW[\*](https://www.porsche.com/usa/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-turbo/). The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW[\*](https://www.tesla.com/models).

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier[\*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-lucid-motors/lg-chem-to-exclusively-supply-ev-batteries-to-u-s-based-lucid-motors-idUSKCN20I2OF). While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)[\*](https://youtu.be/7ZkuJY1GWtE?t=312). Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells[\*](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127084_lucid-air-electric-sedan-builds-on-company-s-formula-e-experience). This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week[\*](https://www.everydayonsales.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/KFC-Holiday-Bucket-Promo.jpg).

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities[\*](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/). Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

https://preview.redd.it/0yjdk67khbj71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76656cb5374ade6c508bee92238d65f1aa23eb3b

*\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*[\*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/08/11/electric-vehicle-incentives-infrastructure/)

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built[\*](https://carbuzz.com/news/lucids-tesla-model-x-rival-spied-completely-undisguised) using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/8egwb3hlhbj71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7961ac8bfe67a1c3654bee97b85c05d86659ce)

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979[\*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/events/135227/alumni-spotlight-peter-rawlinson/). Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)[\*](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-announces-senior-engineering-and-manufacturing-executives). At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production[\*](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-12-tesla-chief-engineer-peter-rawlinson-geeks-out-with-us-about-mod.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJrjTpWt05Qoc0TfxoaUHcwrkuS_gSqFKSazihZIDOklzMjVzPIs1E3aGOn8__QaPZu2eVu-8tU3zFZ3QtBOJIFEIDrncY-dVHQZXKMk8bRrhHzTmi5grVvvVQq_88MoyqOU3KvalEYeDoxsXz_U6oQ2FdWt06_GdSmrg3ZUXKmw). Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter[\*](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303495330223198208?lang=en); however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted[\*](https://insideevs.com/news/505126/elon-musk-tweet-rawlinson-not-chief-engineer/).

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021[\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherry-house). Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)[\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo). She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally[\*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-jenkins-2016483b). Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com[\*](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lucid-Motors-Reviews-E698305_P2.htm). There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year[\*](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a35823089/lucid-motors-ceo-defends-its-financial-practices/).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020 ([graph](https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cars-vs-evs-per-1000-people.jpg))[\*](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/lcid-stock-trust-historical-trends/). This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021**\***. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year*[*\**](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-093160/)*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

https://preview.redd.it/ds777ywphbj71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7fe8165ccfc777ae54071d4266587d9239f91d

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life[\*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/). Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

[Lucid Energy Storage System \(ESS\)](https://preview.redd.it/pe6s1c6rhbj71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2f301a679eb4e9c2d01cf448f979587519147f)

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022[\*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/saudi-backed-lucid-in-talks-for-electric-car-factory-near-jeddah) and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018[\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002). If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA/financials)|18.33[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/ps_ratio)|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TM/financials)|0.81[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/TM/ps_ratio)|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DE/XHAM/VOW/financials)|0.51[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/VWAGY/ps_ratio)|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM/financials)|0.51[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/GM/ps_ratio)|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO/financials)|12.7[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/ps_ratio)|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HNDAF/financials)|0.37[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/HMC/ps_ratio)|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F/financials)|0.37[\*](https://ycharts.com/companies/F/ps_ratio)|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/XPEV/financials)|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LI/financials)|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)[\*](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/US/FSR/financials)|N/A|

&amp;#x200B;

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion[\*](https://www.calculator.net/present-value-calculator.html?c1futurevalue=22800000&amp;c1yearsv=4.25&amp;c1interestratev=10&amp;x=64&amp;y=17#future-money). *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52[\*](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_valuation_ttm.php?ps&amp;s=1000) so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO[\*](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2021-05-28/electric-vehicle-firm-rivian-could-seek-70-billion-valuation-in-ipo-bloomberg-news).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD \(8\/24\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/mzpxtdjthbj71.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939a2a8df5445403e49942ccbb163a72c7893226)

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend ([tweet](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors/status/1429935712447565824)). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too[\*](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS1oQTnnqzq/?hl=en).

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 ([page 169](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921098447/tm2123573-3_s1.htm)). Here's a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oss4my/why_pipes_wont_sell_off_all_their_lcid_shares/) thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however [he speculated it may be October (Q4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/p9jcte/update_from_jonny_liebermans_ig_story/).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""\*.

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers.

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

This morning, Paysafe also announced a deal with Glory, to ""improve access to the digital economy  for the estimated 2 billion people globally who remain unbanked""

Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech.

Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.”

To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \~ $105 billion)

So why the miss?  Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.

The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.  With half the volume short, real sellers are drying up. Seems buyers are patiently waiting for short sellers to exhaust themselves. With only 3 million shares left available to short, this could come any moment.

Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:

&amp;#x200B;

* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion
* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA
* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million
* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.
* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)
* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)
* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)
* Revenue growth in all segments
* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)
* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY
* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)
* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance
* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs
* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.
* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce

&amp;#x200B;

Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.”  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)

With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.

Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.”

This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.

Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.”

These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

&amp;#x200B;

Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;

Paysafe vs PayPal

Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine.""  The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.

In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe’s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:

1. PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.
2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.
3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.
4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).
5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%.
6. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60
7. Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40.
8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.

* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.
* Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%.

There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32.

This is not investment advice. Just a collections observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

To get you familiar Old Republic is an American property insurance and title and deed company. That have been doing extremely good. Beating wall street analyst expected earnings number for the last four quarters and have experienced exceptional growth during that time. The big boys have took notice of this stock and all the sweet dividends that they pay out every quarter and have been snatching up shares for a while so much so that more than 70% of the float is owned by institutions. And their still buying more ever since they announced the special dividend.

Now I'm gonna keep it simple for you monkeys. Theirs are two ways to play this either buy shares to get the sweets dividends that they pay out every quarter or get in on the low IV options. And enjoy the profits from the run up.

The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries.

If you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research.

But first things first, let's revise the original bet, \[the underlying post and analysis\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\_revive\_the\_buried\_wsb\_culture\_gme\_to/).

# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:

*Processing img 5sldutzq33j71...*

The thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:

*Processing img h7b6sm9t43j71...*

*Processing img iz041qtv43j71...*

  
\[The OC post and analysis\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\_revive\_the\_buried\_wsb\_culture\_gme\_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.

*Processing img ncwwuqz253j71...*

  
Does it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:

*Processing img 58sg96eg53j71...*

Looks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like

*Processing img nltp4a1l53j71...*

There are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.

You might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.

Furthermore, take a look at this:

*Processing img 44m2qp2q53j71...*

  
What you see above is the screenshot from \[my other post\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme\_to\_amc\_and\_bb\_last\_week\_ladies\_go\_first\_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it’s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \*\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\*\*: manipulation.

Apes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:

*Processing img klztgzo563j71...*

As you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a ‘memestonk’? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **σ (sigma)** and **β (beta**).

# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021

&amp;#x200B;

Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a \[Bloomberg article\](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  


&gt;A “black swan” event — made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life — comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren’t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A “five-sigma event” is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.

  
Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.  


For example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:

*Processing img 47plfcth63j71...*

One of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets’ health, and it seem to have already begun.

However, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  


&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.

I strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.

To quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  


&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!

*Processing img enhgxe0773j71...*

*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*

*Processing img 2pb2k9qv63j71...*

This represents what Buffet called “A Time Bomb” in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,

*Processing img xct7amb273j71...*

and the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.

Thanks God, they promised not to do that again!

*Processing video 1rflh5jy33j71...*

  
\*\*In Tyler’s voice\*\* So that was a fucking lie:

*Processing img f9xgxitt73j71...*

The figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn’t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what’s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang’s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.

Another important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I’m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: ‘Stonks only go up’. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):

*Processing img zfh3tjyk83j71...*

&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.

  
No wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can’t live without the always following stimulus “dose”. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we’ll find out really soon what happens then.

To conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:  


&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there’s “no risk” of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**

# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)

  
Well, here comes the party pooper, or it’s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:

*Processing img nw7vw0dk93j71...*

*Processing img ebo8be5r93j71...*

*Processing img kqwqmy9t93j71...*

Connecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man’s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it’s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there’s no tomorrow, things look like this:

* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,
* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,
* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).

That was just a preview.

Late January events are extraordinary, that’s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it’s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).

After a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that’s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the ‘Butterfly Effect’ movie? Oh,  


&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...

  
**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I’m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn’t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**

I mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained \[here\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the\_big\_short\_20\_why\_bears\_may\_soon\_reconsider/), and \[here\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this\_time\_its\_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.

**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon.

Only time will tell.

This coming week Amarin's drug Vascepa will be prestented at ESC congess on Aug 29th with results showing it pay help treat COVID patients. If you can, I suggest to go watch the results that day.

Also last moment to trade shares once the COVID treatment results comeout will be on the Frankfurt exchange.

Recent article below by Amarin's CEO below. Put in bold what he said was important.

Then, in March 2020, U.S federal courts invalidated several patents for Vascepa, opening the door to generic competition and potentially shrinking sales of the company’s once-promising drug.

Amarin’s stock price fell by 50% virtually overnight.

The court rulings could have been a death sentence for a company like Amarin. Instead, it has rebounded with a risky, unusually aggressive strategy for a small drugmaker that markets and sells a single pill.

Karim Mikhail, Amarin’s CEO and a 22-year veteran of Merck, said the company will launch sales of Vascepa next month in the European Union and plans to expand into Asia and Africa next year. The company also has added sales staff to battle generic drugmakers for U.S. sales.

“People who fought for the value that this product brings to the market are not letting go today,” he said. “They risked their careers … to prove a point that this product brings enormous benefit.”

It plans to thread the needle to profitability with overseas sales and fighting off U.S. generic competitors by pushing doctors to prescribe Vascepa to more heart patients. Here in the U.S., it must do so by selling a drug that on average costs 77% more than generics.

J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye still believes Vascepa will be successful, she said in investor notes, but sales will ramp up over 10 years.

This month, former Amarin CEO John Thero was succeeded by Mikhail, Merck’s former chief marketing officer in Europe and emerging markets. His appointment and the expansion of Amarin’s sales staff indicated the company plans to go it alone.

“Investors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near-term merger and acquisition on the table (which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock),” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a recent investor note.

Big pharmaceutical companies typically buy up startups to avoid the risk and expense of drug development. But companies like Amarin are rarely acquisition targets, according to studies by Michael Kinch, director of the Center for Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

Vascepa joins a long list of cardiovascular drugs over the past two decades dominated by blockbusters marketed by Pfizer, Merck, Schering-Plough and AstraZeneca.

The most commonly prescribed heart medicines are today available as low-cost generics. And generics typically capture 95% of the brand-name’s sales three months after generic drugs hits the market, according to Wall Street analysts.

The generic version of Vascepa, has not experienced that level of success.

Mikhail said Vascepa was notoriously difficult to manufacture and the raw ingredients difficult to acquire in bulk. “Clearly, the generics never thought they would win this case,” he said. “The evidence is they were not ready with supply.”

The FDA says Vascepa’s mechanism in action to reduce stroke and heart attacks is “not completely understood.” Amarin claims the drug has anti-inflammatory properties and it has announced several academic centers are studying Vascepa as a possible treatment for colorectal cancer as well as Covid.

Mikhail said preliminary Covid study data is scheduled for release next week at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.

**“You look at what Covid patients die from, they mostly die because of an inflammatory storm,” he said. “If the study is positive, and it has value in delaying progression in Covid patients … that would be incredible.”**

**It would also give Amarin another escape hatch to deliver shareholder value.**",wallstreetbets,$PFE buying $TRIL will $AMRN be next,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa050t/pfe_buying_tril_will_amrn_be_next/

**Owning Shares of a Chinese company as a foreigner.** 

**TL:DR** \- when you buy shares of a Chinese company on a american/european/hk/non-chinese exchange are buying shares of usually a Cayman shell company with some contractual rights to the Chinese company. 

Below is a quote from a bloomberg opinion article that lays it out better. 

&gt; With Chinese companies this sort of thing is generally called a  “variable interest entity.” You set up a company in the Cayman Islands  that can be owned by anyone. The Caymans company enters into a series of  contracts with the local Chinese company, giving it, not ownership, but  certain carefully curated economic interests and control rights over  the Chinese company. Then you list the Caymans company in the U.S., and  people buy its stock, and they sort of pretend that they’re buying stock  in the Chinese company — they sort of pretend that the Chinese company  is a *subsidiary* of the Caymans holding company — even though  really they’re only buying an empty shell that has certain contractual  relationships with the Chinese company. ^(1)

&amp;#x200B;

**What's happening now?**

**TL:DR -** The CCP revealed a 5 year plan^(2) on 8/11 essentially indicating they plan on cracking down on businesses for the next 5 years. We're just starting to see it with the fines and new laws dropping.

So whats happening now, and causing Chinese stocks to drill to the center of the earth? On 8/11 the CCP revealed a 5 year plan outlining their plans for tighter regulations on the Chinese economy. I can't read chinese hieroglyphs and google translate butchers it. So my best resource has been news articles. I'll be pulling alot from a BBC article as its been the best at outlining the current situation.   
 

&gt;It said laws will be strengthened for ""important fields"" such as science and technological innovation, culture and education.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plan also said the Chinese government aims to tackle monopolies and ""foreign-related rule of law"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Regulations  relating to China's digital economy, including ""internet finance,  artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing etc."" will also be  reviewed.^(3)

The BBC articles goes out to outline recent actions by the CCP.

&gt;Beijing  has already launched anti-monopoly investigations into some of the  country's biggest technology firms and taken action against a wide range  of other businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;In April, technology giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8bn (£2bn) fine after an investigation found that it had abused its dominant market position for years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last month, Tencent was told to end exclusive music licensing deals with record labels around the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also  in July, some of the country's biggest online platforms - Kuaishou,  Tencent's messaging tool QQ, Alibaba's Taobao and Weibo - were ordered  to remove inappropriate child-related content.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  week, Chinese authorities said they had increased their scrutiny of  after-school tuition services offered by individual teachers.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
 Last month, Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn  private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition  on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations. 

On 8/20 China passed a new personal data privacy law.^(4) Not necessarily bad, and similar in nature to Europe's GDPR. This is just another step in the CCP efforts to further regulate the economy. 

&gt;The  law states that handling of personal information must have clear and  reasonable purpose and shall be limited to the ""minimum scope necessary  to achieve the goals of handling"" data.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  also lays out conditions for which companies can collect personal data,  including obtaining an individual's consent, as well as laying out  guidelines for ensuring data protection when data is transferred outside  the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  law further calls for handlers of personal information to designate an  individual in charge of personal information protection, and for  handlers to conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the law.

**Other risks**

This part will be slightly Fuddy, but I still think should be shared. Back when DiDi was drilling this news came out. 

&gt; Regulators in Beijing are planning rule changes that would allow them to  block a Chinese company from listing overseas even if the unit selling  shares is incorporated outside China, closing a loophole long-used by  the country’s technology giants, according to people familiar with the  matter.   
&gt;  
&gt;... the VIE framework  has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless  enabled Chinese companies to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment  in sensitive sectors including the Internet industry. The structure  allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity --  registered in places like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin  Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the  structure, it’s become increasingly worrisome for Beijing as it  tightens its grip on technology firms that have infiltrated every corner  of Chinese life and control reams of consumer data. Authorities so far  have little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as  with the recent Didi Global Inc. IPO, which went ahead despite requests for a delay from regulators.^(5)

In another article

&gt; In its brief statement on Tuesday, the State Council said rules for  overseas listings will be revised and publicly-traded firms will be held  accountable for keeping their data secure. It also said China will step  up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets. ^(6)

This article was another interesting take on what could happen with some Chinese companies. 

&gt; If China moves bring down Didi’s share price and it forces new investors  on the company, it would look a lot like the scenario that Jesse Fried,  a professor of law at Harvard University, laid out to MarketWatch early  last week. Basically, he sees the opportunity for China to drive down  the price of these companies before having rich Chinese investors take  them private at a lower price.    
&gt;  
&gt;“Chinese companies that list here often end up going private. The  people who control a company they plan to take private may release bad  news and withhold good news so the stock goes down, and then buy back  the firm’s stock at a very low price,” Fried said. “This happens not  only with Chinese go-privates, but also with American ones too. It won’t  happen with a company like Alibaba BABA, which is too big to take private, but it can happen with smaller companies.”     
&gt;  
&gt;One example he gave was Qihoo 360, which like most Chinese IPOs  was domiciled in the Cayman Islands with a structure that gave U.S.  shareholders no real voice. In late 2015, the company announced a deal  to be taken private by a group of investors led by its CEO Zhou Hongyi,  who had a 61% majority stake. The go-private deal valued Qihoo at about  $9.3 billion, but after it relisted in Shanghai, its shares soared to a  $56 billion valuation in 2017. Fried noted in this article in the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance that Quihoo’s CEO made $12 billion alone in relisting the company. ^(7)

IAmPattycakes,t2_fopgm,1629730917,pa1lj0,True,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa1lj0/ambarella_the_quiet_computer_vision_company/,1,"Hey all, I’m just some tech nerd who likes to dabble in investing and ""investing."" However, there is a company that I’m interacting with that, frankly, I’m surprised hasn’t blown up higher than they are. Figured I’d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love. 

Ambarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued. 

# Competition:

Basically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost. 

AMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in. 

I am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA. 

# Catalysts:

AMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I’ll let those people talk more about what’s going on there, I’m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I’m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they’ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I’m hoping they get. 

Having more customers as a semiconductor company creating products on high end process nodes is *basically free* when you’re running in lower quantities. Why? How? Well it just comes down to the massive non-recurring costs in semiconductor manufacturing. This is something the semiconductor people know well, but I’ll give a rough outline for those of you not in the know. Manufacturing silicon on the most cutting edge nodes is insanely expensive, even if you’re just wanting to produce one single die, you’re spending tens, or hundreds of millions of dollars just to make the patterns to make your chip. For TSMC 7nm it’s likely in the hundred to hundreds of millions of dollars that you have to spend once. Every single wafer you buy gets made with those patterns. Each wafer costs money of course, but each one pales in comparison to the amount you spend in the actual photomasks to make your chips.

If they end up selling more chips, the NR costs get spread out over more, allowing either more competitive pricing if they want, or just more profit. With what is probably 100k of their top end chip sales public, that's a big deal for AMBA as each of their chips costs probably ~$50 to make, and probably sells for significant multiples of that. They are also definitely selling many more than that in more low-end devices like security cameras and action cameras, but that's not the high end flashy cool tech so I'm not gonna bore everyone with that. 

# Future: 

This is more of a ""what I see and what I want"" kinda section. I'm very much an outsider, and it's very hard to get any word from the company, so everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. 

I can definitely see AMBA upping their software friendliness and taking a page out of Nvidia's book and making a Jetson competitor. As I said in the title, they're a very quiet company. I would have never heard about them had I not been working with building software for action cameras. Getting their products and software into the hands of real developers to create products with their chips, regardless of if they sell 100 or 100k would be good for sales directly, and massive for brand recognition. AMBA is competing directly with custom silicon, like what's in Tesla, Waymo in my opinion, and if they can get a good enough product that it's worth these big companies not spending hundreds of millions to make their own silicon and instead just using the CV2 processor or whatever comes next, that's be great. I'm seeing the same thing that happened way back in the 90s with companies that had their own custom processors just moving to Intel or AMD because it just didn't make sense to spend the money designing and building their own processor when they could just use someone else's. If AMBA could become the Intel or AMD of computer vision, that's be pretty huge.

However, there is a company that I’m interacting with that, frankly, I’m surprised hasn’t blown up higher than they are. Figured I’d share it on a much more popular place, because I think it deserves a little love. 

Ambarella ($AMBA) is a somewhat small (3.4B market cap as of writing this) semiconductor company that seems to be very focused on creating the best computer vision processors out there. They also make really good, normal application processors that have fantastic video processing capabilities. I've gotten my hands on them a bit, not as much as I would like, but I see some promise in their new stuff and think they're undervalued. 

# Competition:

Basically if you think of AI vision processing you probably have the one behemoth in mind: Nvidia. How the hell is this company that's worth 1/200th of Nvidia going to compete? Well it comes down to architecture. Nvidia slams the same design from their top end A series card to their lowest end GPU, designed for hardcore parallel processing like you would expect a GPU to be. This works for sure, but it is inefficient for pure vision processing, compared to a purpose built processor. Ambarella can do stereoscopic vision processing in their highest end processor in a silicon die that's probably at least 5x smaller than Nvidia's highest end processor, at likely significantly less cost too. That's a big deal for both power efficiency, and pure cost. 

AMBA is also one of two companies that has an AI vision and video processing API with AWS. I bet you can guess the other one. That's great for developers to get used to the ecosystem, and easy access to new talent that may be able to bring their employer in. 

I am unaware of any other company that has nearly the level of ability in their processors for computer vision. With the constant increase of self driving startups out there, I can only imagine that AMBA playing at the top of the field alone will be huge, as not every single company can afford hundreds of millions to design their own silicon, like Tesla did after moving away from NVDA. 

# Catalysts:

AMBA is holding their earnings one week from now, August 31st. This will be the first earnings that they are going to have been working with ARVL and KeepTruckin. KeepTruckin handles 90,000 drivers in the US currently, and ARVL has at least 10k sales planned in the future. I’ll let those people talk more about what’s going on there, I’m not up to date with the car manufacturer space and I’m pretty sure that they were a meme stock at some point, so they’ll probably go crazy talking about all their sales that I’m hoping they get.

What I watched unfold next was the single most beautiful dumpster fire I've ever seen or will ever see again.

I sat in absolute awe as this hedgefund (Melvin Capital) realised that not only had they poked a sleeping bear, but they had also locked themselves in the cage with it.

Every spare moment I had for the following weeks I spent checking for updates on the greatest battle in recent history, WSB vs MC.

I watched as they cried at their losses while other hedge funds attempted to prop them up, at the cost of their own stability. I watched as Robinhood sought to limit the damages, betraying its own investors in the process.

But no matter how ugly it would get, WSB refused to budge, doing its best to drive the prices sky high.

Then one day, I log on and read the brilliant news - MC has finally closed its positions and accepted the loss of over $6 billion.

I had just witnessed one of the craziest failures I've ever seen, a short squeeze that turned into a record breaking loss. A hedgefund completely derailed by a group of fucking redditors.

Words fail to describe the joy this saga brought me, in a time where heroes are few and far between, all of you banded together and tore apart the very epitome of greed and corruption.

I hope to see you all gather together again and continue the assault on these bastards.

Let's have a quick look at AMC and some possible scenarios for next week.

TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Price Action**

AMC is currently consolidating between 29 and 39 usd. Selling pressure has considerably slowed down in the last 4-5 weeks. Neither bears nor bulls are currently in control, the price action overall is pretty neutral. It looks like AMC is bottoming out, and has entered it's next accumulation phase, which is signaled by a period of relatively low volatility and volume which could go on over several more weeks.

Since the third of august, AMC has been trading in a relatively small upwards channel, in blue on the chart below, and I expect this to continue for a while. 

I expect the price to eventually break the red resistance line, retesting it, and then moving to the upper bound of the blue channel. I have marked this possible scenario with a green line in the chart below.

&amp;#x200B;

**MACD**

The MACD is still green and signalizes a possible continuation the price to the upside.

 **RSI** 

The RSI is climbing, together with the price, after making a double bottom on the 4th of august:

**TLDR - Points of interest**

Long  Positions: I am looking for an entry on the lower bound of the blue channel, if price falls down  there again. I am also looking for a break of the red resistance  for a rally to around 39. If 39 breaks, I am looking at around 42.5.

Short  Positions: I am looking for a bounce either off the red resistance, or the upper bound of the blue channel, back to the lower bound of the blue channel. If the lower bound of the blue channel breaks, price could go down to 29 again.

For the rest of you who are actually decend people, I have the sweetest of DD. It's broken down in two parts:

1. The single most compelling argument to load up on $SONY: PSN
2. The rest of the business

**PSN and Netflix: what the fuck is going on here?**

Let's assume Sony sold nothing but PSN subscriptions. This company would not be too dissimilar to Netflix as:

1. Their stream of revenue comes from subscriptions (avg monthly price on Netflix: $10, PSN $8\*).
2. Their main cost is keeping the servers up and running.
3. Netflix would also have to pay for production and licensing, so I expect Sony to have a better margin. Beacause of this, I assume their net monthly income from a single user to be the same.
4. Future subscribers growth will be flat for both companies.

Currently, Netflix has 209 million subscribers and a market cap of $242B.

PSN has 109 million subscribers. If we agree on the 4 points I mentioned above, the **market cap of PSN alone** would be $126B, based on Netflix's standards.

The current market cap of Sony is (drum roll...) $122B. According to SONY's latest earning release, gaming (TOTAL Playstation universe, etc., not just PSN subscriptions!) will represent 33% of total 2021 income.

Make as many counterarguments as you want (Netflix will grow more, the value of a PSN subscriber is worth less, etc...), but even if we slash my assumed PSN market cap in half, we are **so far away** from a fair valuation of $SONY.

**The business**

Let's have a look at a couple of other numbers to understand if $SONY's low valuation is justified by a terrible business.

Operating income (year ended March): 2018 JPY 730B. 2019 JPY 826B. 2020 JPY 832B. 2021 JPY 968B. TTM JPY 1,022B. -&gt; they are growing income

Cash Flow: I'm too lazy to type in all numbers but they went from (JPY B) 1,2T in 2018 to 1,4T TTM. So no big growth, but stable.

P/E: 11

Profit margin: 13%

Price/book: 0.02 ( 😮 )

Enterprise Value/EBITDA: 1.20

Intangible assets as % of total assets: 6,8% (and they have the PlayStation brand among all others... Just for a comparison, Netflix's ratio is 64%).

Also, they beat 9/10 of latest earnings:

I personally don't like the numbers here. There is no thrill in investing in something that is not a loss-making, overvalued, declining business  😴 . This is a beautiful money making machine that I am paying 2% of BOOK VALUE for. Too easy.

Positions:

Sold 11 cash covered puts at various strikes, up to $105.

IV is low, so I'm planning to add some leaps.

Gas reserves: 

* Russia owns the worlds largest natural gas reserves
* Gazprom holds 70% of russias natural gas reserves; making up 16% of global reserves; in numbers thats north of 24,000 bcm; they also hold 1,100 million tons of gas condensates and 1,400 million tons of oil
* Gazprom is carrying out geological exploration

* Gas transportation volumes of biggest pipelines from 2016 and 2020 (in bcm/y): Power of siberia (opened in 2019), 4.10; Nord stream 43.79, 59.28 (04.28 over max capacity); blue stream 13.06, 8.76; TurkStream (opened in 2020), 13.51

* Nord stream 2 to be opened in autumn 2021; max capacity 55 bcm/y (same as Nord stream); in germanys elections this autumn, two probable candidates are against Nord Stream 2. Russia is aware, and is draining gas transports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline and through the Net4Gas pipelines (situated further south of the Yamal-Europe pipeline) to drain german gas reserves, increasing fear over gas and energy outages

&amp;#x200B;

**Discussion:**

* Although Gazproms success greatly depends on gas prices (which are on record highs right now), the companies shares have not reflected on that (yet?); most commodities are sold with futures, meaning that gazprom might not yet have fully capitalized on the high natural gas and oil prices

https://preview.redd.it/9wxa62swnxi71.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0205cb3b0f7632b080f334bedcdc1536d775da66

*blue – gazprom ADR share price*

*light grey – ttf natural gas price*

*dark grey – brent oil prices*

&amp;#x200B;

* Company development: 
* \-- Compared to global reserves, gazproms % has decreased. Due to increased exploration, which wouldnt be conducted if natural gas wouldnt have a future
* \-- Capital expenditures are high, often critizised; after 2020, capex was cut 20% to cut costs; author didnt look into this too much
* \-- Largest foreign customers: UK decreased due to sanctions, although they actually need gas; netherlands increased natural gas purchases dramatically; China increased purchases from 1.5 to 5 bcm/y from 2019 to 2020; UK decrease is easily compensated by netherlands and chinas increased consumption; with the new soyuz pipeline to china (capacity 50bcm/y), their demand must be exptected internally to increase 5-10 fold

&amp;#x200B;

* Gas reserves &amp; pipelines: 
* \-- fears over storage inventories in europe; there appear to be problems at the Yamal pipeline at the german border (at Mallnow compressor station); however these are fake fears and problems: russia is draining german gas storages by delivering too little gas, thus putting pressure on the new german government to commit to Nord Stream 2
* \-- LNG (liquefied natural gas) seems more attractive as pipeline natural gas becomes more expensive; LNG prices rise in the US; but shipbrokers say LNG tankers have 14 day delays without reservation (for context: for long distance transport, LNG tankers are cheaper than pipelines. But if the pipelines exist already (in this case fully paid by Gazprom), and the customer just pays for the gas, the pipeline gas is cheaper)
* \-- Nord Stream pipeline is over 4 bcm/y over capacity; Nord Stream 2 is planned to be opened in autumn 2021; also, Nord Stream 2 circumvents Ukraine and Poland that caused problems repeatedly in the past (extorted russia &amp; illegaly tapping pipelines)

&amp;#x200B;

* Demand for natural gas generally: 
* \-- Western europe is the dominating gas market for Gazprom, with China picking up demand
* \-- British gas production has decreased
* \-- Netherlands gas production has decreased (Groningen gas field is used up); also pointed at by the largest foreign customers numbers where Netherlands demand is sharply rising
* \-- Other natural gas producers for western europe such as norway, lybia and jordania do not have significant impact

&amp;#x200B;

* EU is performing the „Energiewende“, meaning a drastic CO2-reduction
* \-- Lead to an explosion of CO2-emission certificate prices; currently &gt;50 Eur/ton
* \-- Hard coal (lignite even more so) has double the CO2 emissions compared to gas (per MWh electric produced)
* \-- When the CO2 price level tops 30Eur/ton, gas power plants take over the coal power plants in the so called „merit order“ and run base load
* \-- The german Energiewende (rapid investment in Wind and Solar) compensates the nuclear exit, but nothing more as of now; so the fossil energy is still needed
* \-- The (already put into laws) YoY increasing CO2-charge on e.g. domestic heating market leads to a quick exchange of oil heating towards gas heating (currently western germany has 6-9 months of waiting time in the orderbooks for connection of houses to the local gas grid system)

&amp;#x200B;

* Political aspects: 
* \-- Nord Stream 2 was under immense political pressure both from the US and EU members over fear of increased russian influence; the US critic is of hypocritic nature though, because they want to sell LNG gas via tankers to europe; Nord Stream 2 is almost completed though, and paid for by russia; the argument of russia extorting europe via gas outages is almost non-existent; both of the authors contacts agree that once russia signs a gas&amp;oil contract, they stand with their word. (not like china with their rare earth price fluctuations..) Furthermore, Nord Stream 2 circumvents Ukraine. This is important because Ukraine extorted Russia via pipeline shut-offs and illegally tapping on pipelines; of course the ukrainian security position will worsen because russia is less dependent on them (but this effect is more or less self-inflicted) 
* \-- Yukos: some will remember the politically motivated 2003-2006 Yukos collapse – once a russian oil&amp;gas giant. This scenario is unlikely for Gazprom since CEO Miller is close to Putin, already in place since 2001, and Gazprom is more than 50% state-owned
* \-- Russian cash draining: there are reports that sub-contractors and the state are pulling cash from Gazprom, which reduces profits and dividends; (e.g.: [https://www.gazeta.ru/business/2020/05/28/13099087.shtml](https://www.gazeta.ru/business/2020/05/28/13099087.shtml)) ; this has to be expected in Russia (also because Russia is in need of foreign currency, especially Euro and USD); however they want to keep the cash-cow growing
* \-- Too big to fail: for both sides, russia and europe, Gazprom is the backbone pillar of energy production; russia will defend it
* \-- Europe wants to lower CO2 output, gas is a good alternative to oil and coal; and Russia does not (yet?) care about global warming, because it enables them to use once permafrosted land in their northern parts – which coincedentally are expected to be rich in gas and other commodities

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions &amp; Positions**

* Gazproms dominating market is western europe and Chinas demand increasing; gas reserves growing faster than production; pipelines working well; record gas prices
* Fundamental european situation:
* \-- UK now net importer, not exporter anymore
* \-- Netherlands Groningen production decreased
* \-- European Energiewende – making Gas a better option than hard coal and lignite because of lower CO2 output
* \-- German renewable Energiewende compensates for nuclear exit, but nothing more
* \-- CO2-charge prices expected to increase; gas heating replacing oil heating
* \-- Nord Stream 2 soon to be opened, cheaper than LNG tanker gas and circumventing Ukraine
* Political aspects: 
* \-- Risks associated with Russian state governance; has to keep governmental budget alive (unpredictable taxes/charges situation); but Russia is a reliable partner, and CEO Miller is close with Putin making a Yukos situation unlikely; subcontractors might be draining some money and high Capex

All in all, Gas demand is expected to grow in the next years; high gas prices and good pipeline capacities outweigh some money draining towards the russian state. The Gazprom story does not end before the EU ends CO2-charges (not under discussion). Next earnings on 31/08, but this is a long play into 2022-2023. 

Position: 2,000 shares, looking to add earnings calls before 31/08 (happy to share pos. with mods)

Gas reserves: 

* Russia owns the worlds largest natural gas reserves
* Gazprom holds 70% of russias natural gas reserves; making up 16% of global reserves; in numbers thats north of 24,000 bcm; they also hold 1,100 million tons of gas condensates and 1,400 million tons of oil
* Gazprom is carrying out geological exploration
* Growth rates of Gazproms natural gas reserves surpass production rates since 2005

&amp;#x200B;

Gas pipelines: 

* main existing gas export routes: yamal-europe; nord stream; urengoy-pomary-uzhgorod; soyuz; progress; blue stream (offshore part); turkstream (offshore part); power of siberia
* Gas transportation volumes of biggest pipelines from 2016 and 2020 (in bcm/y): Power of siberia (opened in 2019), 4.10; Nord stream 43.79, 59.28 (04.28 over max capacity); blue stream 13.06, 8.76; TurkStream (opened in 2020), 13.51
* Major transit countries in 2016 and 2020 in bcm/y: Ukraine 82.20, 55.90; Kazakhstan 27.67, 22.45; Belarus 41.69, 37.22
* Nord stream 2 to be opened in autumn 2021; max capacity 55 bcm/y (same as Nord stream); in germanys elections this autumn, two probable candidates are against Nord Stream 2. Russia is aware, and is draining gas transports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline and through the Net4Gas pipelines (situated further south of the Yamal-Europe pipeline) to drain german gas reserves, increasing fear over gas and energy outages

&amp;#x200B;

**Discussion:**

* Although Gazproms success greatly depends on gas prices (which are on record highs right now), the companies shares have not reflected on that (yet?); most commodities are sold with futures, meaning that gazprom might not yet have fully capitalized on the high natural gas and oil prices

https://preview.redd.it/q00pxnzsqxi71.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5369908a79e178e1cc04e1b16d8273f1a42199a

*blue – gazprom ADR share price*

*light grey – ttf natural gas price*

*dark grey – brent oil prices*

&amp;#x200B;

* Company development: 
* \-- Compared to global reserves, gazproms % has decreased. Due to increased exploration, which wouldnt be conducted if natural gas wouldnt have a future
* \-- Capital expenditures are high, often critizised; after 2020, capex was cut 20% to cut costs; author didnt look into this too much
* \-- Largest foreign customers: UK decreased due to sanctions, although they actually need gas; netherlands increased natural gas purchases dramatically; China increased purchases from 1.5 to 5 bcm/y from 2019 to 2020; UK decrease is easily compensated by netherlands and chinas increased consumption; with the new soyuz pipeline to china (capacity 50bcm/y), their demand must be exptected internally to increase 5-10 fold

&amp;#x200B;

* Gas reserves &amp; pipelines: 
* \-- fears over storage inventories in europe; there appear to be problems at the Yamal pipeline at the german border (at Mallnow compressor station); however these are fake fears and problems: russia is draining german gas storages by delivering too little gas, thus putting pressure on the new german government to commit to Nord Stream 2
* \-- LNG (liquefied natural gas) seems more attractive as pipeline natural gas becomes more expensive; LNG prices rise in the US; but shipbrokers say LNG tankers have 14 day delays without reservation (for context: for long distance transport, LNG tankers are cheaper than pipelines. But if the pipelines exist already (in this case fully paid by Gazprom), and the customer just pays for the gas, the pipeline gas is cheaper)
* \-- Nord Stream pipeline is over 4 bcm/y over capacity; Nord Stream 2 is planned to be opened in autumn 2021; also, Nord Stream 2 circumvents Ukraine and Poland that caused problems repeatedly in the past (extorted russia &amp; illegaly tapping pipelines)

&amp;#x200B;

* Demand for natural gas generally: 
* \-- Western europe is the dominating gas market for Gazprom, with China picking up demand
* \-- British gas production has decreased
* \-- Netherlands gas production has decreased (Groningen gas field is used up); also pointed at by the largest foreign customers numbers where Netherlands demand is sharply rising
* \-- Other natural gas producers for western europe such as norway, lybia and jordania do not have significant impact

&amp;#x200B;

* EU is performing the „Energiewende“, meaning a drastic CO2-reduction
* \-- Lead to an explosion of CO2-emission certificate prices; currently &gt;50 Eur/ton
* \-- Hard coal (lignite even more so) has double the CO2 emissions compared to gas (per MWh electric produced)
* \-- When the CO2 price level tops 30Eur/ton, gas power plants take over the coal power plants in the so called „merit order“ and run base load
* \-- The german Energiewende (rapid investment in Wind and Solar) compensates the nuclear exit, but nothing more as of now; so the fossil energy is still needed
* \-- The (already put into laws) YoY increasing CO2-charge on e.g. domestic heating market leads to a quick exchange of oil heating towards gas heating (currently western germany has 6-9 months of waiting time in the orderbooks for connection of houses to the local gas grid system)

&amp;#x200B;

* Political aspects: 
* \-- Nord Stream 2 was under immense political pressure both from the US and EU members over fear of increased russian influence; the US critic is of hypocritic nature though, because they want to sell LNG gas via tankers to europe; Nord Stream 2 is almost completed though, and paid for by russia; the argument of russia extorting europe via gas outages is almost non-existent; both of the authors contacts agree that once russia signs a gas&amp;oil contract, they stand with their word. (not like china with their rare earth price fluctuations..) Furthermore, Nord Stream 2 circumvents Ukraine. This is important because Ukraine extorted Russia via pipeline shut-offs and illegally tapping on pipelines; of course the ukrainian security position will worsen because russia is less dependent on them (but this effect is more or less self-inflicted) 
* \-- Yukos: some will remember the politically motivated 2003-2006 Yukos collapse – once a russian oil&amp;gas giant. This scenario is unlikely for Gazprom since CEO Miller is close to Putin, already in place since 2001, and Gazprom is more than 50% state-owned
* \-- Russian cash draining: there are reports that sub-contractors and the state are pulling cash from Gazprom, which reduces profits and dividends; this has to be expected in Russia (also because Russia is in need of foreign currency, especially Euro and USD); however they want to keep the cash-cow growing
* \-- Too big to fail: for both sides, russia and europe, Gazprom is the backbone pillar of energy production; russia will defend it
* \-- Europe wants to lower CO2 output, gas is a good alternative to oil and coal; and Russia does not (yet?) care about global warming, because it enables them to use once permafrosted land in their northern parts – which coincedentally are expected to be rich in gas and other commodities

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions &amp; Positions**

* Gazproms dominating market is western europe and Chinas demand increasing; gas reserves growing faster than production; pipelines working well; record gas prices
* Fundamental european situation:
* \-- UK now net importer, not exporter anymore
* \-- Netherlands Groningen production decreased
* \-- European Energiewende – making Gas a better option than hard coal and lignite because of lower CO2 output
* \-- German renewable Energiewende compensates for nuclear exit, but nothing more
* \-- CO2-charge prices expected to increase; gas heating replacing oil heating
* \-- Nord Stream 2 soon to be opened, cheaper than LNG tanker gas and circumventing Ukraine
* Political aspects: 
* \-- Risks associated with Russian state governance; has to keep governmental budget alive (unpredictable taxes/charges situation); but Russia is a reliable partner, and CEO Miller is close with Putin making a Yukos situation unlikely; subcontractors might be draining some money and high Capex

All in all, Gas demand is expected to grow in the next years; high gas prices and good pipeline capacities outweigh some money draining towards the russian state. The Gazprom story does not end before the EU ends CO2-charges (not under discussion). Next earnings on 31/08, but this is a long play into 2022-2023.

Anyhow, I'm too ugly to work behind the dumpster at Wendy's, so being fresh out of tendies, I embarked on an epic quest to search for work so I could still manage to pay my wife's boyfriend. And afford fresh cum socks.

I lied about everything on my resume, and somehow landed a job as a stock broker at a large financial institution. I you knew me, you would be absolutely dumb-founded that I pulled this off. I'm incredibly unqualified and retarded. My parents and brothers were absolutely mind-fucked that I'd managed to pull this off. My mom cried tears of joy at the news that her one retarded son was finally able to get a job. 

Which brings me to the main point of this post: **companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard are desperate for employees. They're hiring anyone and everyone. Unlicensed on the phones is especially easy to get hired for, and they sponsor you for the series 7 exam to become a broker.** 

**I now get paid $22/hour working from home, jacking off and doing practically nothing.** The phone rings once every 15 or so minutes, and the rest of the time I'm on wallstreetbets, soaking in meme culture and trading on my own account, which is perfectly legal and allowed, as long as I don't front-run our clients. 

I love y'all, so wanted to pass on this beautiful brown nugget of wisdom: **apply at a financial institution like the ones mentioned above, get hired, work from home, and sit back trading the memestocks while getting paid hourly for it.** You also will become a licensed stock broker and learn a fuck-ton about the markets. There is so much to learn. If you're great at being retarded, why not get paid for it? Like the joker says, if you're good at something, never do it for free.

The following is  a breakdown on a trade i took in Pintrest ($PINS) i will attempt to walk through the process step by step as best as i can and will answer any questions about any part of the process in an effort to provide helpful insight to anyone looking to trade Swing style breakouts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[a snippet from the weeks watchlist](https://preview.redd.it/v9jttvregqi71.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceb4e7394da11938fd06c8e57f6bee7b11bf7423)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

$PINS had a huge gap down post earnings (7/30) and has been on the radar ever since. It had setup once before but for a small non event trade. It found it's way on the radar pretty easily as it is a ""name brand"" stock and it's catalyst was ""earnings"" so these are generally easy to get on the list, so there is no special scan to this one. I set and maintained alerts on this name and was interested in a break below the sort of  ""island"" it had setup in price and time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[alert set and entry point](https://preview.redd.it/8i8ubdikfqi71.png?width=1143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0b5d7d3f7caffd54dbaee3185b69b818df34e6)

The stock started a trend and seems to have done me a favor by not cutting back to violently on the daily chart. It did however do me no favors in setting the day's Highs very close to the previous day's high. My trailing stop did not guarantee me a profit until it finally gapped down. During this time the ATR also contracted by 30% a sign that the interest in this one was waning and i am likely in the last move in this name for a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7mc8rzcpgqi71.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87adad0d9f95db6a782f76446f27f84366993a7e

The market this week did have some big surges, but in terms of $PINS it seemed there were no bulls excited about this one and it continued to show weakness.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elhsqwmchqi71.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=253414e45eb35f8edd3fc00636db59af5b6588b4

on 8/19 i finally had a chance to get aggressive with my trail. The $SPY gave a gap down of about an ATR and i tightened up all the stops on my shorts to protect in the event of a bounce. In the below screen cap you can see that it gapped into an uptrend line that stretches back to march. In my data i have found these points add up to a potential reversal for my trades and my response is to ""continue to bet on my team, but not to let them cost me money""

&amp;#x200B;

The result of this trade was 2R. I was unrealized over 3R at one point. By looking at the daily chart its actually surprising considering the low action and slow movement. I feel the interesting part of this trade is the concept of patience, discipline and the action of ""switching gears. Allowing the stock to do the work. The changing from a passive observer in the first few bars to an aggressive participant on the final day where i took my profit.

Now that we’ve established this we can continue with what I think might be happening with the Elvish anal stock. 

As were all aware now, PLTR is buying a shit ton of gold and trying except digital currency as well, this is believed to be to hedge against the “Black Swan” event. For anyone unaware this is just any major event that is unexpected, a lot of people see this as a market crash. 

Somewhat irrelevant to the post, but if there is a crash I imagine another huge inflow of buying will take place proving my theory that stocks only go up. Who dosent buy the dip, only bitches. 

Anyway, recently PLTR has been said to be able to use its services to accurately predict things that have not even happened yet, this is super bullish for PLTR and could add so much value to their product. 

If this is true, Palantir may have predicted a near term market crash.

Arrr matey! Are you ready to begin plundering the high seas with your favourite Israeli shipping company?

$ZIM - ZIM Integrated Shipping Services this week they released their Q2 financials. It was a monster beat. $7.40 eps against $6.05 eps consensus. ZIM reported net income of $888 million for Q2 2021 compared to $25 million in Q2 2020.

Now let's think about this for a second.  They currently have a $4.8billion market cap.  They paid off all their debt and had $650mil net income last quarter and Q2 $888 million. They've put down $1.4B in net profit this year and we're only halfway through the year.

  
Surely this can't continue.. Shipping is going to normalize soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong.  Have fun getting your 2021 Christmas presents in 2022.  You've probably been hearing about it for 6 months now.  Shipping prices are through the roof.  Shipping companies are the most profitable they've ever been? Companies are abandoning containers after finding out the shipping costs are more than the net value of the goods within them. How long can this really last? The rates must be coming down..

Wrong. When you started hearing about the insanity of shipping prices it was probably around June.  Even Biden came out and said it was unfair that they were making so much money and he would do something about it (narrator: he didn't).  Okay, 2nd quarter in a row with record results, but surely their guidance must have been poor?

Holy shit! Doubling their guidance. The stock must be exploding!! Nope. ZIM has been in steady decline since releasing the results -- even with a $2 dividend with an ex-dividend Tuesday next week. Probably the most undervalued company on the stock market today. Why aren't the institutions interested in it?  Well, they are.

LUMN is currently trading very close to book value at between $11-12 per share as of time of writing, with earnings per share averaging about $0.40-0.50 per quarter, excluding Q4 where they took a $2 Billion Goodwill impairment. They currently pay a $0.25/share quarterly dividend, for a yield of about 8.5%. The next EX-div is on August 30.

Recently LUMN announced 2 sales consisting of legacy/low-growth assets that make up approximately 20% of their $8.4-8.6B annual EBIDTA. They are giving up $1.7 Billion in EBIDTA for approximately $10.2 Billion in cash. However, if you count the $1.4 Debt that the buyer is taking on, it's effectively $11.6 Billion.

In theory, LUMN could take this $10.2 Billion in proceeds and pay out about $9 per share, covering 75% of the value of the shares, while still remaining profitable with their remaining 80% of EBIDTA and covering their $0.25/quarter dividend.

However, Storey believes the most effective use of this capital is to invest in high-growth Fiber assets, which should grow future earnings, as well as a $1 Billion buyback program over the next 2 years in which the company will be buying shares at a discount to intrinsic value.

Currently the biggest risk LUMN faces has been their approximately $30 Billion in debt and slowly declining revenue, which is the reason the shares are trading at such a low valuation. However, they have been making a lot of progress in both paying down debt and financing it at lower rates the past couple years. In addition, the asset sale consists of their legacy assets, and they intend to focus on growth after the sale.


**Technicals**

LUMN is currently very heavily shorted, with about 10.7 days of trading to cover.  https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LUMN/short-interest/

Last time LUMN saw this level of short interest back in January, where the price temporarily shot up to about $16 during a short squeeze.

For comparison, AMC has just 0.5 days to cover.

LUMN could be due for a short squeeze if the right conditions align.

In addition to the upside, the buyback program should provide some regular price support as the Company seeks good opportunities to buy back shares at a discount.

I really hate averaging UP in general, but earnings and market underreaction made me break that rule.

* Direct advertising sales of $4.4 million compared to direct advertising sales of $0.6 million in Q2 2020 **(700%)**
* The Company’s common shares commenced trading on the Nasdaq **(Hey USA, I hear you like spending money on Stonks)**
* Raised gross proceeds of $60.1 million (USD$49.5 million) in a public offering **(60 million on a company this small does not work at all, unless that investor sees 5-10x returns possible)**
* Completed acquisitions of popular web properties Tabstats and Icy Veins
* Paid subscribers of approximately 155,000 as at June 30, 2021, as compared to approximately 111,000 subscribers as at June 30, 2020 **(155,000 PAID subscribers already is huge, 40% growth year over year)**
* Net and comprehensive loss of $12.8 million, or $0.11 on a per common share basis
* Esports division, Luminosity Gaming, ranked as the most watched team on Twitch for each month of the second quarter **(One of if not the largest Esports teams in the World)**

Look I know everyone is always saying ""Homeless or Lambo"" but if you want to make money and not go bankrupt you can't realistically go all in on short-term options plays and shit companies. I'm seeing a lot of 100% loss posts lately and it's really sad. People come to this sub thinking they are going to get rich quick and it rarely happens. The people you see here that risked their entire portfolio on something and it worked out are the epitome of survivorship bias. Think about all the other people who are here who lurk and keep losing money on trade after trade. 99% of people aren't going to post loss porn out of sheer embarrassment. 

Don't risk more than 5% of your portfolio on any one trade or position. Obviously there are caveats with this one and everyone's risk tolerance is different but **DON'T BE AN IDIOT BY TRYING TO BE A GENIUS.**

I have blown up accounts because of my ego and thinking ""IT LITERALLY CAN'T GO TITS UP"". Last year I bought short dated Roku options because I thought the market wasn't taking into account people having to stay inside and not having much else to do but watch TV. The calls expired worthless and I sold about 90% of the shares I owned or else I was going to get a margin call. If I had just held the shares and sold covered calls I probably would have quadrupled my account.

TLDR: 

\- Don't risk 100% on a trade EVER.

\- Don't blow up your account on short dated options. 

\- If you have strong conviction on something hold the shares or buy LEAPS

Keeping in mind that a lower percentage change and lower deviation from the estimation is better in this context, the following are the YoY CPI data + the estimations:

USD: 5.4% (Est: 5.3%)
CAD: 3.7% (Est: 3.4%)
GBP: 3.8% (Est: 3.6%)

Now here is the Eurozone and AUD

EUR: 0.7% (Est: 0.7%)
AUD: 0.5% (Est: 0.5%)

Not only is the inflation rate far lower, but the estimations are accurate, meaning all the CPI were expected and indicative of stability. Last week when the US CPI data listed above was released, it caused a sharp rise in EUR/USD as the USD value keeps getting lower.

https://twitter.com/crystalzurn/status/1415302358603546631?s=21

As of now, the USD is inflating at a rate comparable to 2008, which explains the record high cost of living and booming house prices. To add to this, the US government is spending like crazy and not making up for it in taxes, meaning they’re spending money they don’t have (printing money). It was just yesterday that an extra US$500m was authorised for Afghan refugee relocation funding, and the recent house infrastructure and public service spending has been through the roof, causing the US debt to vertically flatline. There is no such spending in the Eurozone or Australia. Could these (especially the Euro) be potential hedges against the USD within the next few years if spending continues at the same rate?

Lets get it on!!! Welcome ya bunch of filthy degenerates. I have in my painstakingly long research come across a company that everyone is sure to love for all the right reasons. Raise your hands if you turn off the television when there's a fight during a sports event (\**crickets\*)*. Unless your name is Cletis and you are the product of seven generations of inbreeding, chances are that you tune in more when there's a fight going on than you would for any sports event. Now let me add to this enticing recipe another layer, women. Not salivating yet? ok, fine, women fighting.

I know what you guys are thinking, ""But Prest, our lord and savior Benjamin Graham advised us not to invest in companies that haven’t had a 20 year record of dividend payments.” Fear not, for $EDR (I will be referring to the Ultimate Fighting Championship as $EDR from here on out) has been around since the 90's and has a proven track record of continual growth year after year. It all started in the jungle of Botswana in the year 1982 when you mother and I first met.... oh wait, sorry wrong story.

The year was 1993; a struggling new company called the Ultimate Fighting Championship was a tiny unsanctioned mixed martial arts organization on the cusp of bankruptcy. Cage fighting was not something people were accustomed to watching at that time. The closest thing to it was boxing, but boxing was a sport on the decline. Gone are the days of Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, now you have boxers represented by different promotions each with their own agendas and rules for how and when their fighters will fight.

This is why it took so long for the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight to occur. And what did we get when that fight finally happened? An absolute snooze fest of two fighters point fighting and putting the crowd to sleep. Some people paid top dollar to watch that card, some upwards of $100 for the pay-per-view (luckily, I found my neighbors credit card on the pavement so I paid nothing).

&amp;#x200B;

[Khabib Nurmagomedov: “Why you no buy $EDR? you know its great investment”  ](https://preview.redd.it/5bgan924a4i71.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d07d6b9b67921e4adcb92454c487f38ccdd9fae3)

Enter $EDR; all the top fighters in the world fighting under the same promotion with none of the politics that boxing brings with it. Now here's the kicker, the fighters don't get paid what they should and are bound by an iron clad contract. These contracts are tighter than the pre-nup Jeff Bezos' new wife is going to have to sign.

The fighters are not allowed to fight under any other banner and must obtain consent from $EDR if they want to do anything else that may harm their ability to fight. Now I know some of you have the attention spans of gold fish so I’m going to break down the rest of this DD into four categories:

**1.** **Competition? What’s that?**

**2.** **Papa White**

**3.** **Fighter pay or lack thereof**

**4.** **Five letters G-R-O-W-T-H**

**1)** **Competition? What’s that?**

$EDR has no competition. There are other promotions out there but none of them come in as a close second. **No one tunes in to watch Bellator instead of watching the $EDR.** $EDR is like your wife, she’s reliable, she’s not going anywhere and even though she has a boyfriend neither of you have any illusions of separating.

Enter your side piece, Bellator, you give her attention only when your lady isn’t around. You text her at times “I love you baby” or “You’re so beautiful,” anything to give her that false sense of hope that you might actually care about who she is as a person, LMAO. Not happening Bellator, I thoroughly enjoy our times in the back seat of the car but what I already see of you is all I ever want to see of you.

“But Prest, what happens if you run into your side piece while you’re with your lady?” Exactly the same thing that happens when Bellator comes on at the same time $EDR is on, at that moment you’ve never heard of Bellator and act completely oblivious.

In the early days of $EDR, the fighting landscape was very different than what it is today. All of the best fighters in the world were spread out on different continents and belonged to different promotions. Promotions such as Strikeforce, Pride Fighting Championship and the WEC were all great standard bearers for the sport in the early days.

$EDR bought out all of these organizations. Their fighters were (for the most part) absorbed into the $EDR, which now houses the greatest concentration of world class mixed martial artists in the world.

**2) Papa White**

**No one person has had more of an impact on the sport than $EDR President Dana White.** Often brash and speaking straight from the gut, Dana White is the reason why this once struggling company is now valued at over $10 billion. The role of management speaks a great deal about how a company is guided and its future aspirations. First and foremost, Dana is an avid fight fan, you can see his shiny bald head seated cage side at almost every event. His name is synonymous with $EDR, which is why when Endeavor purchased the company, it insisted Dana White remain as the promotions president.

Hate him or love him, the MMA community acknowledges that the sport would not be where it is today without Dana. I believe this kind of work ethic cannot be fostered and can only exist in someone that is truly passionate about their work.

When asked recently about his plans for retirement, Dana stated “*I love this sport, and* *I love this company. I love all the people that I’m working with every day.* *I can’t imagine doing anything else.*”

&amp;#x200B;

[“Fight of the Night goes to Jon Jones, he gets a 15&amp;#37; off coupon”](https://preview.redd.it/ryyy44kaa4i71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6f9f3688de5af7a506f9738d4f661897e1933c9)

  

**3) Fighter pay or lack thereof**

Fighter pay is not a subject the promotion likes to discuss. **A large majority of the revenue generated by $EDR goes directly to the promotion and not to the fighters.** Although the **fighters are signed as** **independent contractors**, many restrictions are placed on them that prevent them from achieving their full earnings potential. Fighters are not represented by any union so there are no collective bargaining agreements to help them strengthen their position during negotiations.

This is the reason why I believe $EDR has been so successful and why it will continue to thrive in the future. While other sports pay 50% of their revenue to the athletes, $EDR pays only 15-20%. Simply put, **the $EDR is a money-making machine that is taking advantage of the significant position it holds over the sport as well as the fighters.**

**4)** **Five letters G-R-O-W-T-H**

**Analysts have ignored $EDR**. On Monday, the company blew past earnings because the expectations did not take into account the resiliency with which Dana White continues to push the envelope during the pandemic. The reason $EDR’s guidance was raised and it blew past earnings per share is because the analysts did not think $EDR would be selling out stadiums this early into the reopening.

**My research leads me to conclude that $EDR is the best reopening play in 2021.** The company’s introduction into the market has only seen an economy in which stadiums are closed and public attendance is restricted. **With the reopening of the economy underway, I expect $EDR to blow past earnings for the remainder of the year.** Live gate and attendance will continue to rise for the company and they will beat expectations because the company is new to the market and the **analysts are not familiar with $EDR management.**

During the early days of the pandemic, restrictions were placed on public gatherings. Arenas and stadiums were closed to $EDR events. So the company must have shut down, right? Wrong, $EDR shifted operations to Abu Dhabi and declared that the show must go on; this was a year before the company’s IPO. **Analysts were not looking at the company then and are largely ignoring it now.**

The analysts are not familiar with $EDR management and more specifically Dana White. When asked recently whether the company would be going back to no audience shows if the pandemic once again forces closures of public venues, Dana White replied, “Never, we’ll alternate between Florida, Texas, and Abu Dhabi if we have to.”

TLDR: The Ultimate Fighting Championship ($EDR) is the premier mixed martial arts promotion in the world. It is a highly profitable organization that, unlike other sports organizations, does not pay its fighters an equal share of revenue generated from its business. It is the best reopening play for the remainder of 2021 because analysts are unfamiliar with the work ethic behind $EDR management and more specifically president Dana White. This highly successful business model combined with the position the company holds as a monopoly in the sport, all but ensures that continual growth can be projected from $EDR.

The **prospect for US legalization is uncertain** but I want to point your attention to **one big and seemingly unrelated event: what's happening in Afghanistan**.   


**FACT: Afghanistan is the global top supplier of drugs (incl. cannabis)**  
Afghanistan is the top producer of heroin. More importantly for this DD, Afghanistan is also likely the top producer of illegal cannabis. Picture below (source: UN) ranks it as #2 but is likely an underestimation: much of the illegal cannabis reportedly sourced from Pakistan/Lebanon/Spain/other is actually coming from Afghanistan.

https://preview.redd.it/cbzubmwwa4i71.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a865a0e836cb10b3c8d4113db88a25ca40be177

**THESIS: The US will rather legalize than increase import of illegal cannabis from Talibans**  
With the NATO leaving Afghanistan, drug production is likely going to increase. If the US government takes no action, some of it is likely to flow to the US. This will inevitably put pressure on legalization. **Would the US government prefer its citizens to buy homegrown (and taxed) cannabis, or finance the Taliban regime by buying its cannabis?**

# TLDR: Great time to buy cannabis stocks

What exactly? Up to you, this DD is not about individual companies. For transparency I personally like and own positions in ETFs (MSO) and selected US players both small (e.g. CHALF) and large (e.g. CRLBF). Given this DD, I am now going to increase my positions.

Obviously, no financial advise, just my thoughts, let me know yours!

**Valuation: Undervalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

· With more and more states passing legislation, and making sports betting legal, there is a big opportunity for sports betting and gambling stocks to take advantage of.

o The companies who move the quickest will enjoy a first mover advantage and capture large  
amounts of market share.

· With a large variety of sports betting and gambling stocks in the market, which one is best positioned for large growth, and to become a leader in the National market?

o I believe that this is Penn for many reasons, which will be discussed throughout this analysis.

· $PENN – Penn National Gaming is expanding rapidly and has plans to continue their expansion in the American gaming space. Furthermore, they have numerous macroeconomic factors that they can take advantage of to accelerate their growth.

**Company Overview:**

[Penn National Gamming ($PENN)](https://utradea.com/stocks/PENN) owns and manages several gaming and racing properties, retail sports betting operations, online sports betting operations, and video gaming terminal (VGT) operations.

In February of 2020, Penn National purchased a 36% equity interest in “Barstool Sports Inc.” which is a leading digital sports, entertainment, media, and lifestyle brand. Barstool sports is very popular among the younger demographics and expands Penn’s total market and target demographics. Barstool and Penn entered into an agreement where Barstool will promote Penn’s sportsbook, and iGaming products through the “Barstool Sportsbook” mobile app.

Penn National Gaming looks to continue expanding and evolving their operations in order to become an omni-channel provider of retail/online gaming, and sports betting.

**Investment Information:**

*Macroeconomic Outlook:*

*Sports Betting:*

Since 1992, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) made competitive sports betting illegal in most states. However, in 2018, the PASPA was overturned by the Supreme Court and all states are now allowed to legalize sports betting.

Some states have already passed legislation and have made sports betting egal (and live). These states include Oregon, Nevada, North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.

Additionally, there are some states that have made sports betting legal, however, sports betting operations are not yet live in their state. These states include Washington, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Florida, Maryland, and Connecticut.

Lastly, there are some stated that are in the legislative process of making sports betting legal. These states include Ohio, and Massachusetts.

All of the other states are yet to make a move to legalize sports betting.

The full legalization of sports betting in the 22 aforementioned states have opened new business and expansion opportunities for companies that operate in the gaming space. The companies who integrate into these states, and has the best User Experience, Customer Service, and reach, will be able to take over these states and enjoy a first mover advantage that could benefit them for years, decades, or even centuries.

Furthermore, the state who have legalized sports betting, but are yet to have active sports betting operations also represent a large business/expansion opportunity. These states will not have as much competition out of the gate (as the states that have already fully legalized sports betting). This should help sports betting companies to gain market share quickly and enjoy the first mover advantage.

As a result of the large interest/legalization of sports betting, a research study conducted by Gabelli Securities (in partnership with the US Census Bureau) estimated that the US sports betting industry will grow to $10.1B by 2028, which assumes a CAGR of over 25% (currently the sports betting industry is valued at $2.1B).

The Barstool Sportsbook was created to take advantage of the legalization of sports betting and the large business opportunity that comes with it. Currently, the Barstool Sportsbook is available in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, and Indiana.

Furthermore, the Barstool sportsbook is looking to launch in Virginia (in the next couple of weeks), Arizona (Fall 2021), Maryland (Fall 2021), and maybe even Canada (in 2022, which will be talked about later).

*Retail/Online Gaming:*

The COVID-19 pandemic had two large impacts on the US gambling market. Firstly, the retail gambling market in America suffered due to the pandemic, as many states restricted the use of casino’s due to the lockdown measured that they put in place to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This was catastrophic to many retail casinos and unfortunately caused some of them to close their doors permanently. Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic helped out the online gaming industry greatly. This was due to people converting from retail casinos to online casinos due to the closure of the retail casinos.

However, with many lockdown measures being lifted and many retail casinos re-opening their doors, how will the US retail and online gaming industry perform over the next couple of years?

Some reports are estimating the industry to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% over the next 5 years. This is due to their belief that people will go back to the casinos and revive the retail industry, while the online gaming industry continues to grow.

*Acquisitions:*

*Barstool Sports:*

In February of 2020, Penn National Gaming closed their acquisition of “Barstool Sports”. Penn initially acquired 36% of Barstool for $161.2M and has committed to purchasing an additional 14% of their business for $62M over the next 3 years. The deal would conclude with Penn National Gaming owning 50% of Barstool in Feb 2023 for the purchase price of $223.2M, valuing Barstool at $446.4M.

Part of this acquisition included an exclusive partnership between Barstool Sports and Penn National gaming for up to 40 years. This partnership also allows Penn National to use the Barstool Sports brand to promote their online and retail sports betting, and iGaming products.

In September of 2020 (7 months after the acquisitions) Penn National, in partnership with Barstool Sports, launched the “Barstool Sportsbook” which is a sports betting app that uses the Barstool Sports name, and targets their demographic. The Barstool Sportsbook launched in Pennsylvania in Sept 2021 and has expanded to Michigan in January 2021.

Penn National Gaming believes that their partnership/acquisition of Barstool Sports reflects their strategy of evolution/expansions, to help them meet their goal of becoming the Nations largest gaming operator and omni-channel gaming and betting provider.

*The Score:*

Recently (Aug 5th 2021), Penn National Gaming acquired “Score Media and Gaming”, which is a leading digital media and sports betting technology company. Penn National Gaming acquired 100% of Score, In return for $2B.

This acquisition proves Penn National Gaming’s desire to become the largest player in the industry in a big way, as they have set their sights on an international expansion into Canada. Penn has noted the significant opportunity that Ontario brings to the table and believes that their acquisition can help them to penetrate the Ontarian gaming industry. Ontario would be the 5th largest jurisdiction for gaming in all of North America and contributes largely to the $4+B opportunity that Canada has to offer.

Penn National highlights the ability for Score to seamlessly connect Penn’s sports content and betting operations and help to monetize their highly engaged user base. Penn believes that integrating the Score’s data, analytics, tracking, odds, betting, and content will help them to improve margins. Lastly, Penn National Gaming has an optimistic long-term outlook on the impact that the Score will bring, estimating long-term revenues from this acquisition to reach $900M annually.

Many people have also speculated that the Barstool Sportsbook will be able to integrate into Canadian provinces and territories through this acquisition. If this is Penn’s plan, it shows their level of thought behind their acquisitions, and their exceptional talent for finding synergetic acquisitions.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to find Penn’s WACC through my own WACC models. By inputting the necessary information, I found Penn’s WACC to be 8.87%.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I was able to find the forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years to be 29%. I did this through looking Penn’s forecasted financial performances from analysts, and by looking at Penn’s previous financial performances.

*CAGR (2030):*

Penn simply cannot grow by 29% yearly forever as a result I estimated their CAGR in 2030 to be 5% (which is rather low). I then tapered Penn’s growth by deducting 5 percentage points off of the CAGR yearly until 2029.

*Perpetual Growth (Risk Free Rate):*

I was able to find Penn’s Risk-Free Rate in their SEC 10-K filing, in which they estimated this figure to be 1.55%. This 1.55% was used to forecast their yearly growth after 2030.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s operating expense increase rate to be 20% through taking the average growth rate of their operating expense over the past 5 years.

*Interest Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s interest expense increase rate to be 4.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s depreciation and amortization increase rate to be 6.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s 2020 effective tax rate in their SEC 10-K filing. In 2020, Penn’s tax rate was 19.8%, I used this 19.8% for their tax rate through 2030.

*Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Growth Rate:*

I was able to find the CAPEX increase rate to be 9% through taking Penn’s CAPEX growth rate over the past 5 years.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

I was able to undergo my DCF model by using the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By incorporating this information, I was able to find Penn’s fair value to be $199/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 190%. This valuation is rather high, so I decided to also undergo 3 comparable analyses to see if this valuation persisted.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*P/B:*

By comparing Penn’s P/B ratio to their competitors (found above in the “competition” section of this report), I found Penn’s fair value to be $134/share, which implies an upside of 95%. This valuation is not quite as high, but still indicates that Penn is very undervalued.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $83.06/share, which implies an upside of 21%. This estimate is by far the lowest that I have had thus far, however it still indicates that Penn is undervalued.

*EV/EBITDA:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $90/share, which implies an upside of 32%. This valuation also indicates that Penn is undervalued.

Average Comparable:

I took the average result from the 3 comparable analyses that I underwent. I did this because the results were scattered, and I wanted one clear valuation based off of the comparable analyses. I took a weighted average weighing the P/B comparable at 20% weight, and the EV/Revenue &amp; EV/EBITDA comparable analyses at 40% weight. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $96/share, which implies an upside of 40%.

**Plan:**

My plan for an investment into $PENN – Penn National Gaming, would look something like this.

· Enter into a position into Penn below $70/share

· Sell 50% of my position when $PENN hits $96/share (comparable valuation)

· Sell the remaining 50% when $PENN reaches $148/share (average total valuation)

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, Penn did not have a good financial performance. Tis is de in large part to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on their retail operations. Furthermore, during this time they also acquired Barstool, which also had a negative impact on their overall financial performance. If Penn is not able to bounce back in 2021, despite states re-opening, then investors may start to get worried and liquidate their positions.

· **Share Dilution:** In 2020, Penn suffered from a large amount of share dilution. This was due to their Barstool acquisition, and their share offerings so that they could launch products under the Barstool brand. This dilution is not worrying, as long as this level of dilution is a one-time occurrence, this is because they were using the funds received from the offering to fund projects that would help them to expand and generate more revenues in the future. However, if this level of dilution continues, I would be very worried for the future of their stock price.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Penn’s 202 financial performance was very poor. However, if they are able to bounce back in 2021, they will be able to spark a new sense of hope/optimism in their investors and prove to investors that they are financially healthy. Their earnings report this year are very important to their share price and are something to keep an eye on as an investor.

· **Acquisitions:** Historically, when Penn has acquired companies, their stock price has benefited from the news of the acquisition breaking. This is true when Penn acquired the score, as their share price went up 10% the following trading day. This was also true when Penn acquired Barstool Sports, as their stock price increased by over 10% the following trading day. Penn has stated that they are committed to continuing their growth, so future acquisition may be on the cards, and should help boost the Penn stock.

· **Legalization of Sports Betting:** As more states break the news that they are fully legalizing sports betting and starting operations, or if they are passing legislation to make sports betting legal, Penn will benefit from this news. This is especially true if they announce that they will be expanding their operations to that/those state(s).",wallstreetbets,Sell me this $PENN (Penn National Gaming Analysis),https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p6s2e0/sell_me_this_penn_penn_national_gaming_analysis/

**Company Overview:**

[Penn National Gamming ($PENN)](https://utradea.com/stocks/PENN) owns and manages several gaming and racing properties, retail sports betting operations, online sports betting operations, and video gaming terminal (VGT) operations.

In February of 2020, Penn National purchased a 36% equity interest in “Barstool Sports Inc.” which is a leading digital sports, entertainment, media, and lifestyle brand. Barstool sports is very popular among the younger demographics and expands Penn’s total market and target demographics. Barstool and Penn entered into an agreement where Barstool will promote Penn’s sportsbook, and iGaming products through the “Barstool Sportsbook” mobile app.

Penn National Gaming looks to continue expanding and evolving their operations in order to become an omni-channel provider of retail/online gaming, and sports betting.

**Investment Information:**

*Macroeconomic Outlook:*

*Sports Betting:*

Since 1992, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) made competitive sports betting illegal in most states. However, in 2018, the PASPA was overturned by the Supreme Court and all states are now allowed to legalize sports betting.

Some states have already passed legislation and have made sports betting egal (and live). These states include Oregon, Nevada, North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.

Additionally, there are some states that have made sports betting legal, however, sports betting operations are not yet live in their state. These states include Washington, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Florida, Maryland, and Connecticut.

Lastly, there are some stated that are in the legislative process of making sports betting legal. These states include Ohio, and Massachusetts.

All of the other states are yet to make a move to legalize sports betting.

The full legalization of sports betting in the 22 aforementioned states have opened new business and expansion opportunities for companies that operate in the gaming space. The companies who integrate into these states, and has the best User Experience, Customer Service, and reach, will be able to take over these states and enjoy a first mover advantage that could benefit them for years, decades, or even centuries.

Furthermore, the state who have legalized sports betting, but are yet to have active sports betting operations also represent a large business/expansion opportunity. These states will not have as much competition out of the gate (as the states that have already fully legalized sports betting). This should help sports betting companies to gain market share quickly and enjoy the first mover advantage.

As a result of the large interest/legalization of sports betting, a research study conducted by Gabelli Securities (in partnership with the US Census Bureau) estimated that the US sports betting industry will grow to $10.1B by 2028, which assumes a CAGR of over 25% (currently the sports betting industry is valued at $2.1B).

The Barstool Sportsbook was created to take advantage of the legalization of sports betting and the large business opportunity that comes with it. Currently, the Barstool Sportsbook is available in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, and Indiana.

Furthermore, the Barstool sportsbook is looking to launch in Virginia (in the next couple of weeks), Arizona (Fall 2021), Maryland (Fall 2021), and maybe even Canada (in 2022, which will be talked about later).

*Retail/Online Gaming:*

The COVID-19 pandemic had two large impacts on the US gambling market. Firstly, the retail gambling market in America suffered due to the pandemic, as many states restricted the use of casino’s due to the lockdown measured that they put in place to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This was catastrophic to many retail casinos and unfortunately caused some of them to close their doors permanently. Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic helped out the online gaming industry greatly. This was due to people converting from retail casinos to online casinos due to the closure of the retail casinos.

However, with many lockdown measures being lifted and many retail casinos re-opening their doors, how will the US retail and online gaming industry perform over the next couple of years?

Some reports are estimating the industry to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% over the next 5 years. This is due to their belief that people will go back to the casinos and revive the retail industry, while the online gaming industry continues to grow.

*Acquisitions:*

*Barstool Sports:*

In February of 2020, Penn National Gaming closed their acquisition of “Barstool Sports”. Penn initially acquired 36% of Barstool for $161.2M and has committed to purchasing an additional 14% of their business for $62M over the next 3 years. The deal would conclude with Penn National Gaming owning 50% of Barstool in Feb 2023 for the purchase price of $223.2M, valuing Barstool at $446.4M.

Part of this acquisition included an exclusive partnership between Barstool Sports and Penn National gaming for up to 40 years. This partnership also allows Penn National to use the Barstool Sports brand to promote their online and retail sports betting, and iGaming products.

In September of 2020 (7 months after the acquisitions) Penn National, in partnership with Barstool Sports, launched the “Barstool Sportsbook” which is a sports betting app that uses the Barstool Sports name, and targets their demographic. The Barstool Sportsbook launched in Pennsylvania in Sept 2021 and has expanded to Michigan in January 2021.

Penn National Gaming believes that their partnership/acquisition of Barstool Sports reflects their strategy of evolution/expansions, to help them meet their goal of becoming the Nations largest gaming operator and omni-channel gaming and betting provider.

*The Score:*

Recently (Aug 5th 2021), Penn National Gaming acquired “Score Media and Gaming”, which is a leading digital media and sports betting technology company. Penn National Gaming acquired 100% of Score, In return for $2B.

This acquisition proves Penn National Gaming’s desire to become the largest player in the industry in a big way, as they have set their sights on an international expansion into Canada. Penn has noted the significant opportunity that Ontario brings to the table and believes that their acquisition can help them to penetrate the Ontarian gaming industry. Ontario would be the 5th largest jurisdiction for gaming in all of North America and contributes largely to the $4+B opportunity that Canada has to offer.

Penn National highlights the ability for Score to seamlessly connect Penn’s sports content and betting operations and help to monetize their highly engaged user base. Penn believes that integrating the Score’s data, analytics, tracking, odds, betting, and content will help them to improve margins. Lastly, Penn National Gaming has an optimistic long-term outlook on the impact that the Score will bring, estimating long-term revenues from this acquisition to reach $900M annually.

Many people have also speculated that the Barstool Sportsbook will be able to integrate into Canadian provinces and territories through this acquisition. If this is Penn’s plan, it shows their level of thought behind their acquisitions, and their exceptional talent for finding synergetic acquisitions.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to find Penn’s WACC through my own WACC models. By inputting the necessary information, I found Penn’s WACC to be 8.87%.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I was able to find the forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years to be 29%. I did this through looking Penn’s forecasted financial performances from analysts, and by looking at Penn’s previous financial performances.

*CAGR (2030):*

Penn simply cannot grow by 29% yearly forever as a result I estimated their CAGR in 2030 to be 5% (which is rather low). I then tapered Penn’s growth by deducting 5 percentage points off of the CAGR yearly until 2029.

*Perpetual Growth (Risk Free Rate):*

I was able to find Penn’s Risk-Free Rate in their SEC 10-K filing, in which they estimated this figure to be 1.55%. This 1.55% was used to forecast their yearly growth after 2030.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s operating expense increase rate to be 20% through taking the average growth rate of their operating expense over the past 5 years.

*Interest Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s interest expense increase rate to be 4.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s depreciation and amortization increase rate to be 6.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s 2020 effective tax rate in their SEC 10-K filing. In 2020, Penn’s tax rate was 19.8%, I used this 19.8% for their tax rate through 2030.

*Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Growth Rate:*

I was able to find the CAPEX increase rate to be 9% through taking Penn’s CAPEX growth rate over the past 5 years.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

I was able to undergo my DCF model by using the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By incorporating this information, I was able to find Penn’s fair value to be $199/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 190%. This valuation is rather high, so I decided to also undergo 3 comparable analyses to see if this valuation persisted.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*P/B:*

By comparing Penn’s P/B ratio to their competitors (found above in the “competition” section of this report), I found Penn’s fair value to be $134/share, which implies an upside of 95%. This valuation is not quite as high, but still indicates that Penn is very undervalued.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $83.06/share, which implies an upside of 21%. This estimate is by far the lowest that I have had thus far, however it still indicates that Penn is undervalued.

*EV/EBITDA:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $90/share, which implies an upside of 32%. This valuation also indicates that Penn is undervalued.

Average Comparable:

I took the average result from the 3 comparable analyses that I underwent. I did this because the results were scattered, and I wanted one clear valuation based off of the comparable analyses. I took a weighted average weighing the P/B comparable at 20% weight, and the EV/Revenue &amp; EV/EBITDA comparable analyses at 40% weight. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $96/share, which implies an upside of 40%.

**Plan:**

My plan for an investment into $PENN – Penn National Gaming, would look something like this.

· Enter into a position into Penn below $70/share

· Sell 50% of my position when $PENN hits $96/share (comparable valuation)

· Sell the remaining 50% when $PENN reaches $148/share (average total valuation)

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, Penn did not have a good financial performance. Tis is de in large part to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on their retail operations. Furthermore, during this time they also acquired Barstool, which also had a negative impact on their overall financial performance. If Penn is not able to bounce back in 2021, despite states re-opening, then investors may start to get worried and liquidate their positions.

· **Share Dilution:** In 2020, Penn suffered from a large amount of share dilution. This was due to their Barstool acquisition, and their share offerings so that they could launch products under the Barstool brand. This dilution is not worrying, as long as this level of dilution is a one-time occurrence, this is because they were using the funds received from the offering to fund projects that would help them to expand and generate more revenues in the future. However, if this level of dilution continues, I would be very worried for the future of their stock price.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Penn’s 202 financial performance was very poor. However, if they are able to bounce back in 2021, they will be able to spark a new sense of hope/optimism in their investors and prove to investors that they are financially healthy. Their earnings report this year are very important to their share price and are something to keep an eye on as an investor.

· **Acquisitions:** Historically, when Penn has acquired companies, their stock price has benefited from the news of the acquisition breaking. This is true when Penn acquired the score, as their share price went up 10% the following trading day. This was also true when Penn acquired Barstool Sports, as their stock price increased by over 10% the following trading day.

*CAGR (2030):*

Penn simply cannot grow by 29% yearly forever as a result I estimated their CAGR in 2030 to be 5% (which is rather low). I then tapered Penn’s growth by deducting 5 percentage points off of the CAGR yearly until 2029.

*Perpetual Growth (Risk Free Rate):*

I was able to find Penn’s Risk-Free Rate in their SEC 10-K filing, in which they estimated this figure to be 1.55%. This 1.55% was used to forecast their yearly growth after 2030.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s operating expense increase rate to be 20% through taking the average growth rate of their operating expense over the past 5 years.

*Interest Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s interest expense increase rate to be 4.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s depreciation and amortization increase rate to be 6.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s 2020 effective tax rate in their SEC 10-K filing. In 2020, Penn’s tax rate was 19.8%, I used this 19.8% for their tax rate through 2030.

*Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Growth Rate:*

I was able to find the CAPEX increase rate to be 9% through taking Penn’s CAPEX growth rate over the past 5 years.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

I was able to undergo my DCF model by using the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By incorporating this information, I was able to find Penn’s fair value to be $199/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 190%. This valuation is rather high, so I decided to also undergo 3 comparable analyses to see if this valuation persisted.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*P/B:*

By comparing Penn’s P/B ratio to their competitors (found above in the “competition” section of this report), I found Penn’s fair value to be $134/share, which implies an upside of 95%. This valuation is not quite as high, but still indicates that Penn is very undervalued.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $83.06/share, which implies an upside of 21%. This estimate is by far the lowest that I have had thus far, however it still indicates that Penn is undervalued.

*EV/EBITDA:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $90/share, which implies an upside of 32%. This valuation also indicates that Penn is undervalued.

Average Comparable:

I took the average result from the 3 comparable analyses that I underwent. I did this because the results were scattered, and I wanted one clear valuation based off of the comparable analyses. I took a weighted average weighing the P/B comparable at 20% weight, and the EV/Revenue &amp; EV/EBITDA comparable analyses at 40% weight. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $96/share, which implies an upside of 40%.

**Plan:**

My plan for an investment into $PENN – Penn National Gaming, would look something like this.

· Enter into a position into Penn below $70/share

· Sell 50% of my position when $PENN hits $96/share (comparable valuation)

· Sell the remaining 50% when $PENN reaches $148/share (average total valuation)

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, Penn did not have a good financial performance. Tis is de in large part to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on their retail operations. Furthermore, during this time they also acquired Barstool, which also had a negative impact on their overall financial performance. If Penn is not able to bounce back in 2021, despite states re-opening, then investors may start to get worried and liquidate their positions.

· **Share Dilution:** In 2020, Penn suffered from a large amount of share dilution. This was due to their Barstool acquisition, and their share offerings so that they could launch products under the Barstool brand. This dilution is not worrying, as long as this level of dilution is a one-time occurrence, this is because they were using the funds received from the offering to fund projects that would help them to expand and generate more revenues in the future. However, if this level of dilution continues, I would be very worried for the future of their stock price.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Penn’s 202 financial performance was very poor. However, if they are able to bounce back in 2021, they will be able to spark a new sense of hope/optimism in their investors and prove to investors that they are financially healthy. Their earnings report this year are very important to their share price and are something to keep an eye on as an investor.

· **Acquisitions:** Historically, when Penn has acquired companies, their stock price has benefited from the news of the acquisition breaking. This is true when Penn acquired the score, as their share price went up 10% the following trading day. This was also true when Penn acquired Barstool Sports, as their stock price increased by over 10% the following trading day. Penn has stated that they are committed to continuing their growth, so future acquisition may be on the cards, and should help boost the Penn stock.

· **Legalization of Sports Betting:** As more states break the news that they are fully legalizing sports betting and starting operations, or if they are passing legislation to make sports betting legal, Penn will benefit from this news. This is especially true if they announce that they will be expanding their operations to that/those state(s).",wallstreetbets,Sell me this $PENN (Penn National Gaming Analysis),https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p6s7ar/sell_me_this_penn_penn_national_gaming_analysis/

My reasons to yolo on $QELL. I see so much potential. Am I missing something?

1. First mover advantage on regulation (FAA, EASA) and commercial availability. Solid plans for starting commercial flights in 2024. Already sold $1 Billion worth of aircrafts.
2. Designed to overcome barriers for adoption. The main barriers for eVTOL projects and reasons they never took off are: battery technology, noise in urban areas, cost-per-mile, capacity scalability. The design was engineered to overcome exactly these barriers.
3. Access to short and long distance routes with 155 miles range
4. Well-funded and competent R&amp;D: Ducted Electric Vectored Thrust (DEVT) major advantages over open propeller eVTOL
	• Lower noise, lower vibration (smoother ride)
	• Safer (blade loss containment)
	• Larger aircraft with more payload
	• Scalable (higher revenue potential per jet)
5. Compliant with current FAA regulations
6. Ability to scale technology for higher capacity planes without larger wingspan or higher noise. Current designs are 5 and 7 seat planes, but could be up to 16 passengers in the future with same wingspan.
7. Lilium will be listed on NASDAQ through a merger with Qell Acquisition Corp. (SPAC). There’ll be a Meeting to vote on business combination on 9/10.

  As today Nvidia will present their fundamentals for Q2 2021, we expect a significantly grow in earnings, most likely the expectations will be crushed, as AMD did 3 weeks ago.

Corona\`s main economic impact is the increased need of electronic chips especially high computing power like GPU.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics.

Nvidia as the current market leader in the area of GPU is expanding in all diffrent kinds of business not only gaming but as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, big data and/or the greater use of data through 5G, which is probably leading to exponential growth in those young markets.

Nvidia spent 3.92 billion U.S. dollars on research and development in their 2021 fiscal year, an increase from the 2.83 billion U.S. dollars that was spent  on R&amp;D in 2020.  

Nvidia is not only a good bet in going short, but will probably going upwards in mid and especially in long term.

Since I am so confident in this play, I will not sell ANY of my positions for AT LEAST 2 weeks! (besides positions that expire before then) 

If you have an IQ above room temperature, I created a more in-depth DD for you to look at ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5fq2n/pubmatic\_extended\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5fq2n/pubmatic_extended_dd/)). But since most of you on this site have an attention-span worse than a goldfish, here is the simplified version of the play:

&amp;#x200B;

You pea brained apes probably came here to fuck up some short sellers, rumor has it that this stock is the second most shorted on the entire market (at around 39% SI), but there is so much more to this company than just that

Pubmatic is an online advertising company. They are the middle man between sellers of ad-space, advertisers, and consumers. What makes them unique is their method of using AI to put ad-spaces into small ‘nodes’ of similar content and then having those same algorithms match content to ad-space. This has worked super well as they are a profitable company growing 88% y/y

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me introduce to you the REAL fun! Short sellers (who are potentially more retarded than you retards) have shorted this well run, profitable company into the ground. PUBM is now the second most shorted stock on the ENTIRE MARKET. 

https://preview.redd.it/frarazel3xh71.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9518d0bd99523f0db8a1545a2ed5f5c66322df96

This fact does not even get into the short’s biggest fuck-up, not realizing how low liquidity is on this stock. Let me explain...

There are both class A and class B shares, class B shares are most of the shares issued pre-IPO. Any B share has 10 times the voting power of class A shares. But get this, once a B share is sold, it turns into an A share. So no insider is ever gonna fuckin sell their B shares unless they want no power in the company. 

There are around 11M class A shares and 38M class B shares, so a majority of the shares are basically locked up. 

Because of this, there is NOT even enough class A shares for all shorts to get if they wanted to cover. Insiders would have to sacrifice their power in the company to save the people who are LITERALLY betting on their company failing

If we exclude B shares, the short interest is around 177.5%! Realistically some insiders would sell, but still that number puts into perspective of how FUCKED the shorts really are

Additionally, the option chains are super fuckin bullish even before you degenerates got hold of them. The C/P ratio is at around 3, and the open interest on 40$ C’s is insane. If we get this stock to 40$, MM’s would have to purchase up to 450,000 shares! This stock is not only primed for a short squeeze, but also a gamma squeeze!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to profit:**

Literally almost anything works

If you wanna be a boomer r/investor, go buy some shares, that helps lower the float

If you wanna be a complete degen and yolo your life savings, go buy some calls and watch the money flow in. Every single ITM option forces MM’s to buy 100 shares, so options will send this to the fucking MOON

Alright folks! I believe Aterian ($ATER) is an interesting stock for a 12-18 months play and would like to share my findings about the company so far with you. I believe the stock currently has an assymetrical risk/reward profile.

Of course, this is not investment advice and you should do your own due dilligence. Disclaimer: I am long. Now, let's get into it.

**Aterian, a tech enabled Consumer Product Company**That still doesn't say jack, here's a rundown of what the company does:

* [Aterian](https://www.aterian.io/) sells unbranded consumer products such as ACs, dehumidifiers, refrigerators, dishwashers, etc. on marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, etc. **Many products are (one of) the best ranked in their category**, which makes it **extremely difficult to compete with** these products.
* The **company is able to launch new products and get them to the #1 position** in their category relatively quickly. They also acquire existing products to grow inorganically (buy and build), more on that later.
* The company has **grown revenues \~70% YoY since 2017 (!).** Revenues were a mere \~$35 mln in 2017 and $186 mln in 2020, with 2021 project revenues around $350 mln.

**Investment thesis**

* The company has **significant organic sales growth**, which is **accelerated by the company's buy-and-build strategy** of e-commerce brands and products. Aterian was one of the first companies to apply this strategy in this niche, and now other companies such as [Thrasio](https://www.thrasio.com/) are doing the same. In case you don't know, buy-and-build is typically used by private equity funds as it offers very attractive returns, because...
* **Buy-and-build M&amp;A creates value** in two ways: **multiple arbitrage and higher margins**. Aterian acquires smaller companies at low multiples (lower than Aterian's) and there is significant cost cutting opportunity after acquisition (i.e. less personnel and back-end integration).
* The company **will become profitable this year**, which enables the company to use its cash flows and debt for M&amp;A instead of diluting stock offerings.
* The share price has dropped significantly, and offering an attractive investment opportunity. It was overvalued earlier this year (at the peak of the run-up), but a $9 share value leads to a \~$300 mln market cap. With 2021 revenues expected at 2021, this implies a **\~0.9 price-to-sales ratio, for a business growing \~70% per year.**
* Despite some short-term uncertainty, there is **significant upside potential in the short to mid term** (12-18 months) due to share price appreciaton and potential shorts that have to cover (more on that in a bit). [The company raised money from institutional investors at $15.00 in June](https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-announces-pricing-40-million-private-placement), so this could be considered a floor. Well-respected analysts put **price targets on Aterian of $42 to $50 in 12-18 months**. These are [Brian Nagel](https://imgur.com/tm8xUlN) with a $50 PT and [Tom Forte](https://imgur.com/UJSanMc) with a $42 PT.

**Lowlights**

* **Potential supply chain issues**. **Container shipping costs have increased** and seem to remain elevated for 2021 and (part of) 2022. The bearish view is that this leads to lower margins and potentially less revenue growth. **The whole market suffers from this**, so this **does not hurt Aterian specifically.** The company seems to have simply raised its prices, which can be observed [here](https://imgur.com/sBGoZFg), [here](https://imgur.com/iQyPOjk), and [here](https://imgur.com/0ZSCsjf). **The supply chain issues could also lead to stock outages**.
* The company has a **high debt** and **required dilutive offerings to finance its growth** so far, but it did [a $40 mln offering in June at $15.00 per share](https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-announces-pricing-40-million-private-placement). This offering provided the company with ample cash to operate and further grow. While the press release is not clear on the exact purpose of the offering, it could be used for working capital, and/or an acquisition and/or to increase the net cash position for the loan from investment banks it is in discussions with. **With $40 mln fresh cash, the company** **should be well-positioned.**

**Highlights**

* **Marketplaces allow unbranded products to thrive**. It's all about reviews &amp; rankings, not brand. With &gt;2K producs, 14 brands and 35+ best sellers it's very difficult to compete - and it's a thriving business, as Amazon revenue from third party sellers [increased 34% in Q2 2021 vs. last year](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-2dcdc6a32/).
* **Company growth is extraordinary with a lot of room to grow still**: **(i) new products, (ii) new channels (other marketplaces and DTC) and (iii) other geographies**. Aterian is now also listing products on Walmart, Wayfair etc.
* **The company has significantly increased their margins earlier this year.** In Q1 2021 they increased gross margins by 14% to 54% and contribution margin by 15% to 13% (from -3%). M&amp;A activity allows the company to cut costs heavily after an acquisition.
* The company has **a healthy pipeline of M&amp;A targets**, [as indicated in their Q1 2021 earnings call.](https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-first-quarter-2021-results) They have **an M&amp;A pipeline of potential targets with TTM net revenue of $613 million and TTM EBITDA of $91 million** (according Q1 earnings). This is **very attractive for its buy-and-build strategy**.
* The **company is in discussions with investment banks to attract cheaper debt** to improve the cost of capital for its accelerated M&amp;A strategy. The cheaper debt and $30 mln EBITDA (expected this year), the company should be finance its buy-and-build strategy in an attractive way.
* The company's developed [AIMEE™](https://www.aterian.io/partner). a tool that enables **customers to scale thousands of SKUs across the world’s largest e-commerce channels**. It **automates marketing and pricing**, increasing the unit economics. AIMEE has only been recently launched, but **it could drive significant future revenues** (there's about 1-2 mln third party sellers on Amazon).

While this could be an attractive opportunity already, company is quite heavily shorted - and some shares on loan will need to be bought back due to Failure-to-Delivers (FTD). This combined could lead to a short term upward momentum. Let's dive into more detail.

**Short term catalyst: tightening short constraints and Failure-to-Delivers**Next week provides for a very interesting set-up: Currently it shows around 20% with borrow fee of 7.6% on Fintel

* **\~4.4mil stock shorted** ([per 15/7](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ater/short-interest) Nasdaq), but [short volume since then was &gt;50%](https://imgur.com/0NGVqA5) \- so probably more now
* **98% utilization rate**[, Fintel indicates there are only 200K shares available](https://imgur.com/ON0QaVc) of a 15.6 mln float
* **Shorting cost starting to increase** (short demand is high / supply is low)
* **Buying pressure as shorters have to buy back their shares,** as +-35 days ago [failure-to-delivers started to happen](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=ATER). In other words, there will be some buying pressure next week.

**Aterian reports earnings on Monday 9th of August before market open**, which I believe is bullish. The **earnings report will likely be a catalyst**, as **the company has +-30% short interest. Possibly shorts want to cover before ER, which would to rapid share price appreciation this week. Next week will likely encounter buying pressure, as shares needs to be bought due to Failure to Delivers +- 30 days ago.**

**All in all, I believe this could be an interesting opportunity but please chime in to share your point of view.**

**EDIT 04/08: The price action of the last couple of days was horrible. However, the number of hedge funds holding $ATER and the shares they own has increased in Q2 \[as per today - still pending some 13Fs\]:**

* Pretty much every single institution has their avg. share prices around $8.50 or more. NNDM is currently trading under $6 - Those holders are going no where before 5x profits.
* 10% short flow - great potential for short squeeze.
* Currently NNMD is valued pretty much to their actual liquidity value
* Which means that their potential to revolutionize the entire industry is not factored in

Alright folks! I believe Aterian ($ATER) is an interesting stock for the a play for the next 12-18 months and would like to share my findings about the company so far with you. I believe the stock currently has an assymetrical risk/reward profile, but looking forward to hearing your point of view.

Of course, this is not investment advice and you should do your own due dilligence. Disclaimer: I am long. Now, let's get into it.

**Aterian, a tech enabled Consumer Product Company**That still doesn't say jack, here's a rundown of what the company does:

* [Aterian](https://www.aterian.io/) sells unbranded consumer products such as ACs, dehumidifiers, refrigerators, dishwashers, etc. on marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, etc. **Many products are (one of) the best ranked in their category**, which makes it **extremely difficult to compete with** these products.
* The **company is able to launch new products and get them to the #1 position** in their category relatively quickly. They also acquire existing products to grow inorganically (buy and build), more on that later.
* The company has **grown revenues \~70% YoY since 2017 (!).** Revenues were a mere \~$35 mln in 2017 and $186 mln in 2020, with 2021 project revenues around $350 mln.

**Investment thesis**

* The company has **significant organic sales growth**, which is **accelerated by the company's buy-and-build strategy** of e-commerce brands and products. Aterian was one of the first companies to apply this strategy in this niche, and now other companies such as Tharsio are doing the same. In case you don't know, buy-and-build is typically used by private equity funds as it offers very attractive returns, because...
* **Buy-and-build M&amp;A creates value** in two ways: **multiple arbitrage and higher margins**. Aterian acquires smaller companies at low multiples (lower than Aterian's) and there is significant cost cutting opportunity after acquisition (i.e. less personnel and back-end integration).
* The company **will become profitable this year**, which enables the company to use its cash flows and debt for M&amp;A instead of diluting stock offerings.
* The share price has dropped significantly, and offering an attractive investment opportunity. It was overvalued earlier this year (at the peak of the run-up), but a $9 share value leads to a \~$300 mln market cap. With 2021 revenues expected at 2021, this implies a **\~0.9 price-to-sales ratio, for a business growing \~70% per year.**
* Despite some short-term uncertainty, there is **significant upside potential in the short to mid term** (12-18 months) due to share price appreciaton and potential shorts that have to cover (more on that in a bit). [The company raised money from institutional investors at $15.00 in June](https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-announces-pricing-40-million-private-placement), so this could be considered a floor. Well-respected analysts put **price targets on Aterian of $42 to $50 in 12-18 months**. These are Brian Nagel with a $50 PT and Tom Forte with a $42 PT.

**Lowlights**

* **Potential supply chain issues**. **Container shipping costs have increased** and seem to remain elevated for 2021 and (part of) 2022. The bearish view is that this leads to lower margins and potentially less revenue growth. **The whole market suffers from this**, so this **does not hurt Aterian specifically.** **The supply chain issues could also lead to stock outages**.
* The company has a **high debt** and **required dilutive offerings to finance its growth** so far, but it did [a $40 mln offering in June at $15.00 per share](https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-announces-pricing-40-million-private-placement). This offering provided the company with ample cash to operate and further grow. While the press release is not clear on the exact purpose of the offering, it could be used for working capital, and/or an acquisition and/or to increase the net cash position for the loan from investment banks it is in discussions with. **With $40 mln fresh cash, the company** **should be well-positioned.**

**Highlights**

* **Marketplaces allow unbranded products to thrive**. It's all about reviews &amp; rankings, not brand. With &gt;2K producs, 14 brands and 35+ best sellers it's very difficult to compete - and it's a thriving business, as Amazon revenue from third party sellers [increased 34% in Q2 2021 vs. last year](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-2dcdc6a32/).
* **Company growth is extraordinary with a lot of room to grow still**: **(i) new products, (ii) new channels (other marketplaces and DTC) and (iii) other geographies**. Aterian is now also listing products on Walmart, Wayfair etc.
* **The company has significantly increased their margins earlier this year.** In Q1 2021 they increased gross margins by 14% to 54% and contribution margin by 15% to 13% (from -3%). M&amp;A activity allows the company to cut costs heavily after an acquisition.
* The company has **a healthy pipeline of M&amp;A targets**, [as indicated in their Q1 2021 earnings call.](https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-first-quarter-2021-results) They have **an M&amp;A pipeline of potential targets with TTM net revenue of $613 million and TTM EBITDA of $91 million** (according Q1 earnings). This is **very attractive for its buy-and-build strategy**.
* The **company is in discussions with investment banks to attract cheaper debt** to improve the cost of capital for its accelerated M&amp;A strategy. The cheaper debt and $30 mln EBITDA (expected this year), the company should be finance its buy-and-build strategy in an attractive way.
* The company's developed [AIMEE™](https://www.aterian.io/partner). a tool that enables **customers to scale thousands of SKUs across the world’s largest e-commerce channels**. It **automates marketing and pricing**, increasing the unit economics. AIMEE has only been recently launched, but **it could drive significant future revenues** (there's about 1-2 mln third party sellers on Amazon).

Hedge funds have also increased their position last year (based on reported thus far - some 13Fs still to be filed ([source](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/mwk)):

Based on 13Fs reported so far, hedge funds have increased their position in Q1 and Q2 2021

While this could be an attractive opportunity already, company is quite heavily shorted - and some shares on loan will need to be bought back due to Failure-to-Delivers (FTD). This combined could lead to a short term upward momentum. Let's dive into more detail.

**Short term catalyst: tightening short constraints and Failure-to-Delivers**Next week provides an interesting set-up. TL;DR:

* **\~4.4mil stock shorted** ([per 15/7](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ater/short-interest) Nasdaq), but - short volume since then was &gt;50%- so probably more now. Borrowing cost is around 7.6% on Fintel data
* **98% utilization rate, - Finteal shows only 350K shares to borrow** of a 15.6 mln float
* **Shorting cost starting to increase** (short demand is high / supply is low)
* **Buying pressure as shorters have to buy back their shares,** as +-35 days ago [failure-to-delivers started to happen](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=ATER). In other words, I believe these have to be bought back next week.

I'm not a TA guy, but I think the chart looks horrible from a TA perspective. The stock has about a $9 floor, though. The company reports earnings on Monday 9th of August before market open. I believe that's a bullish sign, but then there's much more clarity on how things are going.

**All in all, I believe this could be an interesting opportunity but please chime in to share your point of view.**

UPDATE 6-China steps up tech scrutiny with rules over unfair competition, critical data

* Shares of internet platforms fall after draft rules from SAMR
* China has been tackling anti-competitive behaviour, data misuse
* New regulations protecting critical information infrastructure also planned

(Updates with U.S.-listed Chinese stocks)
By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI, Aug 17 (Reuters) - China moved on Tuesday to tighten control of its technology sector, publishing detailed rules aimed at tackling unfair competition and companies' handling of critical data.

Beijing has been firming its grip on internet platforms in recent months, citing the risk of abusing market power to stifle competition, misuse of consumers' information and violation of consumer rights, in a reversal after years of a more laissez-faire approach.

The country issued hefty fines to companies including e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and social media company Tencent Holdings as part of a widening crackdown and has vowed to draft new laws around technology innovation and monopolies. (NEWS)

On Tuesday, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) issued a set of draft regulations banning unfair competition and restricting the use of user data.

New York-listed shares of Alibaba , JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc fell between 2.9% and 3.5% in premarket trading. Tencent-backed online brokerage Futu Holdings slid 7% and was among the most actively traded stocks across U.S. exchanges, while peer UP Fintech Holding slipped 3%.

Tencent Music Entertainment Group shed 3.8% and was set to extend losses for a sixth straight session despite reporting better-than-expected earnings. (NEWS)

""The proposed regulations' specificity evidences a clear set of priorities in setting the 'rules of engagement' for online competition,"" said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina.

""If promulgated, the regulations will likely increase compliance burdens for transaction platforms, including e-commerce marketplaces and shoppable short video apps.""

NO HIJACKING OF TRAFFIC
Internet operators ""must not implement or assist in the implementation of unfair competition on the Internet, disrupt the order of market competition, affect fair transactions in the market,"" the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) wrote in the draft, which is open to public feedback before a Sept. 15 deadline.

Specifically, the regulator stated, business operators should not use data or algorithms to hijack traffic or influence users' choices. They may also not use technical means to illegally capture or use other business operators’ data.

Companies would also be barred from fabricating or spreading misleading information to damage the reputation of competitors and need to stop marketing practices like fake reviews and coupons or ""red envelopes"" - cash incentives - used to entice positive ratings.

Soon after the draft tech rules were published, China's cabinet announced it would also implement regulations on protecting critical information infrastructure operators from Sept. 1.

The State Council said operators must conduct security inspections and risk assessments once a year, and should give priority to purchasing ""secure and credible network products and services,"" marking an elaboration on the landmark Cybersecurity Law that passed in 2017.

The Chinese government has also taken ownership stakes in the domestic entities of social media giants ByteDance and Weibo , Reuters reported on Tuesday citing corporate filings.

Between today and 8/20 we will see some exciting movement on Manganese X Energy Corp.

The company's vision is to supply ethically sourced, more environmentally friendly manganese to the EV and energy storage industries.

They are positioned to be the only mine in North America, and set to release the Preliminary Economic Assessment in the coming quarters.

Battery composition will increase from 10% manganese up to 30% in the coming years as automakers move away from dirty, nasty cobalt. To compound the demand increase, all legacy automakers are now shifting to an electrified production model. This will result in a further 4x demand in the precious battery metal. RIP gasoline.

There are DDs.out there for MN.V (MNXXF is the OTC) with some very delicious connections to TSLA and other battery makers through Dalhousie University c/o Jeff and Roger Dahn.

Just to throw this out there and circle back to the reason for action before August 20th:

The company is spinning out certain graphite assets into a separate company which will trade under the ticket GEL in September. For every 8 MN.V shares you own, you will receive 1 GEL share paid as a distribution. Those holding positions MN.V will be rounding out their positions to the nearest 8. Buy Buy buy.

Cathie Wood's smash-hit active funds collectively bought $139 million in [**Palantir**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/pltr-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) shares on Thursday as the stock shot up as much as 15% on a buoyant sales forecast, Ark Invest revealed in its daily trade disclosures.

All six of Ark's actively managed funds bought Palantir to the tune of 5.6 million shares, including its flagship Ark Innovation ETF, which bought around 2.3 million. Palantir closed at $24.89 on Thursday, giving the buys a total value of $139.4 million - though it wasn't clear exactly when in the day Ark bought.

The purchases indicate Wood thinks the company has considerable upside even given Thursday's run-up. If Wood had bought at Wednesday's closing price, Ark would have paid roughly $14 million less for the positions.

Palantir said it expects third-quarter revenue of $385 million, ahead of analyst estimates for $380 million. It also reported second-quarter earnings per share of $0.04, versus estimates of $0.03.

CNBC first [**reported**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/cathie-wood-loads-up-on-palantir-with-purchases-worth-nearly-140-million.html+) the Palantir buys.

Wood has supported Palantir for months, saying in February that the firm's aggressive investment strategy and reliable public-sector revenue base bode well for the stock.

Hey Retards, I have spent the past week finding the best play to make you rich enough to hire male prostitutes for your wife since you can’t please her

Since I am so confident in this play, I will not sell ANY of my positions for AT LEAST 2 weeks!

If you have an IQ above room temperature, I created a more in-depth DD for you to look at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5fq2n/pubmatic\_extended\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5fq2n/pubmatic_extended_dd/))

But since most of you on this site have an attention-span worse than a goldfish, here is the simplified version of the play:

You pea brained apes probably came here to fuck up some short sellers, rumor has it that this stock is the second most shorted on the entire market (at around 39% SI), but there is so much more to this company than just that

Pubmatic is an online advertising company. They are the middle man between sellers of ad-space, advertisers, and consumers. What makes them unique is their method of using AI to put ad-spaces into small ‘nodes’ of similar content and then having those same algorithms match content to ad-space. This has worked super well as they are a profitable company growing at 88% y/y

Now that we got that boring shit out of the way, let me introduce to you the REAL fun! Short sellers (who are potentially more retarded than you Retards) have shorted this well run, profitable company into the ground. PUBM is now the second most shorted stock on the ENTIRE MARKET.  


*Processing img 6xxj4bm92qh71...*

 This fact does not even get into the short’s biggest fuck-up, not realizing how low liquidity is on this stock. Let me explain...

There are both class A and class B shares, class B shares are most of the shares issued pre-IPO. Any B share has 10 times the voting power of class A shares. But get this, once a B share is sold, it turns into an A share. So no insider is ever gonna fuckin sell their B shares unless they want no power in the company.

There are around 11M class A shares and 38M class B shares, so a majority of the shares are basically locked up.

Because of this, there is NOT even enough class A shares for all shorts to get if they wanted to cover. Insiders would have to sacrifice their power in the company to save the people who are LITERALLY betting on their company failing

If we exclude B shares, the short interest is around 177.5%! Realistically some insiders would sell, but still that number puts into perspective of how FUCKED the shorts really are

Additionally, the option chains are super fuckin bullish even before you degenerates got hold of them. The C/P ratio is at around 3, and the open interest on 40$ C’s is insane. If we get this stock to 40$, MM’s would have to purchase up to 450,000 shares! This stock is not only primed for a short squeeze, but also a gamma squeeze!

**How to profit:**

Literally almost anything works

If you wanna be a boomer [r/investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/investor/), go buy some shares, that helps lower the float

If you wanna be a complete degen and yolo your life savings, go buy some calls and watch the money flow in. Every single ITM option forces MM’s to buy 100 shares, so options will send this to the fucking MOON

Why ContextLogic Stock Crashed Today

What happened 
Shares of ContextLogic dropped 19.8% on Friday after the e-commerce platform reported disappointing second-quarter results. 
So what
ContextLogic's revenue fell 6% year over year to $656 million. That was far below the $723 million in revenue Wall Street had expected. 
The downturn was driven by a 32% plunge in ContextLogic's core marketplace revenue. The company saw a 13% decrease in app installs and a 15% decline in the average time users spent on its platform as more people returned to stores when the economy reopened.
Worse still, while ContextLogic's user engagement fell, its advertising costs rose. Management said that Apple's recent privacy changes to its iOS mobile operating system led marketers to shift their spending to Android-powered devices. In a letter to shareholders, the company stated: 
Ultimately, this drove up competition for advertising bids, restrained our ability to reach more users, and increased advertising costs for Wish since most of our growth marketing has been focused on Android, the preferred device for the majority of our users.
All told, ContextLogic's net loss ballooned to $111 million from $11 million in the year-ago period.
Now what
ContextLogic's financial results are likely to deteriorate further in the third quarter. The company said its quarter-to-date total revenue through July was down roughly 40% as it pulled back on its digital-ad spending while working to improve its operations.

Since 90%+ of my portfolio is tied up in a play, I didn’t plan on posting anything until after. However, some [SKIN calls recently paid off](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/) and now I have money now for a side bet. So I’m going to introduce a stock that caught my eye. But, before I begin I want you all to watch this education video on how Hedge’s take your money:

[The Barclays Trading Strategy that Outperforms the Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pYgz4YlQnE)

Since I didn’t release anything on NEGG until the [last second](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/), and didn’t have the time to write up a DD on SKIN before [the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I wanted to change it up and inject some new blood into the pool. I have a theory that a lot of stocks on this sub are built on the backs of bagholders, so anytime I post a DD I want to make sure the setup is especially juicy and the calls cheap. Loss porn is cool and all, but it's depressing - I’m looking at you [UPST bro](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3mhc0/upst_crash_update_how_to_lose_150k_in_3_days/), [I warned your ass to chill](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1wt77/betting_80k_on_upst_crash_after_earnings/h8hug6f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

This isn’t CLOV, AMC, WKHS, CLNE — **this is PAYA** a stock with juicy profit margins, crazy revenue growth, and an asymmetric gain opportunity in the short term because calls are cheap, with whales already jumping in slapping big dick energy down on OTM calls. 

Eerily, this stock has not been mentioned on reddit or any of the regular places I check for mentions, even though they 1) [murked earnings and raised guidance](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/08/22370953/paya-holdings-clocks-25-revenue-growth-in-q2-lifts-fy21-gross-margin-outlook), 2) [analysts keep upgrading their PTs](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PAYA/price-target/), 3) [announced on Friday a cashless redemption catalyst on Sep 10](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and), and 4) institutions are loaded to the tits with shares **(118%+)**

📷

**This institutional share anomaly** will be deep dived later - but surprise surprise, since the institutions who **own all the shares are investment management firms who generally** buy and hold, the float is illiquid. Since, without an actively traded float there is essentially no float. Lastly as always there is a short angle for extra salt.

When you read this DD remember the video I posted; people are watching  [👀](https://emojipedia.org/eyes/), so take profits this time and cut your losses if you FOMO in at the last second. I wouldn’t be posting or throwing money down on calls unless I had a good amount of conviction that this pays out.

**Here’s the tldr summary for what’s up**

* **Solid financials.** Ex: 52% gross profit margins (Square is 28%) 
* **Near-100% institutional holdings** (equals highly restricted float)
* **Major warrant dilution cancellation** catalyst (Sep 10)
* **Multiple** **major valuations** at a 60% upside. 
* **IV is dirt poor** at 40% .

# Part 1 About + Financials 

PAYA is a payment processor that has done close to $35bn in payments in 2020, projected $40bn in 2021 and is growing at a fast pace. They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.

📷

Paya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest. 

📷

Caption: competitors analyzed: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE

There’s a lot to deep dive into, but it’s solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible. [Their recent Q2 ER presentation](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93) showed off their stellar earnings growth. It’s hard to name other companies with permanent relevancy that have **over a 50% gross profit margin**. 

Couple highlights

* $135mil of cash on hand
* $244mil revenue expected in 2021
* 25% revenue growth year-over-year realized and projected
* 42% gross profit margin growth year-over-year realized and projected

📷

Since the economy has reopened, PAYA’s profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US. 

[BTIG](https://www.investing.com/news/btig-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2439931), [Truist](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21740210/truist-securities-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-buy-rating-announces-price-target-of-15), [Cannacord](https://m.investing.com/news/canaccord-genuity-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2344676), and [Credit Suisse](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20983489/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target-of-1) have all given PAYA bullish targets with an average 56% upside. Meanwhile, institutions have just been pouring into this stock and buying more while increasing price targets. 

# Part 2 Institutional Holdings: +128% 

📷

Okay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can’t hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares. 

**However** **it is very likely that institutions hold near-100% of all shares**. The entire volume over the last 6 weeks since Q2 reporting was only 28 million shares. The largest holder, GTCR didn’t sell a share, Blackrock bought 150% more, and every single other major institution holder that reported for Q2 so far **increased** their positions.

📷

What does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked. **And remember: if nearly all outstanding shares are being held by institutions**, **that means the effective float is tiny**. This is very important in relation to short interest**.** 

Figuring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-

* [PAYA tells us](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93#page=10) there are 121mil shares outstanding in their recent ER. 
* [13Fs/Ds tell us](https://fintel.io/so/us/paya) that most institutions are holding and only small funds are trading in and out. 
* [FINRA tells us](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/paya/short-interest) that ***there are 7.2mil outstanding S***I. 
* [Price tells us](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PAYA/) that only 28mil shares were traded in the last 6 weeks since June 30 Q2 reports have been filed with only a net 2.1mil share sell.

**If nearly all shares are held by institutions,** then obviously the float is highly restricted. Since we know the exact number of shorts via FINRA, we can figure out real short interest in relation to the float at different institutional holding levels.

📷

After all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can’t be named, it’s obvious PAYA’s float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher. **This would correlate to a 60%-118% short percentage of the effective float.**

Additionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in [FTDs with the price bleeding up](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=paya). To me this indicates tight short constraints, and combining with what we already know leads me to the belief that there may be a supply issue. SI doesn’t have to be balls to the wall for it to matter, sometimes supply-side issues are there but not reflected in the raw SI data. 

I guarantee these shorts don’t realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don’t even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won’t end well 

# Part 3 Canceled. Warrant dilution

A lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -**15% share dilution** of current shareholders.

[Surprise](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and). 

Turns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are **forgoing $200 million** to protect share value by buying back their warrants. This is pending a vote due on Sep 10 where they already have 63.5% of “yes” votes. 

For those unfamiliar with the process here, I’ll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term. [As stated in their S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001819881/000121390020035622/fs12020_payaholdings.htm), PAYA originally issued 17.7mil warrants (which would eventually dilute into the stock), however last week [they dropped the news](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and) that they would be calling for a “cashless redemption” of the warrants at a ratio of .26 shares per warrant, and changing the dilution from the long established 17.7mil to 4.6mil. 

This is bullish because 

1. PAYA is saying they don’t need the cash (the 17.7mil warrants exercised would have brought them $204mil) 
2. Instead of the float being diluted by 17.7mil shares, there will now be only 4.6mil shares issued. **This is a positive change of +11% which the market has not priced in.**
3. The warrants don’t have an upward cap, and can be bought as high as wanted in relation to the stock.

📷

# Part 4 The Short and Long Play

**Fair value is** **at least $16.65** based on analyst coverage, warrant cashless redemption, and fundamental growth profit margins [growing at 42% YoY](https://investors.paya.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001819881-21-000035). They provide services that are growing exponentially and will remain in high demand for decades + their stock has received a ridiculous number of valuations all 46% higher than current valuation **before the warrant redemption news hit**. 

There is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.

**9/20 10c @ .60 = 733% returns at $11.33 by Sep 10** 

**9/20 12.5c @ .10 = 2400% returns at $15 by Sep 10**

**11/15 15c @ .15 = 1800% returns at $17.5 in October**

4. He puts down a downpayment of 20%, I pay the other $240k
5. Because of his shit credit, he obviously defaults on his loan. Because this is a mortgage, I get his house
6. I just acquired a 300k house for 80% of the price
7. Instead of auctioning it off like other lenders, I flip the property. New flooring and stuff, gonna spend like $20,000 upgrading the property
8. Sell the new and improved house for 350k. That's a 90k profit after paying the 240k for the mortgage and 20k repair

**BRIEF OVERVIEW OF RECON AFRICA AND THEIR EARLY SUCCESS**

A  team of oil exploration experts with diverse experience at super-majors including Exxon, Haliburton, and Conoco have confirmed the existence of a working, conventional oil &amp; gas system with world-class potential in the Namibian portion of the greater Okavango basin.

Since  Q1 2021, Recon Africa and their joint venture partner NAMCOR (the state-owned oil company of Namibia) have commenced and completed the 1st  phase of their oil exploration program **ahead of schedule**, by confirming the presence of conventional hydrocarbons (oil) in the Kavango Basin [**with just two stratigraphic test wells**](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Press-Release-080521.pdf).

The basin’s geological characteristics including age, size, and depth **could make this the largest conventional oil discovery in recent history.**

Despite the success and significant de-risking, the company currently trades at a  discount to when Recon Africa and the Republic of Namibia first declared  evidence of a working petroleum system in the Kavango basin on [April 15th, 2021.](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Press-Release-041521.pdf)

**The following is a summary I made of the exploration program to date to remind investors of where we are, how we got here, and where we are going.**

&amp;#x200B;

**NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS (AUGUST &amp; SEPTEMBER)**

Recon  Africa and state-owned JV partner NAMCOR, supported by several high-level Namibian government officials, will embark on an investor roadshow over the next several months to present findings from their exploration program, starting with presentations at two industry conferences ([Africa E&amp;P Summit ](https://africa.pesgb.org.uk/virtual-programme/)and [PESGB and HGS Africa E&amp;P Conference](https://www.frontierenergy.network/events/africa-e-p-summit-2021)) in September.

**What can we expect Recon Africa and NAMCOR to share with investors on the road?**

I believe we will receive additional data and analysis from the stratigraphic test wells -- analysis which **has been ongoing and delayed due to the pandemic** \-- as well as an update on the next phase of exploration including where the company plans to spud their next well.

Although  I expect Recon Africa and NAMCOR will keep most of the core data in the  data room  (JV partners will have to ""pay to play""), **investors can take comfort in knowing the core data from the first two wells** **was just promoted by the CEO of Core Labs**, Larry Bruno, [on the company's quarterly earnings call on July 29](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/29/core-laboratories-clb-q2-2021-earnings-call-transc/). Larry is quoted as saying:

""It's a very intriguing sedimentary basin onshore that has got a lot of opportunity for a variety of prospective, **productive horizons and traps**... It's a big, big basin with a thick section **of sedimentary mostly marine strata**...  **We're glad to be helping them**.""

In my experience, it is rare for an executive to spend so much time discussing a relationship or revenue stream that will not generate future shareholder value. I believe Larry was signalling to his investors they should expect Core Labs' future cash flows will be supported by revenues derived from a significant, long-term exploration program in the Kavango Basin. **This is an important signal I don't believe most Recon Africa investors have fully recognized or appreciated.**

Finally,  with Recon Africa communicating plans to facilitate a farm-out JV  process in Q4 to “further accelerate the overall evaluation,  exploration, and development of the 8.5 million acres under license”, we can reasonably expect enough information will be shared in these presentations **to pull “majors”** capable of making the significant CAPEX (investment) required of commercializing a large conventional oil &amp; gas discovery **into the data room.**

**The last and perhaps most important near-term catalyst** **will be the spudding of their 3rd well.**

The company is currently conducting 2D Seismic and Vertical Seismic  Profiling (VSP) which will inform the location for their next well.  Recon Africa and NAMCOR have announced plans to target traps with recoverable amounts of oil within the current exploration area and results from the next drill should offer investors a clear view of the potential size and value of the resource within the current exploration area (within the first of five prospective sub-basins).

**CURRENT VALUATION**

**Market Capitalization (as of Aug 13, 2021)**:

* USD: $1.0 billion
* CAN: $1.3 billion
* EUR: $875 million

**% Change in Stock Price**

* 30 Day: Down 30%

**Fully-Diluted Shares**: \~200 million

**% Held by Institutions**: &lt;1%

**% Held by Insiders**: &lt;5%

I believe the current market capitalization of Recon Africa **does not fairly account for the significant de-risking that has occurred to date**,  particularly as it relates to the resource potential of a working,  conventional oil &amp; gas system discovered in just one (1) of five (5)  potential sub-basins under leasehold. As mentioned above, the company is currently running 2D Seismic and Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) in both test wells **to further its understanding of “oil in place”** within the current exploration area.

Since seismic data is delivered in real-time, **it is reasonable to assume an estimate of contingent resources based on 2D  and VSP data alone could be made by the company at any time**.  Contingent resources do not consider commercial viability, which is ultimately determined by DST “flow testing”, but 2D and VSP can offer investors an estimate of the size and value of the potential resource within the current exploration area.

Knowing this, I would ask investors **how they think the market would react to an estimate of 2B barrels of contingent resources** in the current exploration area, knowing the company and its technical experts **have indicated the existence of rock porosity and permeability** – the two keys required to unlocking a conventional hydrocarbon system’s commercial value?

Based on recent valuations (relative comps) in the O&amp;G industry for **risked, unproven reserves** **of $1-3 USD BOE**,  our current market cap barely accounts for a modest discovery of approximately 500 million barrels of recoverable oil in the current exploration area, let alone any resources that may exist outside of this small parcel. The current exploration area represents less than 1% of the company’s entire leasehold.

At what amount of oil is there a 10x, 20x, or 30x upside? Turns out a  ""modest"" discovery by industry standards (e.g. 5-10B recoverable) could get us there.

I will comment on this more later but as a reference, preliminary data suggests the Kavango Basin exhibits [characteristics similar to the Zagros Fold and Thrust Belt](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/reconafrica-responds-to-short-seller-s-biased-and-false-short-report-899998915.html),  a petroleum province that houses 7% of the world's reserves. A province that has generated well over 100 billion barrels of recoverable oil.  I'm not saying investors should expect a 100x return, but based on what we know about the geology thus far, it remains a possibility.

**\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_**

**ADDRESSING FEAR / UNCERTAINTY / DOUBT (FUD)**

Investing in junior oil &amp; gas explorers is not for the faint of heart. Proving a highly valuable conventional discovery **is typically a long, slow process**.  Many of the world’s largest, most productive conventional oil &amp; gas plays were discovered after years of exploration and dozens of test wells. In Namibia, Recon Africa and NAMCOR have achieved what feels like  “the impossible” **with their first two wells**.

Over the past several weeks I have seen a significant increase in the number of people across investment forums spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the geology of the Kavango Basin and the “above-ground”  risks associated with this exploration program, despite additional data that further indicates this is indeed a world-class conventional oil  &amp; gas discovery.

Before I  address these “risks”, I want to remind readers it is much easier to doubt a rare success story than it is to believe in one. Also ask yourself, what do these “concerned investors with valid questions” gain by constantly filling your mind with FUD? Don’t they have better things to do?

The answer is simple: **they don’t have better things to do -- they make a lot of money when you get scared and sell.**

This play isn’t for everyone, but I hope the following helps you make the decision that is best for you.

**FEAR #1:** **Unproductive Geology**

Short sellers continue to spread fear surrounding why the company stopped drilling short of planned/permitted depths. I’ve read many posts claiming “they stopped short because this basin is a flop”. In other words, this basin is not as deep as the aeromagnetic survey led our technical team “to believe”, implying this basin will not be productive  (produce oil that can be extracted and sold).

**First**,  there is a margin of safety built into any permit application to allow for flexibility in the field, especially important for an explorer’s maiden drills. The permitted depth was one which the drill rig could safely achieve, not a depth where the company expected needing to reach.

Scot Evans, the CEO of Recon Africa, **recently gave investors the reason** for declaring touchdown where they did, but short sellers will say anything to lead you to believe you are being lied to. [His comments were](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Update-On-The-Worlds-Most-Exciting-Oil-Play-Interview-With-Scot-Evans.html)**:**

*“For the first well, based on initial aero mag mapping, we thought we would be drilling on a structure, and as the well was drilled it became clear that we were correct in our assumption. The well gave indications of crossing geologic faults at certain points, which can cause drilling issues if not correctly managed.* *After  drilling through the major intervals of hydrocarbon shows, the  frequency of potential faults began to increase, so to be safe we called  an early total depth.”*

Can you imagine how the market would have responded if a less experienced team drilled deeper and damaged the drilling tool? As a long-term investor, I am placing a premium on a management team that does not put their operation at risk, for any reason.

**Second**,  based on the information available to us, we have no evidence that this sub-basin is not as deep as the technical team initially hypothesized.  The aero mag data suggested this sub-basin is very deep, with steep sides, and some internal structure. The uplift that 6-2 was drilled on  (as described above by Scot Evans) is evidence of this structure. So,  with steep sides, and most likely steep faulted internal uplifts,  information from just the first well does not allow us to see the entire strat section, and it does not prove the depth-to-basement is not significant.

While the market has been busy selling off on fears of a shallow unproductive basin, it has clearly forgotten that conventional oil and gas **must have migrated from somewhere**.  I would have expected the market to place a premium on data that suggests we may indeed have significant amounts of shallow oil that can be recovered at a discount first to oil located in deeper reservoirs  (reservoirs where this oil may have even migrated from).

**Finally**, and most importantly, oil is oil. **The evidence of a working conventional hydrocarbon system is clear**:  this basin shows oil has migrated from the source, with “natural”  fracture associated porosity and permeability. No matter how the oil has been generated, we can expect 2D Seismic and VSP **will lead the technical team to target an area where it has been trapped.**

**FEAR #2:** **Company Value Will Be Held Back by Exploration Limitations**

The second fear is the easiest to refute because it’s the most irrational.  The fear surrounding “above-ground” risks, particularly how we will be treated by our host, the Republic of Namibia, has spooked many investors with little or no experience investing in international ventures.

I  read posts daily about “the exploration countdown clock” and how “once a  commercial discovery is declared, the clock starts ticking on our exploration license”.

In my professional M&amp;A experience, I can say with certainty that legal agreements between partners change all the time! In my opinion, the relinquishment clause (within the exploration agreement) was written to keep Recon Africa on a tight leash / ensure productivity and action (“we don’t want you making one quick discovery and neglect the rest of the basin!”) Agreements like these can be amended in good faith and given the depth of the relationship between Recon Africa and the Namibian government, I believe it will in due time.

**What gives me confidence that Recon Africa will be treated fairly by their host?**

Well, just this past week [we witnessed Recon Africa founder Craig Steinke and Diana McQueen meet with President Geingob](https://neweralive.na/posts/geingob-recon-a-potential-lifesaver)  and various ministers in what was very clearly a genuine display of a  healthy working relationship. President Geingob also commented extensively on how starved for investment Namibia has been, and how happy he is with the progress Recon Africa has made with both their oil  &amp; gas exploration and ESG program.

I  suspect short sellers will always cast doubt about the relationship between Recon Africa and Namibia, but I’d encourage investors to ask themselves what kind of a signal would Namibia be sending to the entire oil &amp; gas value chain if they blindsided the one company who took on the biggest risk, after praising them publicly?

Namibia needs to build goodwill to attract world-class vendors to this project and the best way to accomplish this is by acting in good faith with a JV  partner who has not only demonstrated they are capable of executing a  successful exploration program, but that they are also charged by advancing the quality of life of Namibians, as evidenced by their $10M  ESG pledge to fund programs that will benefit local communities.

Finally  -- to the short-sellers out there slinging FUD around “government risks” -- this is not only irrational, but it is also disrespectful. So far,  Recon Africa has been treated very fairly by the Republic of Namibia. I  don’t have a reason to believe they won’t continue to award Recon Africa opportunities to create future value. A company can earn respect by simply operating conscientiously and responsibly.

I see two partners treating each other exactly how they would like to be treated: **with mutual respect.**

**\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_**

**WHAT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO**

**Learning more about basin depth…**  2D seismic is an important piece to this massive exploration puzzle. If we have oil shows this shallow, what’s even further below? We know overweight drilling mud was used to account for pressure. Did all the oil we’ve seen migrate from an ocean of oil even further below?

**We still don’t know much about the rocks…**  Are they Otavi or even older? Do they predate land plants? Could the rocks be Proterozoic and oily by definition? What if they are WAY older than Permian? Would we have oil coming out of literally everything?  Maybe there are more than 120 billion barrels here. Maybe this entire basin is bigger than Kuwait. Still, a lot to learn.

**We don’t know a thing about the Botswana acreage…**  It’s long been speculated that the Botswana portion of the leasehold could be the deepest, and potentially, the most productive of the entire leasehold. Recon Africa acquired 100% of the exploration rights to the  Botswana leasehold through the acquisition of Renaissance Oil (who had  50%) yet the market has sold off since closing on the acquisition. At what point do we realize this value in the share price?

**Finding out who will be brought on to help commercialize this discovery…**  as an M&amp;A guy I geek out when deals get made. Who will show up at  Recon Africa’s door wanting a piece of this resource? Total? Chevron,  Exxon? Pipelines are expensive but supermajor balance sheets look pretty good. All very exciting stuff to look forward to.

**Learning more about the program’s carbon-neutral operating plan…**  technology advancements have made it possible for industrials,  including oil &amp; gas explorers, to operate net zero. Recon Africa’s significant investment in ESG early in their program, combined with the greenfield status of the project, leads me to believe they will live on the leading edge in this area and I can’t wait to see what they come up with.

**Receiving third-party estimates of recoverable resources…**  the biggest pay-day for investors could come with a third-party estimate of recoverable resources in the sub-basin Recon Africa and  NAMCOR are currently exploring. I have outlined estimates of returns based on potential proven reserves below.

**\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_**

**VALUATION POTENTIAL**

The following are simplistic estimates of potential market cap and share price based on recent valuations (relative comps) in the O&amp;G  industry for proven reserves (per barrel valuation considers both IPOs and acquisitions). Current valuations for proven resources range from  $3-5 USD and to be conservative I have chosen to use the lower end of this range.

I have also assumed the price per BOE increases with scale, accounting for asset leverage,  and encourage potential investors to make their own assumptions.

These figures represent estimates of proven recoverable oil in the current sub-basin only **and do not account for additional discoveries in any of the other 4 prospective sub-basins under leasehold.**

**1 to 2 billion barrels** of recoverable oil **@ USD 3.00 a BOE**

* **Market Cap** of approximately $4.5 B USD
* **Share Price** of approximately $25 USD
* **Potential Return:** Over 400%

**3 to 4 billion barrels** of recoverable oil **@ USD 3.50 a BOE**

* **Market Cap** of approximately $12 B USD
* **Share Price** of approximately $70 USD
* **Potential Return:** Over 1,200%

**4 to 5 billion barrels** of recoverable oil **@ USD 4.00 a BOE**

* **Market Cap** of approximately $18 B USD
* **Share Price** of approximately $105 USD
* **Potential Return:** Over 1,800%

**\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_**

**SUMMARY**

Investing in speculative oil &amp; gas explorers is not for everyone. **The highly technical nature of wildcat exploration leaves significant opportunity for predatory short sellers to play into fears,  uncertainties, and doubts associated with a program at every stage of exploration**. Don't so easily let predators' misinformation campaigns drive fear into your hearts and minds. Be diligent and vigilant and remember the stock market is not a game that favours the little guy. The easiest companies in the world to short **are the ones that are doing it right, not fast**. Finally, always remember it’s a lot harder to build something of REAL VALUE than it is to sling some FUD at the people trying.

Been lurking here for a couple of years but mostly for content and lols.
Have made good money buying the airline covid dip and getting into AMD 2+ years back. 

Disclaimer: I gamble on sports so I've no interest in day trading and options.. so why am I here? because wsb is v aware of retail trader products - their features and capabilities and so I'm hoping somebody can help me out. 

I would ideally like to group my positions into separate portfolios by theme and then automate different payments to invest into each. Within each portfolio I'd like to configure what % goes into which stock. 

e.g. I would like to invest b% of my net pay per month into companies that are building low code platforms or tooling. All I would like to setup is which companies are in this portfolio, how much I'd like to invest p/m (b) into the portfolio and how b gets split across my picks (% wise). 

Right now it feels so clunky having to manually put through my orders, and then track myself in spreadsheets. Is there something stopping this being automated and put in the hands of a smooth brain like me? Compliance issues in automating this stuff? Is this already available but through better apps or actual brokerages? 

I stumble upon robo advisors but all I need is a portfolio management screen (simple grouping) and automation. I don't need high frequency... I don't need HAL 9000 giving me 'AI due diligence' via. Wikipedia excerpts.

Two legions of believers destined to be eternally entwined in battle! On one side we have those who swear by the active fund managers and their superior returns. On the other, we have those who trust the good old index fund with all their life savings! 

[ ](https://i.redd.it/zxm0u6tkyih71.gif)

Pick your sides. It’s about time we put this argument to rest.  

**Data**

It’s one of those rare times where somebody else does all the legwork for your analysis. Almost all the data for this analysis is from the [2020 SPIVA U.S Scorecard report](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf). SPIVA is a division of the S&amp;P Global and has been considered as the de-facto scorekeeper in the active vs passive debate. They have produced a report every year since 2002. They have done all the dirty work of collecting and cleaning the data required for the analysis \[1\].

**Analysis \[2\]**

We will be analyzing the following types of funds

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lcpg77imyih71.png?width=494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee23ec2dc2649efd35fa9de7ef9169699babd1c9)

We will be then calculating the following

a. Percentage of funds underperforming the benchmark across time periods (1, 3, 5, 10 &amp; 20 years)

b. Average fund performance (1, 3, 5, 10 &amp; 20 years – Both Equal and Asset Weighted)

The above analysis should give us conclusive evidence on which approach is better both in the short as well as long term.

**Results**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fu5yzplnyih71.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6d150d0872d79fc49a5a5dcc942690abf3d015e)

The results are not pretty! Except for the lone one-year period for small-cap funds, most actively managed funds underperformed their corresponding index in all the other time frames across the different funds.

As we can see, these differences only become much more drastic over the long term. If you consider the Large-Cap Funds, over the last 20 years, 94% of the actively managed funds have underperformed S&amp;P500.

A similar story is repeated for Small and Mid-cap funds. We can conclude from here that it’s very unlikely that the fund you choose today will be able to beat the corresponding index over the long run.

But this is just one aspect of performance. What if you consider the average returns produced by the actively managed funds? Would they beat the market returns \[3\]?

https://preview.redd.it/cbriauooyih71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3344a479ae1025f9bb0c584f565c492d21c0ca4e

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1pmthyepyih71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b11e2681706fa6c9e983bba3d4ff8d0b985a9ca)

In both Asset and Equal weighted returns, the index funds have outperformed actively managed funds over the long run. The only place where we can say with some confidence that actively managed funds performed better is in small and mid-cap funds where returns from an actively managed fund were slightly better than the index. This again is applicable only for time periods which are lesser than five years and also you have to be diligent enough to pick the right fund at the beginning of your investment.

There are mainly two reasons I can think of why active funds are underperforming index funds

a.  The fees active funds charge add up over the long run and the market is becoming more and more efficient. While 40-50 years back, there would have been a better chance of a fund manager finding an undervalued stock, the abundance of information makes it difficult to find the diamonds in the rough. This can also be seen in the fact that active funds have relatively better success in mid and small-cap funds where there is more scope for price discovery when compared to large-cap stocks.

b.  We underestimate the changes that can happen over 20 years. The fund manager, management team, and even the fund strategy can change after seeing multiple rallies and recessions over 2 decades. So, the fund you started with would be vastly different after 20 years.

One callout here is that while benchmarking against actively managed funds, SPIVA (S&amp;P Global Subsidiary) pulled one over us!

[ ](https://i.redd.it/uzde048vyih71.gif)

The benchmark is calculated with respect to the index return without considering the cost associated with investing in the index (while the actively managed fund returns are calculated after fees). While this is a very small amount (0.03% for Vanguard SP500 ETF) when compared to actively managed funds (0.7-2%), it might change our final results slightly. But I don’t think it would in any way affect the overall results as the expense ratio is negligible for index funds.

**Return Comparison considering fees**

Since some of us would have a lingering question on the impact of the index fund fee, I did some calculations on the difference in return over 20 years if you invested in different funds. (The Index returns here are calculated after incorporating the fees – 0.03%)

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/copkzpewyih71.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3391a7a830facdd40f9ecf7c797ac9200509d0b)

This should be the final nail in the coffin for actively managed funds as in all the scenarios of our analysis, just investing in a passive index provided significantly better return over the long run.    

**Conclusion**

I am not saying that active funds are pointless. Different investors have different time horizons of investment. Active funds sometimes do tend to perform better than the index during significant market volatility. In these times, fund managers can be more selective (like converting the holdings to cash and then buying back at the bottom) whereas with index funds you will be replicating exactly what the market is going through.

But then again as we can see from our analysis, only &lt;15% of funds \[4\] beat the market in the long run (20 years). As we can see from the trends, longer time periods only work against the active fund managers. The chances of the fund making the right decision year over year reduce which is why it’s good to remember that past performance cannot be indicative of future returns.

So, to conclude, in almost all the cases, you would be better off just sticking to a passive index fund and letting it ride!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The data provided by SPIVA is accounted for survivorship bias, compares similar funds to its benchmark rather than comparing all types to SP500, and has also split its returns into both asset and equal-weighted methods. A detailed explanation for each is given in their official scorecard.

\[2\] This analysis would be limited to the data directly provided in the SPIVA report as they have not shared the raw data used in the analysis.

\[3\] Even if 86% of all funds underperformed the market over the last 20 years, what if the rest 14% created so much alpha that on avg returns actively managed funds beat the market?

\[4\] The chances of you picking the correct fund that will outperform the market in the next 20 years are very close to the chance of you predicting the correct number in a die throw! You can check your luck [here](https://freeonlinedice.com/).

Investment Thesis

Clover Health's (NASDAQ:CLOV) short positions, which constitute 23% of outstanding shares, sit on shaky ground, given the Company's high growth and strong financial position. Revenue grew 140% in Q2 2021, while the number of beneficiaries grew more than 126% in the same period.

With the recent unexpected growth in revenue, CLOV's valuation multiples are closer to industry peers, encouraging us to upgrade its rating from Neutral to Outperform. At the current revenue run rate ($1.6 billion-$1.7 billion), the Company only needs to increase its sales by 130% to match its peers' E.V./Sales multiples. This target is achievable, given the expanding market and CLOV's small market share. We also believe that weakly-founded short positions create an opportunity for extraordinary returns, as mutual funds following the Hindenburg Research realize they are at the wrong side of the trade.

Too much Pessimism - CLOV's Short Interest

At the time of this writing, CLOV's short interest stands at 23% of total shares outstanding, mirroring a pessimistic sentiment, possibly stemming from a scathing Hindenburg Research published by the short-selling investment firm earlier in February. The report cites several issues that we believe are blown out of proportion.

The main issue relates to CLOV's failure to disclose a DOJ's ""active investigation"" around its marketing practices, kickbacks, and undisclosed third-party transactions. Before highlighting these issues, one should note that the insurance industry is plagued by fraud, misconduct, and abuse of CMS rules. For example, data from Violation Tracker show that Humana (NYSE:HUM) has made 72 violations since 2000, costing shareholders $47 million in penalties. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has 316 records with total penalties summing to $610 million. We believe that the high number of violations causes the bad publicity currently lining the health payers' industry, stimulating regular audits and inspections by the CMS, Inspectors General Office, and the DOJ. The DOJ's request for information about the Company's practices doesn't constitute a Subpoena or a Civil Investigation. Instead, it is an inquiry that falls within the normal course of business. Below are excerpts from industry peers pointing to the regular inspections and regulatory inquiries within the industry.

Authorities regularly scrutinize the business practices of health insurance, health care delivery and benefits companies - Humana

Because of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries - UnitedHealth

[..] These investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings include routine and special inquiries by state insurance departments, state attorneys general, the US Attorney General and subcommittees of the US Congress - Anthem (ANTM)

For this reason, we believe that the DOJ's information request doesn't constitute a solid foundation for a short position. It is worth noting that the ""active investigation"" is old news, at least one and a half years ago. If the DOJ had an intention to pursue the issue further, it would have done that by now. The Hindenburg report stimulated an SEC investigation, which also hasn't developed into a Civil Investigation or instigated a subpoena, seven months after the SEC's information request. For this reason, we believe that the ""Existential Risk"" mentioned in the Hindenburg report is an overstatement.

The Obvious Choice - Clover's Business Model

Medicare Advantage is a government program allowing insurers to provide coverage on behalf of the government. The industry is heavily regulated, with the CMS mandating that participants offer at least the actuarily equivalent of its original/federal Part A and Part B Plans. CLOV can exceed this target, providing what it calls ""the obvious choice"" in terms of affordability and service due to its contracts with its healthcare provider network. While Original Medicare offers national coverage across almost all hospitals and healthcare providers nationwide, CLOV has a limited network of hospitals that it contracts for its beneficiaries at a lower price. This allows the Company to pass these cost savings to its beneficiaries in lower co-pays and Part D premiums. The figure below shows that almost two-thirds of MA enrollees don't pay a premium for Prescription Drug Plan.

Prescription Drug Plan

CLOV shares this business model with the remainder of the industry. Today, 50% of people registering for Medicare choose a Medicare Advantage plan.

A complicated model determines CLOV's premiums and rebates by incorporating variables such as service quality (measured by a star rating), risk factors (measured by patient's medical history and individual characteristics), and a base rate set by the Health Secretary's Office. Generally, the algorithm allows insurers to maximize revenue by lowering costs and increase service quality. This is the reason CLOV (and other insurers) touts its software capabilities, given that optimizing costs is paramount to its business models.

Expanding Market - Revenue Trends

The Medicare Advantage, ""MA,"" market is proliferating, with 13,000 individuals becoming eligible for the program every day. The percentage of beneficiaries choosing MA is also on the rise, driven by the valued-add third-party insurers bring to the market. Politically, Washington wants the program to succeed, given the risk/reward shift it brings away from CMS to the private sector.

Total Medicare Advantage Enrollment 

Source: www.kff.org

CLOV's MA beneficiaries grew 18% in Q2 2021, from 56,815 to 66,566 members. Moreover, the Company entered the Direct Contracting market, increasing the lives covered by approximately 100%. As of June 30, the total number of beneficiaries stood at 126,591 individuals for both the MA and Direct Contracting segments.

Revenue increased 140%, driven mainly by the Direct Contracting business. Although the CMS closed the door for new applicants, existing members such as CLOV can continue receiving premiums and rebates beyond the 2021 year-end, providing revenue stability within the segment and supporting our growth thesis.

Sufficient Liquidity - Financial Position

CLOV's 126,591 beneficiaries generate $1.6 billion run rate annual revenue according to management estimates. This is worth something, even though CLOV is currently unprofitable. In worst cases, if the Company fails to monetize its customer base, it can seek a strategic alternative, e.g., an acquirer with a lower cost base than CLOV.

However, the base case scenario is that the Company will find its footing in terms of costs; Medical Cost Ratio, ""MCR,"" has been disrupted in recent quarters by pent-up demand due to COVID. Beneficiaries who postponed physician visits during lockdown are now highly utilizing their policies in the form of hospital and physician visits, pushing MCR above premiums. MCR in the last three quarters was 111%, 108%, and 109%, compared to an extraordinary low utilization in Q2 and Q3 2020 when MCR dropped to 70% and 87%, respectively. We believe that MCR will return to normal rates as the backlog loosens.

In any case, CLOV's financial position buys it time to adjust its operations and optimize profitability. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents stood at $600 million compared to an operating cash burn of $64 million during the quarter. The Company can adjust its plan prices and coverage annually. Given the stickiness of beneficiaries, it can do this with low customer attrition, needless to say, within reason, given the competitive market and the regulatory limitations.

Growth Changes Everything - Valuation Revisited

The Medicare Advantage market is highly concentrated among a few prominent players. However, an expanding market and low barriers to entry allow CLOV to find its footing in the market. At current price levels, the Company is undervalued in light of its growth rate and revenue base. The average industry EV/Forward Sales is 0.7x. This means that for CLOV to reach a similar valuation, it needs to increase its sales to $3.9 billion. TTM annual sales are $900 million; however, its revenue run rate is $1.6 billion and Q2 revenue is $412 million, translating to $1.6 billion in annualized sales. This means that for the Company to reach its peers' valuation, it only needs to increase its revenue by 130%, which is reasonably achievable, given its small market share, low revenue base and expanding market.

Clover Health vs. Peers EV to Revenues

Data by YCharts

Summary

The Hindenburg Research report blows CLOV's troubles out of proportion. The insurance industry is plagued with bad publicity due to repeated violations from long-standing peers, pushing the DOJ, Inspector's General Office, and the CMS to conduct regular inquiries and audits, which don't constitute a Subpoena or a Civil Investigation. It's been seven months since the SEC initiated an investigation into these issues and at least one and a half years since the DOJ's probe. If any of these entities wanted to pursue these issues, they would have done it by now. The fear and pessimism over CLOV are overstated, opening an opportunity for extraordinary returns as the Company continues to grow its revenue base and most likely its net income.

Pent-up demand from COVID is causing high policy utilization, as people are finally making the physician visits postponed during the lockdown. This is increasing the Company's costs relative to premium revenue. We believe that going forward, the rate of utilization and medical care ratio, ""MCR,"" will normalize as the backlog loosens.

We are upgrading our rating from Neutral to Outperform given the unexpected increase in revenue, bringing the Company's valuation multiples closer to peers' average.

I replied hmm, okay.

Than I fucking recieved the [pic](https://m.imgur.com/a/0yqBhDd)

Found the make of the fridge, also searched everything on picture if it was available in Poland.

So now Im baffled by the outcome, and thinking about what should I do?

FuelPositive Hires Core NH3 Technology Patent Co-Inventor Dr. Ghassan Chehade to Lead Prototype Manufacturing

TORONTO, July 26, 2021  FuelPositive Corporation (TSX.V: NHHH) (OTCQB: NHHHF)

(“FuelPositive” or the “Company”) has hired engineer Dr. Ghassan Chehade, one of the co-inventors named on the provisional patent of the Company’s technology that will produce carbon-free ammonia (NH3). Dr. Chehade worked with Dr. Ibrahim Dincer on the original development of the Company’s core NH3 technology. He has joined the Company as Lead Project Engineer.

“Ghassan will play a significant role, working closely with National Compressed Air Canada Ltd., as we manufacture our Phase 2 commercial prototype demonstration systems for carbon-free NH3 production,” said Ian Clifford, Fuel Positive CEO. “The manufacturing of demonstration prototypes is a major milestone for us, as we transition from research and development to the commercialization phase of our growth. Having Ghassan involved daily will ensure success, preparing us for the rollout of our demonstration pilot projects in early 2022.”

“I am very excited to join Fuel Positive as a Lead Project Engineer. I look forward to working with Ian and his team on advancing this very important technology to the next phase,” said Ghassan Chehade.

The Company’s carbon-free NH3 technology, takes air, water and sustainable electricity and converts it to a non-polluting chemical for multiple applications, fertilizer for farming, fuel for combustion engines and a solution for grid storage. It is being considered as a replacement for fossil fuels and as the enabler of the hydrogen economy. Not only does the production of FuelPositive’s carbon-free NH3 require much less energy than producing hydrogen on its own, but ammonia stores 65% more hydrogen than highly compressed pure hydrogen, making ammonia the most efficient way to safely store and transport hydrogen.",wallstreetbets,$NHHHF Fuelpositive. $0.18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4w1yp/nhhhf_fuelpositive_018/

Step 3: Raise money from investors at an obscene valuation on the basis that you’re a visionary tech company. Don’t bother forecasting profits and creating conservative pro-forma statements, from which investors can derive a sensible valuation of your business. Instead, let the investors imagine how profitable your company can eventually become.

Step 5: At the peak of the stock market bubble, take your company public at twice your last valuation.

Hey guys, 
I’ve been doing a research for the past couple of weeks and I would like to share my conclusion with you.


(1) First of all option trading was extremely bullish prior to the earnings which it’s on the 23rd of September, so I don’t think bulls are bullish for the earnings or maybe they do 🤔

(3)Unknown tweet seemed extremely bullish and stating that it will breakthrough all times high, and stating that there is a big news coming, is it the earnings? I don’t think so 😁

[(3)](https://twitter.com/man00666/status/1426566741145096197?s=21)


(4)Jarvis-Alerts tweet about the calls but the expiry day is before the earnings, so is it flying before earnings 🤔

Alright all of these tweets were predictions and confusingly bullish.
I did my analysis to try to figure what’s the story behind that,

Rite Aid Corporation is an American drugstore chain based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1962 in Scranton, Pennsylvania by Alex Grass under the name Thrift D Discount Center. The company ranked No. 150 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

(7) Karen lynch, CEO of CVS, also director of Bancorp investment,
her LinkedIn 👇🏻
[(7)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenslynch)

We will notice that Donigan first job was on CIGNA Healthcare as president and SVP Operation, after that lynch continued to be CEO of CIGNA and they clearly have the same They have the same aspects.

(8) In this video Donigan Stated ‘’We Could be doing the Vaccines in the store if we had the supply’’👇🏻
[(8)](https://youtu.be/pcx1NdowbMQ)

A inside source stated that 2 meetings was conducted between Donigan and lynch in July and 4 meetings was conducted between them in August.
Another source stated that on August 9th Donigan visited CVS Headquarter with hair legal team.

(9) If we look into the history of CVS we will find that they made 9 acquisitions and 1 investment, and the Company spent over 179B for the acquisitions.
[(9)](https://cvshealth.com/about-cvs-health/our-purpose/our-history)


Throughout the pandemic these companies did an abnormal action, providing vaccines, Covid-tests, and many other services, Donigan and Lynch stated that they will continue their
Expansion of their Services, by manufacturing and distributing vaccines, COVID-19 testing and many other services, Donigan stated that there is a need for a hub in every street
To provide these kind of services.

In conclusion, Many rumors is spreading that an acquisition is on its final stage and there are many new services are coming to the sector.

We are looking for an acquisition, new partnership in manufacturing and distributing vaccines, A new form of Covid-19 testing,or maybe all of that.

There is something suspicious and I think the stock will fly next week 🚀🚀🚀🚀

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.

&amp;nbsp;

All that being said, there aren’t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I’ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

All in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there’s little edge to be gained among those that aren’t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know!

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips

Today, investors in UK-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) are seeing some pretty steep declines. In fact, shares of ARVL stock are currently down approximately 7% at the time of writing. Today’s price action seems to indicate investors are presently looking elsewhere for growth.

However, there are a few catalysts long-term investors in this early stage EV company will like. Various catalysts saw shares of this de-SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) surge from its SPAC initial public offering (IPO) level of $10 to as high as $37 earlier this year on intense momentum among SPAC stocks. However, like many of Arrival’s de-SPAC peers, recent price action has not been favorable of late.

In fact, Arrival has lost more than two-thirds of its market value from its peak. Investors placing their bets on the EV sector appear to be focusing in on the bigger, more established players today. Accordingly, Arrival remains a high-risk, high-reward bet in the world of EV stocks.

That said, let’s dive into two key catalysts that could position ARVL stock for a nice run.

Two Catalysts Are the Key for Investors in ARVL Stock
Investors in ARVL stock are making a bet that this early stage EV company can hit its production targets. Today, executives told investors that the company is on track to begin production of its EV bus and van in 2022.

This is big news, as investors price in the timing of cash flows into their models. Any early stage EV company carries some level of execution risk. Investors betting on ARVL stock are essentially betting on the management team to do what they say they’re going to do. Indeed, this not only means on the production end of the equation but on the demand side as well. Investors are expecting updates on the company’s fulfillment plans for its key van order with UPS (NYSE:UPS). This order is expected to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue for Arrival.

Secondly, investors looking at ARVL stock will have to consider a key announcement the company made last week. Last Thursday, the company announced plans to partner with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on developing a cloud-based data platform for EV fleets. Given Microsoft’s backing for this project, many investors have begun to get excited about the technology angle with ARVL stock.

However, again, this comes back to execution. Investors seem to be waiting for tangible results on these projects before jumping aboard. Accordingly, it appears ARVL stock is one that’s likely to be volatile for some time, as investors price in these catalysts alongside operational risk.

Market cap not even 1.2x multiple of 2021 revenue estimate.

Unusually large dip after an earnings win (labeled as a miss).

Whats up everyone. This article will be short and sweet. You might remember me from 2012 when I correctly predicted a few FDA drug approvals yielding 10X+ gains. Since then I have been raising venture capital, working with (starting and selling) tech companies, writing patents, and investing in my own accounts.

This time we are looking at a Medicare company, well… its actually a rapidly growing tech/internet company…. That is severely miss priced, to our advantage.

GoHealth, Inc. (GOCO), is a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare focused digital health company. The stock is currently trading close to $4 with an average price target by the big analysts at well above $12.

The company is on track to do $1.3B in revenue for 2021, yet its market cap is just $1.5B. Not even a 1.2X multiple. Their market cap is not even a 3X multiple of the $500M cash and credit they have on hand on their balance sheet. Long time established, low growth insurance companies trade at 2X to 6X their twelve trailing month revenue. GOCO’s revenue increased 4X from 2018 to 2020. It’s revenue is on track to more than 2.5X year-over-year. There is a lot of growth ahead for GOCO.

They just reported earnings (I suggest everyone listen to the call and look at the financials and 8-K). They exceeded revenue estimates - growing 84% compared to the year prior. Second quarter revenue growth was 55%.

They have so much growth and customer interest that their agents can’t keep up with the demand. To fix this they have invested heavily in HR and hiring more great agents. They spent more on growth than WallStreet thought they would or could… so they missed an earnings estimate which produced an unusually big dip, close to 50%. Most of WallStreet just doesn’t understand how businesses work and grow… all good.

This earning miss is nothing to worry about. It’s actually a good thing and should make the market feel more confident. Very healthy. They are growing extremely fast and reinvesting their profits in more growth, just as Amazon and all the other uber successful tech companies have done. 

Even though their revenue is growing hand over fist, they are spending it on more growth, which means we will not see profit for the next bit, but this is a good thing. A soon as they taper off the reinvesting and “show” profits I anticipate this company will 10X from its current price. It will be trading above $40.

And if you haven’t forgotten... we are in a pandemic... there has never been a more bullish time to invest in health insurance companies.

This should be a meme stock. It’s going to the moon. Buy the dip!

This is an easy one. I am surprised it has been flying under the radar. Enjoy.

LAS VEGAS, Aug. 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via InvestorWire -- Golden Triangle Ventures, Inc. (OTC PINK: GTVH) announces a successful preliminary flower testing of its HyGrO hydrogen water technology.  


Halcyon Hemp conducted a 21-day preliminary study of the effect of HyGrO water on extending the longevity of cut flowers. The flowers used in this study were stock roses, carnations and gladiolas, provided by Campbell’s Flowers, one of the most reputable floral outlets in Colorado. From the results, photos, and observations made in this study, the company concluded that water produced using HyGrO’s patent-pending technology could increase the shelf life of cut flowers, reduce the bloom rate, and potentially reduce waste in the floral industry.

Due to the positive preliminary results obtained at the completion of this study, management is now pursuing a larger-scale study to implement HyGrO water technology with a commercial-scale professional flower producer to study the effects of the technology on additional varieties, obtain a predictable outcome, and prove the technology, which will assist management in its rollout strategy.

Robert “Bo” DuBose, CEO of HyFrontier Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Triangle Ventures, states, “There are no words to properly express my shock and excitement at these results. The idea came from HyFrontier’s VP of Sales and Support, Martin Lorenz, who is an experienced master grower and connected within the ornamental flower agricultural sector. I would like to extend a special thanks to the owners of Campbell’s Flowers - Zach and Travis - for obliging Martin to run this test through their facility. The pictures and comments we received absolutely speak for themselves, and this represents an entirely new avenue for HyGrO. Following this test, Martin further engaged with the largest distributor of cut flowers in Colorado, and we are now testing close to 100 ornamental sets, in which we plan to prove the benefits of HyGrO and obtain a true standardized outcome on each flower variety. Additionally, moving forward, we will be testing essentially every type of ‘cut plant’ that is watered in the produce department at grocery stores. Our entire team is elated for the possibility to see other key ways we can not only help provide higher yields but to also improve shelf life at the retailer so customers can enjoy fresher and longer lasting flowers at home.”

In light of China’s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe’s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart.  This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.

But this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.

They reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

# EPS

Even if this ER is about forward guidance, there’s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe’s first profitable quarter as a newly public company.  Analysts’ average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source).  We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS.  For Q2, they won’t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat.  My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn’t work out that way, but it’s entirely plausible.

&amp;#x200B;

# Revenue

Regarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let’s ignore the facts that

* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),
* Paysafe’s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar’s, DraftKings and Penn,
* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,
* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: “We continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.”
* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).

Rather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe’s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe’s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).

Paysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million.  With $341 million in revenue for Q1’20, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth.  We’ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.

Analysts’ average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source).  That's right in the middle of guidance.  Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there’s a very good chance that they’ll beat the analyst estimate.  That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.

As a long-term investor, I’ll be happy with anything above 7%.  From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.

Last quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe’s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.

This confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits.  By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

# Recent Price Action

As Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe ""has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.""

Over the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.

\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market.  It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day.  It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe’s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\]  But I digress.

While the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling.  Very recent 13F’s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.

# Bottom?

Whoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.

The current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, “cross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.”

Said in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:

# M&amp;A / inorganic growth

Along the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.”

Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X.  Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return.  He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” ^(6,9)

Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further:  “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.”

&amp;#x200B;

# Rounding out the Picture:

\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.  Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets.   It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.

Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.   Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.”

Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11   --)   By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)

&amp;#x200B;

# iGaming Expansion

It's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe’s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below).  Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don’t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.

As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""

He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”

Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”

Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,”

Del Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.” ^(5)  Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:

# Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a ""BUY""

Some quotes :

RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: “We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.” “recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE’s business and the FTAC II transaction” and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: “PSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it’s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.” ^(4)

RBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: “Our positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it’s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it’s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.

BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: “PSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE’s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.” iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow “at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world” with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" ^(3)

Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its “robust risk management operation,” and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(2)

&amp;#x200B;

# MOAT: “robust risk management operation”

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” ^(9)

&amp;#x200B;

# Valuation

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),

By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.

Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.

Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the “mid to high teens.” But even if you include 2020’s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

    •	EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
    
    •	EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
    
    •	EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

    •	EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75
    
    •	EV/Rev ratio : $44.64
    
    •	EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average : $46.52

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options.  I’ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions.  Common shares is the way.

So I know I'm a little late, but I finally got around to updating my financials to incorporate CLF's recent 10-Q filing - and I'm very surprised. 

My previous PT was $32.25, and after inputting their new data, the **new PT is approximately $41!!!** Morgan Stanley can eat a dick. I'd love to see that ""analysis"". How does a PT of $26 make sense when their NAV alone is $3.5 billion (27% of current market cap)

Honestly, I'm shocked, but the numbers don't lie. DCF is the best way to put a market value on a company, and this is what the numbers are saying.

Assumptions:

\- Steel isn't like lumber and won't suddenly fall to normal or historical levels within a month. Lumber skyrocketed due to COVID causing a supply shortage, while demand remained steady. Steel prices have increased not only because of supply shortages &amp; demand increases, but also because of global governmental &amp; political catalysts. China will be announcing export tariffs within the next month before their building season starts in October. These taxes will range between 15-25%. 

\- Steel prices will remain elevated until Late 2022 or Early 2023.

\- Q3 &amp; Q4 financials will closely mimic Q2

\- CLF will continue to pay down debt &amp; return money to shareholders

\- CLF doesn't idle operations due to another covid variant. I think it's very unlikely since they are offering their employees $3,000 to get the shot. LG is a savage.

The analysis above is important because the surge in steel companies is almost solely due to market price increases. 

&amp;#x200B;

From CLF's 10-k and their raised forward guidance:

""The full-year revision is based on better-than-expected contractual renewals and the assumption that the **US HRC index price averages $1,100 per net ton for the last nine months of the year**. "" 

As of 8/11/21 (my 32nd birthday btw), the **weighted average price per ton according to the HRC futures index is $1756 for the rest of 2021**, or in other words, a fucking **56.7% increase** over CLF's assumption that their forward guidance hinges on. 

Now, just because the weighted average of the futures prices is $1756, doesn't mean that CLF has locked in pricing or has contracts at that specific price. However, what it does show that prices have elevated to a greater level than they forecasted, and they are very likely realizing that tailwind.

In light of China’s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe’s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.

But this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.

They reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.



EPS

Even if this ER is about forward guidance, there’s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe’s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts’ average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won’t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn’t work out that way, but it’s entirely plausible.



Revenue

Regarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let’s ignore the facts that

* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),
* Paysafe’s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar’s, DraftKings and Penn,
* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,
* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: “We continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.”
* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).

Rather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe’s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe’s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).

Paysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1’20, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We’ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.

Analysts’ average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there’s a very good chance that they’ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.

As a long-term investor, I’ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.

Last quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe’s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.

This confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.



Recent Price Action

As Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe ""has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.""

Over the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.

\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe’s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\] But I digress.

While the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F’s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.

Bottom?

Whoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.

The current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, “cross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.”

Said in another way, because Paysafe has excluded US iGaming growth from its projections, literally none of the following developments in value creation have yet been priced in:

M&amp;A / inorganic growth

Along the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.”

Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” 6,9

Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.”



Rounding out the Picture:

\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.

Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.”

Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). 11 -- By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). 12



iGaming Expansion

It's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe’s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don’t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.

As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""

He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”

Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”

Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,”

Del Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.” 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:

Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a ""BUY""

Some quotes :

RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: “We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.” “recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE’s business and the FTAC II transaction” and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: “PSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it’s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.” 4

RBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: “Our positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it’s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it’s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.

BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: “PSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE’s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.” iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow “at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world” with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" 3

Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its “robust risk management operation,” and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2



MOAT: “robust risk management operation”

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” 9



Valuation

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),

By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.

Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.

Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the “mid to high teens.” But even if you include 2020’s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

&amp;#x200B;

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&amp;#x200B;

More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

&amp;#x200B;

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75
* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64
* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average : $46.52

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.



This is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I’ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.

However AMC is currently under attack from Shorts going up to 20% short interest &amp; above 95% of utilization of shares on loan!!! AMC is fuckin primed for a short squeeze we just need more buying pressure!!!

I'm not saying give up on GME, I love GME and totally respect that they started the APE movement... I'm just saying if enough GME holders sold off their shares to buy AMC (you can buy 5 shares of AMC with 1 share of GME) That would do 2 major things!!!

1. AMC would go up in price due to all the buying pressure, this could trigger the short squeeze

2. GME would drop in price, causing more shorts to take positions on the dropping stock, causing the price to drop even further!

Why both of those are great things... Firstly once AMC squeezes many of us will be looking for the next big move... imagine GME is back down to $50 with 30% short interest, it would be a prime target for our next move!!! Secondly you could take your AMC Squeeze Profits and buy way more shares of GME, even if you only invested what you previously sold your GME for you'd still have way more shares because of the drop in price!!!

I'm not saying give up on GME, I'm suggesting if enough GME holders made a swing trade for a week or two to AMC it would vastly benefit both parties.... Mathematics tells us doing what's best for the group as a whole leads to everyone being in a better position. (Watch the scene from A Beautiful Mind where he talks about his friends all wanting to hookup with the hottest girl and all getting rejected, but by going for her friends first they all get a woman  lol good movie)


Just an idea, please don't hate... lol, if you think this is a smart move please keep it going and spread it out there!


* I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice... please do your own research and make the decision on your own


I am not a ""Shill"" I want both AMC &amp; GME to squeeze!!! The hedgies have been playing mind games with us this whole time... let's play back!!! This move would benefit both groups and trick more hedgies to short GME, while allowing yous to buy back in at a lower price... it's not giving up on GME it's a 1 2 punch to fuck with the hedgies

He has said since 2017 that ""turnaround"" is complete BUT the revenue has dropped since then from 3billion to now just 800million and dropping again this year. 

This is a big claim but based on what i have read and how the institutions like Ontario Teachers Fund ([here is proof](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbry/ontario-teachers-pension-plan-board))have fully exited the company is worrying. This is all through help of Prem Watsa, board member, and CEO john chen. They propped up the company by lying to investors about turnaround and future prospect while helping big institutions exit the position. Teachers fund at one point used to own 50 million shares of BB. 

Chen has been collecting millions in salary (over 100million in last 7 years) while the stock and revenue continues to drop. 

Based on no support from management I'm starting to think this is another Enron. Why else would the management all of the sudden stop doing TV interviews? Where is the sales and turnaround that was claimed 3 years ago? Why is the revenue still dropping while cyber security and car businesses have boomed in last 3-5 years?

Volkswagen has ordinary (VOW) and preference (VOW3) shares.

Preference shares in Europe are different from the preference shares in the US. They have identical economic rights but do not have voting rights – so economically they are pretty much identical and historically were trading hand in hand. 

However after the recent rush into VW stock the spread between VOW and VOW3 shares blew up – VOW now is at EUR298 and VOW3 us at EUR205. There is no economic reason for that, fundamentally you are buying the same cash flow.

This vehicle-based payment solution will create new opportunities for automakers to offer a vast array of payment services and develop previously untapped revenue streams. The solution will create a ""digital fingerprint"" for the vehicle, allowing it to securely connect to a bank's payment network, validate, and autonomously pay for a wide range of frequently used services, including fuel, tolls, parking, insurance, maintenance, and other ""wallet"" capabilities. Historically, vehicle-based payment processes have been complex and leverage legacy banking primitives such as physical credit cards or multiple smartphone apps to communicate with each individual merchant and service provider.

This is a massive step and hopefully the first of a number of key pieces of news that could be used as potential catalysts for BB over the coming days.

When you walk through them and see that one is x6 leverage (🚀) and one is x35 (🚀🚀🚀🚀) it opens your eyes and makes you think a bit more carefully about what you're doing so you don't accidentally do something too safe. 

I like to follow the philosophy that if you can't teach something you don't understand it well enough so I made this into a video that explains this entirely using PowerPoint icons, which is linked at the bottom. I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. 

When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. 

Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. 

A 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and a daily UPRO call could have 100x. Know what you're getting yourself into before you throw your money into something. 

🚀🚀🚀🚀
TLDR: Option Leverage = (Delta * Share Price) / Option Price
🚀🚀🚀🚀

Example: Visa 240c 9/17 = (59 * 243.17) / 853 = 16.82

According to señor [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/tax-treatment-call-put-options.asp), 

&gt; When call options are exercised, the premium paid for the option is included in the cost basis of the stock purchase. Take for example an investor who buys a call option for Company ABC with a $20 strike price and June 2020 expiry. The investor buys the option for $1, or $100 total as each contract represents 100 shares. The stock trades at $22 upon expiry and the investor exercises the option. The cost basis for the entire purchase is $2,100. That's $20 x 100 shares, plus the $100 premium, or $2,100. 

&gt;Let's say it is August 2020 and Company ABC now trades at $28 per share. The investor decides to sell their position. A taxable short-term capital gain of $700 is realized. That's $2,800 in proceeds minus the $2,100 cost basis, or $700.

So if I bought NUE Calls with a $165 strike, but it only hit $150 when I sell - do I only pay taxes on 

**Total Sale Proceeds - Original Purchase Cost**

And then it would be considered a short-term capital gain?

Beets are a nutritious plant known primarily for their succulent, bright red root, which is called the beetroot. Consuming large amounts of beets is a known detoxification strategy, and beets are also high in vitamins. 

Now, how do we make money off of this? Simple. You have two avenues. 

*Avenue 1*

Become a beet farmer. 

Sell everything you own, but as many beet seeds as you can afford, and move to rural Pennsylvania. Plant those suckers and just watch the profits rake in as those literal green candles shoot out of the dirt after the first rainfall. 

At around $2 a pound, beets have a great ROI, considering an ounce of beet seeds costs $4 dollars. Each ounce will get you about 1600 seeds. Assuming it costs 50% of your profit to grow those delicious underground strawberries, you’d still be getting an 800% ROI. 

*Avenue 2*

Beet futures. 

Beets are used to make sugar, so just yolo everything into those. I don’t even know how to do that, but someone on here made a killing on gourds a few months ago so, trust me, you cannot go wrong with produce futures.

Hey retards, here's another special dividend play for a special boy. 

McAfee may have made your wife’s boyfriend hard, but Ecovyst will make you SO RICH you can finally fuck some strippers to satisfy yourself since your wife won’t. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ecovyst (ECVT) just announced a special dividend of $3.2/share, which at a share price of $16.2 is OVER a 20% return! Now I am not here to talk about a boomer 20% return, but more so how this news has not been priced into the stock/options and provides a perfect short-term options play 

Over the past few days ECVT has traded relatively flat, only really increasing over the past day or so. News of this insane dividend has barely made any headlines and no one seems to know about it. Once more people find out about this stock and buy in for that 20% return, the price will EXPLODE

Since the announcement of the dividend, the stock has ONLY increased by 8 cents

https://preview.redd.it/rxekeqrr6jg71.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b419466a891ac768925d3195b2bc86953adc

The stock ‘should’ drop around $3.2 after the ex. dividend date (efficient market hypothesis) which ‘should’ mean people won’t buy in just for the dividend, but people (and the market in general) are irrational and greedy so stocks generally have run-ups prior to special dividends (see price action on RKT, MCFE, AFG, SUTL ect.)

Special dividends also signify to the market that the company is being successful 

In addition to this, the stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of only around 223,000 shares and an institutional ownership of OVER 69%. This means the stock will MOON if only a small amount of people buy in 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides the whole special dividend play, ECVT is actually a decent, profitable growth company. Y/Y revenues were up 47% and they posted a profitable quarter of $0.11/share. They manufacture and catalyze chemicals for green tech, which will be a growing industry in the future. I know this play is not about the viability of the company, but this being a decent company takes some of the risk away

Additionally, options have not priced in ANY pre-dividend volatility, the 8/20 $15C only needs to have the stock go up 0.92% to make money

The ex. Dividend date for the special dividend is aftermarket 8/11 so I would sell before then

The record date is on the 12th, so if you are feeling risky you could hold until 8/12 

My positions: 

10 8/20 $15 C, 10 8/20 $17.5 C

ALRIGHT RETARDS. This is the only $SAVA DD you'll need to read to understand what's going on with Alzheimer's research. I broke it up into 3 parts so your tiny attention spans would be able to read it over time. This is the third part, the part i know you all care about: **Valuation.**

## TLDR:

1. I present an **extremely conservative** Discounted Cash Flow model of Simufilam sales (if successful) that values SAVA at **$18.91B or $472 per share**. This model only includes US sales until 2027.
2. SAVA was recently attacked by short selling, dishonest journalism, and unreasonable lawsuits. At current price ($96.04), it presents a buy opportunity. The CEO has hinted at a [major announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyvnm7/sava_the_biggest_blockbuster_in_pharmaceutical/) in the near future.
3. I believe that SAVA is a daunting buyout opportunity and an attractive partnership opportunity. If a Big Pharma company were to buy SAVA, I believe the size of the buyout would need to be one of the largest ever, perhaps even larger than Gilead's [purchase](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/10/gilead-sciences-completes-acquisition-of-immunomedics-inc) of Immunomedics for $21B. Another way for SAVA shareholders to unlock the value of its research is in a licensing deal with a Big Pharma. In this case, we can expect the value of SAVA to continually grow into the $18B+ valuation I provided from US and global sales of Simufilam running to 2037.

# Valuation

Let's run a simple and conservative Discounted Cash Flow model for Simufilam sales in the next 7 years (assume 5 years of sales starting 2023):

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|2027|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Number of mild to moderate US AD patients|3,636,000 |3,792,000 |3,948,000 |4,104,000 |4,260,000|4,416,000 |4,572,000|
|Market Penetration|0%|0%|10%|16%|22%|27%|33%|
|\# of US Patients Being Treated with Simufilam |0|0| 394,800 |649,800 |923,000 |1,214,400 |1,524,000|
|Annual Cost of Drug|0|0 |15000|15000|15000|15000|15000|
|Total Revenue from Simufilam|0|0|5.922B|9.747B|13.845B|18.216B|22.86B|
|50% Revenue [split](https://www.eisai.com/news/news201760.html) |0|0|2.961B|4.873B|6.922B|9.108B|11.43B|

Based on an extremely conservative **discount rate of 12%**, the net present value is **$18.91B.**

This simple model only looks at 5 years of sales and only 10% market penetration in the first year of sales. SAVA has patents on Simufilam [running till 2037](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/09/03/2088467/8339/en/Cassava-Sciences-Announces-New-Patent-Grant.html). Additionally, the model does not include global sales. Cassava Sciences at the current market cap of 3.86B is an asymmetric risk opportunity. At current valuation, the market gives SAVA a 20% chance of reaching this valuation. I believe this percentage **should be much higher**. 

**Phase 3 is de-risked by 9 month data results**. Simply put, as time passes and each of SAVA's trials progress and return positive data, the likelihood that Simufilam succeeds in Phase 3 increases (see Addendum). As the likelihood of success increases, the valuation of SAVA should also increase.

1. Cramer said SAVA was a sell because SAVA was [""trying to get people off opioids""](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/cramer-lightning-round-hold-on-to-roblox.html). 
2. Benzinga released an [article](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/07/21918964/cassava-sciences-shares-fall-sharply-lower-after-stat-news-reports-fda-calls-for-federal-investigati) titled “Cassava Sciences Shares Fall Sharply Lower After STAT News Reports 'FDA calls for federal investigation into its controversial Alzheimer's drug approval'” Then, Benzinga revised their title to Cassava Sciences Shares Fall Sharply Lower After STAT News Reports 'FDA calls for federal investigation into \[Biogen's\] controversial Alzheimer's drug approval' 
3. Stat News Article - Adam Feurerstein, a writer for Stat news with  known history for bashing biotech (take a look at what he said about Moderna: [Tweet History](https://twitter.com/search?q=Moderna%20(from%3Aadamfeuerstein)%20until%3A2019-07-01%20-filter%3Areplies&amp;src=typed_query)) released this [article](https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/30/alzheimers-scientists-critique-cassava-sciences-study-results-overblown-inappropriate-uninterpretable/). I wrote a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/owd2pn/what_i_learned_investigating_sava_fud_spreaders/) exposing major conflict of interest for all 3 scientists he quoted (who he has previously quoted as well).
4. Lawsuit Announcement by Pomerantz - After SAVA was shorted down from 146 to 73, this law firm, released a [PR](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-investigates-claims-on-behalf-of-investors-of-cassava-sciences-inc---sava-301347716.html) claiming it is “investigating claims on behalf of investors” alleging possible securities fraud. The firm claims that Cassava’s PR was inappropriate because Cassava said its cognition data was positive (it is) but that Simufilam wasn’t proven to be more affective than Biogen’s Aduhelm (it was). 

The CEO has even recently made remarks about the price action in a recent earnings call, responding to unfair criticism. You can read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyvnm7/sava_the_biggest_blockbuster_in_pharmaceutical/).

**In my opinion**, SAVA is attracting so much bear attention because it represents a very real **David vs Goliath** threat to big pharmaceutical companies Biogen and Eli Lilly. I also believe that the deliberate or accidental misinformation and FUD campaigns will ultimately serve to benefit SAVA as investors (you retards) realize the full story of what is going on. 

Due to this recent price action following the release of positive 9 month open label data, I believe SAVA  provides an even better asymmetric risk opportunity. In other words, I think the stock is currently trading at a discount.

Positions: 3954 SAVA, $10c 01/21/22, $20c 01/21/22, $45c 01/21/22, $22.5c 01/20/23

# Addendum:

If the drug doesn’t work in 9 month, it will not work in p3. Let's construct a simple probability chart where we have 4 different possibilities and the probability of each possibility below:

||Works at 9 month OL |Doesn’t Work at 9 month OL |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Works in Phase 3 |0.05 |0|
|Doesn’t work in Phase 3 |0.15 |0.8|

In this example, **given** that Simufilam works for 9 month Open Label, it now has a much better chance of working in Phase 3. To illustrate this, we just cross out ""Doesn't Work at 9 month OL""

||Works at 9 month OL |~~Doesn’t Work at 9 month OL~~ |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Works in Phase 3 |0.05 |~~0~~|
|Doesn’t work in Phase 3 |0.15 |~~0.8~~|

Prior to knowing 9 month data, the drug has a 5% chance of working (sum the top two cells). After 9 month data it has a 0.05/(0.05+0.15) = 25% chance of working at phase three.",wallstreetbets,$SAVA Monster Writeup Part 3: Valuation,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1pjko/sava_monster_writeup_part_3_valuation/

Long term the company won’t fail, its too far along in the space it’s in with superior pricing along with movement in the right direction. The drawback is that it’s very slow moving, but the industry is also pretty high barriers to entry which they have already overcome and there is a very steep curve to being a household name.

Let me start by saying that the two companies that I am laying out I have active investment in, I’m a retail investor as well. 

1. Bombardier Inc. (BDRBF) 
2. Grupo Supervielle S.A. (SUPV)

Let’s start with number one. 

Bombardier is a plane manufacturer that specializes in smaller commercial/private jets. In 2018 they consolidated their business to specialize in only jet manufacturing. The positive side of the business is their growth, the company expects to deliver 120 new jets by the end of the year, and a brand new certified pre-owned program. The negative part of their business is the debt they have taken on. This negative presents the most value in my opinion. The current price of BDRBF is sitting around $1.36USD but the increase in debt servicing and the COVID era decrease in flights brought this from a company that should have a value of around $3.00 down to less than $0.50. Do your research, but this is a company worthy of a slice of your portfolio. 

Number 2

Grupo Superville S.A. (SUPV)

Imagine a Bank of America but for Argentina, and this is what you arrive at. The company has traded as high $30 per share but now sits at a measly $1.95 at the time of this writing. This has been entirely due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso and even more so by the coronavirus pandemic. My thought process is as the pandemic eventually ends, and the US is in need of valuable metals like copper, we will indeed be looking at options in the South American continent. Investment in Argentina will cause an increase in stock value like Grupo Superville.

You’re all probably thinking, “WTF why Crocs? Their clogs are so ugly!” (Ticker: $CROX)

Well, despite the fact that they may have some footwear that isn’t the most attractive, they as a business are doing incredibly well and I’m sure most of you can put your feelings aside if there's some upside potential.

Crocs has had a **very** volatile history as a publicly-traded stock. They nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis back in ‘08 but managed to survive. Their stock price was then pretty range-bound for nearly a decade before finally in the last few years started moving in the right direction.

Then during COVID, they seemed to gain some serious recognition through their support of [healthcare workers](https://www.crocs.com/COVID19-REQUEST.html) with free pairs of Crocs and they’ve continued their [celebrity endorsement](https://www.theindustry.fashion/crocs-sales-soar-on-the-back-of-celebrity-endorsements-and-this-summers-clogs-trend/) marketing campaign where celebrities like Justin Bieber have endorsed their brand.

Google Trends shows a solid uptick in terms of “Crocs” queries since January 2018.

However, regardless of endorsements, PR events, and other things a company does to drive up demand and awareness, what’s most important are the numbers. So let’s take a look at their most recent [earnings report from Q2](https://investors.crocs.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Crocs-Inc.-Reports-Record-Second-Quarter-Revenue-and-Commits-to-Net-Zero-Emissions-by-2030/default.aspx) (Released July 22, 2021): 

* Revenue grew **93.3% YoY** (a near double!) and 39% sequentially (QoQ)! That’s a **huge acceleration** from what was already a very strong Q1 report of 63.6% YoY.
* Non-GAAP Net Income **doubled** YoY and maintained the trend of 22% net income margins
* Non-GAAP EPS doubled from a year ago which means **their trailing twelve months of EPS is nearly triple** from what it was a year ago!
* Their shares outstanding also dropped 5% YoY from their accelerated share repurchases program, **so high EPS and share buybacks generally means more share appreciation**
* **Gross Margins increased by 600 basis points QoQ and 700+ basis points YoY to 61.7%,** for some context, 60%+ gross margins is REALLY high, especially for retail. Nike for example has 45.8% gross margins, Lululemon has 57.1% gross margins. Their gross margins have been ticking up since Q1 of last year
* Operating income came in at $195 M which represents **30% operating margins which is really good.** This is the highest operating margin they’ve ever in the past 5 years at leastt (as far as I looked).
* Their Wholesale business is on fire, in the Americas region, it increased **150% YoY** and APAC/EMEA weren’t too shabby at 76.4 and 82.6% respectively
* Their direct-to-consumer business is doing really well too. With Americas revenue going up 128% YoY. Their last 3 quarters of D2C Americas YoY growth were: 80.4%, 131.3% and 128.1%, so the second consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. In addition, what’s really encouraging is that their APAC and EMEA D2C businesses are starting to show some life with APAC which has been struggling since COVID turned out nearly 11% YoY growth and theiR EMEA business is now doing \~30% YoY growth. There is a huge opportunity for Crocs to expand internationally
* From a cash flow perspective, they **generated $212 M in cash flow which is really good seeing how they only generated $30 M last quarter and only $267 M in cash in ALL OF 2020.**
* ***GUIDANCE was 60-70% revenue growth for Q3*** **and 60-65% YoY revenue growth for 2021 which means Q4 will have 35% YoY revenue growth.** Since Crocs has historically beaten their revenue guidance, this means Crocs will stand to grow revenue 70%+ in 2021 and despite a tough comparison in Q4, will still stand to grow revenue by 35%+.

Let’s now talk about what management is thinking:

1. They are going to increase marketing spend and increase it a lot. The goal is to spend 7% of total revenue on marketing in the back half of Q2, which will likely amount to $100+ M assuming they keep up growth figures, this is a HUGE increase from their $28 M in marketing spend in Q1 &amp; Q2 combined.
2. They expect to see strong growth in all regions and in all channels as brand momentum continues.
3. They will have net zero emissions by 2030, so a lot of people who invest in ESG companies, this is a plus for Crocs
4. They expect the strong international growth to continue

Fundamentally, this is a company that just had a very strong Q2 where their stock increased another 10%+ the next day. Remember, this stock is up 100%+ YTD already, so a lot of share price appreciation has been priced in and yet it continues to impress with such strong earnings results.

Assuming Crocs continues to outperform their guidance which they have in the past 4 quarters, Crocs will continue to see big EPS gains which will continue to be a boost for the company’s share price.

As with any stock, there are risks:

1. COVID continues to be a problem and may impact their supply chain
2. They increased their LT debt to $386 M after issuing a $350 M note, this is the highest level of debt they’ve had in the past few years. We’re in a low-interest-rate environment, so this should be fine, but something to monitor
3. Inventories increased to $209 M which is the highest level of inventory the company has had in the past few years. Something to continue to monitor.
4. Their brand momentum may slow down which would slow down sales

Then during COVID, they seemed to gain some serious recognition through their support of [healthcare workers](https://www.crocs.com/COVID19-REQUEST.html) with free pairs of Crocs and they’ve continued their [celebrity endorsement](https://www.theindustry.fashion/crocs-sales-soar-on-the-back-of-celebrity-endorsements-and-this-summers-clogs-trend/) marketing campaign where celebrities like Justin Bieber have endorsed their brand.

Google Trends shows a solid uptick in terms of “Crocs” queries since January 2018.

 📷 

However, regardless of endorsements, PR events, and other things a company does to drive up demand and awareness, what’s most important are the numbers. So let’s take a look at their most recent [earnings report from Q2](https://investors.crocs.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Crocs-Inc.-Reports-Record-Second-Quarter-Revenue-and-Commits-to-Net-Zero-Emissions-by-2030/default.aspx) (Released July 22, 2021):

* Revenue grew **93.3% YoY** (a near double!) and 39% sequentially (QoQ)! That’s a **huge acceleration** from what was already a very strong Q1 report of 63.6% YoY.
* Non-GAAP Net Income **doubled** YoY and maintained the trend of 22% net income margins
* Non-GAAP EPS doubled from a year ago which means **their trailing twelve months of EPS is nearly triple** from what it was a year ago!
* Their shares outstanding also dropped 5% YoY from their accelerated share repurchases program, **so high EPS and share buybacks generally means more share appreciation**
* **Gross Margins increased by 600 basis points QoQ and 700+ basis points YoY to 61.7%,** for some context, 60%+ gross margins is REALLY high, especially for retail. Nike for example has 45.8% gross margins, Lululemon has 57.1% gross margins. Their gross margins have been ticking up since Q1 of last year
* Operating income came in at $195 M which represents **30% operating margins which is really good.** This is the highest operating margin they’ve ever in the past 5 years at leastt (as far as I looked).
* Their Wholesale business is on fire, in the Americas region, it increased **150% YoY** and APAC/EMEA weren’t too shabby at 76.4 and 82.6% respectively
* Their direct-to-consumer business is doing really well too. With Americas revenue going up 128% YoY. Their last 3 quarters of D2C Americas YoY growth were: 80.4%, 131.3% and 128.1%, so the second consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. In addition, what’s really encouraging is that their APAC and EMEA D2C businesses are starting to show some life with APAC which has been struggling since COVID turned out nearly 11% YoY growth and theiR EMEA business is now doing \~30% YoY growth. There is a huge opportunity for Crocs to expand internationally
* From a cash flow perspective, they **generated $212 M in cash flow which is really good seeing how they only generated $30 M last quarter and only $267 M in cash in ALL OF 2020.**
* ***GUIDANCE was 60-70% revenue growth for Q3*** **and 60-65% YoY revenue growth for 2021 which means Q4 will have 35% YoY revenue growth.** Since Crocs has historically beaten their revenue guidance, this means Crocs will stand to grow revenue 70%+ in 2021 and despite a tough comparison in Q4, will still stand to grow revenue by 35%+.

Let’s now talk about what management is thinking:

1. They are going to increase marketing spend and increase it a lot. The goal is to spend 7% of total revenue on marketing in the back half of Q2, which will likely amount to $100+ M assuming they keep up growth figures, this is a HUGE increase from their $28 M in marketing spend in Q1 &amp; Q2 combined.
2. They expect to see strong growth in all regions and in all channels as brand momentum continues.
3. They will have net zero emissions by 2030, so a lot of people who invest in companies, this is a plus for Crocs
4. They expect the strong international growth to continue

Fundamentally, this is a company that just had a very strong Q2 where their stock increased another 10%+ the next day. Remember, this stock is up 100%+ YTD already, so a lot of share price appreciation has been priced in and yet it continues to impress with such strong earnings results.

Assuming Crocs continues to outperform their guidance which they have in the past 4 quarters, Crocs will continue to see big EPS gains which will continue to be a boost for the company’s share price.

As with any stock, there are risks:

1. COVID continues to be a problem and may impact their supply chain
2. They increased their LT debt to $386 M after issuing a $350 M note, this is the highest level of debt they’ve had in the past few years. We’re in a low-interest-rate environment, so this should be fine, but something to monitor
3. Inventories increased to $209 M which is the highest level of inventory the company has had in the past few years. Something to continue to monitor.
4. Their brand momentum may slow down which would slow down sales

ALRIGHT RETARDS. This is the only $SAVA DD you'll need to read to understand how Simufilam works and the timeline of the research behind it. I broke it up into 3 parts so your tiny attention spans would be able to read it over time. This is the 2nd part, the part none of you want to read: **The science behind Simufilam.**

## TLDR:

1. Cassava Sciences is developing a new treatment for early to moderate stage Alzheimer’s called **Simufilam** and a diagnostic for Alzheimer’s Disease called **SavaDX**.
2. Cassava Sciences finished Phase 2 trials in September 2020 and are currently running Open Label trials. Cassava Sciences is starting Phase 3 trials in September 2021. Once Phase 3 trials are over, the FDA will decide on whether or not to approve Simufilam. I believe Simufilam’s Phase 2 and Open Label trial data are extremely promising - patients who are currently testing it are actually getting better.

# Cassava Sciences, Simufilam, and SavaDX

Cassava Sciences is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Its mission is to develop a treatment and diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease.

Simufilam is a proprietary, small molecule oral (pill) drug that restores the normal shape and function of altered Filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein, in the brain. Altered FLNA in the brain disrupts the normal function of neurons, leading to Alzheimer’s pathology, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Simufilam is protected by patents.

SavaDx is an investigational blood test to detect Alzheimer’s disease. SavaDX is protected by trade secrets.

# Timeline of Drug Discovery and Research

1. 2012 - Preclinical Studies [\[1\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22815492/)
   1. Cassava Sciences published “Reducing amyloid-related Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by a small molecule targeting filamin A”. In this paper, they show that Filamin A is required in the toxic signaling of amyloid-beta by the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which results in tau phosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. They show that a new small molecule compound they discovered, called PTI-125 binds strongly to misfolded Filamin A. In this study, they used mouse models and postmortem human brain tissue.
2. 2017 - Preclinical Studies [\[1\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28438486/),[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22815492/)
   1. Cassava Sciences published “PTI-125 binds and reverses an altered conformation of filamin A to reduce Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis”. In this paper they show that Amyloid Beta causes Filamin A to deform and induce associations with α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Since PTI-125 binds strongly to Filamin A, it restores the original function of this scaffolding protein in the brain and prevents negative downstream effects. This trial used mice and human brain samples.

1. 2020 - Phase 2a Trial Results [\[1\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920628/)
   1. Cassava Science published a paper “PTI-125 Reduces Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Patients'' describing the results of a phase 2a study. The objective of this study is to assess the Safety of PTI-125 and measure its effects on biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma for 28 days. This study included 13 mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients, age 50-85, Mini Mental State Exam ≥16 and ≤24 with a cerebrospinal fluid total tau/Aβ42 ratio ≥0.30. PTI-125 oral tablets (100 mg) were administered twice daily for 28 consecutive days. PTI-125 reduced cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation from baseline to Day 28.
2. 2020 - Phase 2b Trial
   1. The design of the trial was as follows: Phase 2b was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical study of sumifilam (formerly, PTI-125). Sixty-four patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, age 50-85, were randomized (1:1:1) to 100 mg or 50 mg oral sumifilam or matching placebo. Treatment was administered twice daily for 28 days. Nine U.S. study sites enrolled patients. A clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease was confirmed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥16 to ≤26 and a CSF T-tau/Aβ42 ratio ≥0.28. Safety was assessed by ECGs, clinical labs, adverse event monitoring and physical examinations.
   2. On May 15, 2020, Cassava [reported](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/top-line-results-phase-2b-study-pti-125-alzheimers-disease-does) that they missed their primary endpoint in their Phase 2b trial. However, upon further analysis, they realized that the lab that ran their data made a mistake. (Lot of bears shit on the company for this reason, FUD in my opinion)
   3. On September 14, 2020, Cassava [reported](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-final-results-phase-2b-clinical-study) final results for their phase 2b trial. 2021 - Open Label Trial. They reported that the drug was safe and well-tolerated, and that they met primary endpoints for biomarker data. They also showed improvement in cognition via the CANTAB test.

[Compared to placebo, biomarker data shows improvement across all biomarkers](https://preview.redd.it/5uabfv8wz8g71.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=732c1ca492eb7b9fb049974cf6e45f1886930c9c)

1. 2021 - Ongoing Open Label Trial
   1. 9 month Data was [presented](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-positive-cognition-data-simufilam) to AAIC: 

[CSF Biomarkers continued to improve](https://preview.redd.it/xwl5qcwyz8g71.png?width=2558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc4c3eee4525c0c7123406ec24f44551835869a)

[88&amp;#37; of patients responded](https://preview.redd.it/z5g3imwyz8g71.png?width=2564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7a118697f1c07826f335e4a185aff3c27c9d81e)

[Cognition improved from 6 to 9 month Open Label](https://preview.redd.it/tspxulwyz8g71.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e81094500ce82430795757b09a18cc2b548e84b4)

Comparing 6 month Biomarker data to 2b biomarker data, while not academically sound, shows ***increasing*** effects on biomarkers. 

# Conclusions:

1. SAVA has conducted preclinical trials, placebo controlled phase 2a trials, and placebo controlled phase 2b trials. Phase 2 trials have enough participants to show that Simufilam is **safe and well-tolerated.**
2. SAVA is conducting an Open Label (non placebo controlled) trial. This trial just completed 150 patients enrolled. [\[source\]](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-positive-cognition-data-simufilam) They reported increasing 6 and 9 month cognition data on the first 50 patients, because the first 50 patients are the ones they have data for.
3. Placebo effects for Alzheimer's are most significant early on. Therefore, when data is released about 6 month and 9 month results, any placebo effect we should see is diminishing. 
4. Two phase 3 studies are planned: the first is 12 months 600 patients placebo controlled testing for **cognition improvement,** the second is 18 months with 1000 patients placebo controlled testing for **cognition maintenance**. [\[recent slides\]](https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/a518d6f8-be82-4a23-b676-e8b5a75cf9e6) [\[old announcement\]](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-positive-end-phase-2-meeting-fda-and) Note that they actually switched the order of these two phase 3 studies (they firsts announced 18 month trial for maintenance will be first). My wife's psychic says this is a bullish sign of confidence as the company wants to complete the more challenging 12 month **improvement** trial first.
5. Placebo groups for Alzheimer's in previous trials do not show increasing cognition at 9 months. For example, this is what the Aricept trial looked like: [\[source\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13754762_Donepezil_Use_in_Alzheimer_Disease)

[Note placebo effect wears off after 12 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/zoalmx616cg71.jpg?width=764&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5a6bf284e89b436902d7e32f7867a60580e9a2)

Firstly, forgive me in advance for the rambling nonsense I’m about to write out since I need to get around the dumb auto—mod who is going to remove my post for being 0 IQ. 

 $MQ - Marqeta has earnings this week, and I’m bullshit only because no one here has talked about $MQ at all. They’re also in a boring fucking industry, credit processing, which indicates that no one thinks about going and making a meme stock out of it. They have some pretty solid fundamentals — and the clients they’re working with include Uber, JPMorgan Chase, DoorDash, etc. They’re also going to be helping Goldman Sachs ($GS), (who is making a shit ton of money and outperforming the market, as-is) open their checking accounts before the end of the year, same thing for Affirm, who is going to eventually provide a “Buy now pay later” card that’ll be able to be used on ANY purchase, not only those available on the Affirm platform. Once Marqeta has these companies as clients, the don’t enough of a shit to go and find other card issuing solutions, since Marqeta does it all. 

[Marqeta’s website](https://www.marqeta.com) alone is more than enough to give me confidence that they know what they’re doing. I have no idea how credit processing works, other than that there is minimal risk for the card issuers and much more risk for both the merchant as well as the banks/those providing capital/money. 

Since MQ is into card/digital issuing, there’s minimal risk and downtime for consumers who fall for credit card fraud — they’re able to be issued new cards instantly, with new card numbers, which they can use right away. Plastic will be a thing of the past within a few years. According to Google and some bullshit [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/) article, in 2019, over 65% of US retail merchants accepted Apple Pay (and other NFC/digital payments). 
Additionally, 74 of the top 100 merchants accepted Apple Pay. Marqeta also recently partnered with Google to provide cards for their [GooglePay](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210729005273/en/%C2%A0Marqeta-To-Power-Virtual-Google-Pay-Balance-Card) platform. This will make MQ even more valuable, since consumers can get an account and start spending instantly, both online and in person.

To recap: MQ is working with Uber, Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Affirm, and other big companies to, what is likely, permanently provide card issuing solutions for them. They literally cannot lose money. The stock is also on sale right now. Earnings estimates are expected to be negative — they’re probably going to blow past it even if it is still negative, it’ll be free money. If they go positive, this will print. So now I ask: what is the play? Weeklies are available only for next week, so 8/20 $30c ?

ER is Thursday after the close

Spot: $149.88 / 52w High $219

Thesis:

WFA (Work from Anywhere) became a huge trend this spring and summer as people got vaccinated (Jan-Apr) and weren't required to go into the office. I believe TONS of people took advantage of this with pent up demand for domestic travel (international restrictions still apply in many areas). 

Enter AirBNB, the clear-cut leader in the rent-someone-else's-home space (nice try, VRBO). They are commanding a huge market share with the most valuable demographics, and many businesses are now allowing business travel to expense AirBNB's -- recognizing that hotels are just one option. 

RE investors are a tailwind: with home prices at ATH, there's a throng of younger RE investors that have been buying/rehabbing/renting properties in high-demand cities. There's a whole ecosystem building around property management, cleaning, and listing for AirBNB owners. Low rates = lots of new supply. 

I think this is the ER that the business opens people's eyes after their version of the COVID-19 full house (kind of like PTON last year).

**Preamble**

Hedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry’s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \[1\].

Even with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&amp;text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \[2\], it begs the question

**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**

**Data**

The individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \[3\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \[4\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.

This dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.

**Result**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)

S&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \[5\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.

This awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.

[ ](https://i.redd.it/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)

If you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.

The catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!

**Warren Buffet’s take of Hedge Funds**

In 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter

&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.

Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter

While I don’t completely agree with this view that it’s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \[6\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500‘s \~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!

**An alternative view**

It would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,

[ ](https://i.redd.it/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)

Given that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?

The answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)

The above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.

In the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.

This chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \[7\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry’s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \[8\].

While you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100’s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don’t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI’s.

Even if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.

What this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI’s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!

\[2\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you’ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.

\[3\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!

\[4\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it’s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.

\[5\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.

\[6\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.

\[7\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.

\[8\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).

JPow’s time at the Fed is coming to an end with his term expiring in February 2022. Biden will not renominate him as Chair and instead will nominate Lael Brainard. Lael Brainard is a current Fed Governor and was nominated as a Governor in 2012 along with JPow. Since many of you enjoyed my post on China, I thought I may share my thoughts on the Fed. 

1. Spending is politically popular. Politicians are only focused on the next election, whether it be a House or Senate seat, or even the Presidency. The level of deficit spending the US currently engages in would not be possible unless the Fed agrees to purchase the issuance by Treasury. While the Fed may call this QE, it is not. This is monetizing deficits (or money printing) because the Fed is buying new Treasury issuance from a broker dealer immediately after it buy them from Treasury auctions (for those who don’t know broker deals are required to bid on Treasury auctions). Janet Yellen wants JPow to buy as much Treasury bonds as possible as the market does not want this negative yielding asset (it is negative yielding because of high inflation currently). This is seen through the 120Bn in monthly purchases (80Bn treasury bonds, 40Bn MBS). 

2. Biden has said publicly he wishes to elevate women or people of color. JPow is neither of those. He is a 68 year old white dude with years of Wall Street experience as MP at the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is a private equity firm founded by David Rubenstein in the mid 1980s. 

3. JPow is trying to simp for the job. I have watched JPow for many years and have noticed recently he has changed his tune. He now seems to care about regulating Wall Street, climate change, and income inequality. These views were absent during the Trump administration. JPow has also expressed an interest in running the economy hot (with high inflation) to ensure a full job recovery. This directly contradicts his actions in 2018 where he was only interested in raising interest rates at the first sign of inflation. 

4. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, shares many of the same views as Progressives. She is a woman and a Democrat, where JPow is a Republican. Most importantly, she is publicly calling for the Fed to adopt a digital Dollar, which is in direct conflict with her colleagues. Brainard joined the Fed in 2012 (the same time as JPow) and has a good relationship with Janet Yellen. Under Brainard’s leadership the Fed would be less likely to taper, if at all. This would allow the Fed to continue to monetize deficits which would allow for more politically popular spending.

I have no positions in the market other than a SPAC I am going to redeem. The rest of my assets are in cash. JPow will be told whether he has the job in September, although I am still staying on the sidelines after being burned in Chinese stocks.",wallstreetbets,Jerome Powell Will Not Be Renominated As Fed Chairman,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0fsmf/jerome_powell_will_not_be_renominated_as_fed/

1. Many businesses in US depend on China. We may not be familiar with the names of the many SMEs in US that depends on or benefits from China’s cheaper production costs but we most likely have heard of the big names such as Tesla, Apple, Gillette, Levi’s, Barbie dolls, Ray Bans, Nike, Converse etc and the list goes on and on.
2. Game theory. US is not likely to fuck themselves, their economy and China is not going to fuck themselves either, exiting from such a large market. Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation.
3. If for any reason that the size of their genitals matters more to them than their economies and people, we must remember that the rest of world gets fucked as well. This shit could cause a recession that spreads faster than a STD in college, so that’s additional protection (pun fully intended).

TallReplacement229,t2_4trxv54d,1628436229,p0gm4s,True,224,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0gm4s/why_viac_is_better_than_nflx_and_dis_prove_me/,1,"Hey Apes, this DD is a continuation to these Great DDs I found on wallstreetbets: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac_god_tier_way_too_long_dd_all_aboard_the_p/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz5jd8/viac_has_great_momentum_while_extremely/)

**Let me start off with few basic things. ViacomCBS has had a great Q2 with some key highlights:**

* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)
* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)
* \+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)
* \+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)
* \+45% watch time per user (Roku's decreased)
* \+24% ad revenue yoy
* \+9% affiliate revenue yoy
* \+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy. In comparison, $NFLX +19.4% stream revenue yoy (Revenue growth stagnating and is flattening out)
* Paramount+ [launches](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-plus-australia-nz-launch-1234949704/) in Australia and New Zealand on 11th August (in 3 days yey!!!!!)
* Paramount+ [officially launches in Europe](https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/viacomcbs-sky-paramount-plus-europe-launch-1235035254/) in 2022, expands in South America

**ViacomCBS Paramount+ is experiencing unprecedented subscriber growth in post-pandemic quarters Q1 and Q2 across streaming industry**, where net Adds in Q2 (6.5 million) exceeded Q1 (6.0 million), which I believe nobody expected even in their most bullish scenarios. 

[Global Subscriber Count for major streaming giants \(US + rest of the world combined\)](https://preview.redd.it/awpws6tpd5g71.png?width=2082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e480f224ef3a844b07e5363bab7c9ba17313372)

Key highlight is that Paramount Plus Quarter-over-Quarter growth is in 20% range in the first 2 quarters of 2021, while Netflix is experiencing a 1.3% subscriber growth, so basically becoming a value stock instead of being a growth stock. Also Disney's subscriber growth is slowing down dramatically as well to 7.67% average growth for the Q1 and Q2 2021 quarters. 

**Diversity of Content and Subscription price**

[Subscribers, Subscription price and Content Diversity](https://preview.redd.it/y9bhzi9ei5g71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcd64f035639a3aeef99bae6059f2ac5ed09b64f)

In conclusion, ViacomCBS Paramount+  is expanding into more countries in 2022 with total of 60 countries including Europe, Australia, etc, and Paramount+ subscriber growth has not yet reached its peak as Yellowstone [prequel](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/yellowstone-prequel-series-paramount-plus-taylor-sheridan-viacomcbs-deal-1234901944/) and potentially Yellowstone itself including Season 4 is coming to Paramount+ later this year; Also recent $900 million deal with South Park creators with 14 South Park films in next 7 years streaming exclusively on Paramount Plus where 2 South Park movies coming later this year!!!! ALSO ALSO, Star trek new seasons and tv shows coming this year, as well as Avatar The Last Airbender new [shows](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix) and new movies coming exclusively to P+, as original creators, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, are joining Nickelodeon as co-chief creative officers of Avatar Studios. ALL OF THIS SHOWS ViacomCBS commitment to P+ and make it the TOP 3  or even Number 1 streaming platform globally

Therefore $VIAC should actually be valued like a growth stock with P/E = 15-20 which equals to $80-$100, instead of 7.79 P/E [currently](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VIAC?p=VIAC). While $NFLX should be actually a Value stock or Shiittyy stock with P/E of 10, instead of P/E=[53.9](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX?p=NFLX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).

Also Paramount+ is the cheapest in the industry with only 4.99$ and has huge amount of quality content (CBS, Nickelodeon, BET, SHOWTIME, Smithsonian, Paramount Network, MTV, Comedy Central) while the rest of streaming platforms subscription is like around 8$-10$ and does not have enough good content to justify it. Also who da faq still subscribed to NFLX? THere is like nothing to watch there...

Crocs (CROX) has been booming like crazy since the pandemic and the stock price has gone through the moon. But did you know that it still can go to Mars. Hold you horses. I know your dick is getting hard but bear with me.

Crocs is shoe company that consists of brands such as ""Clogs"", ""Sandals"", ""Jibbitz charms"", and ""LiteRite"". The vast majority of Crocs shoes features Croslite material, a proprietary technology that makes users feel comfortable in their shoes. And people, especially these poor Gen Z and millennials buy these products like there is no tomorrow.

Crocs has been partnering up with celebrities such as Justin Bieber and most of these collaboration products are sold out.

Crocs has Wholesale, Retail, and Ecommerce as ""Distribution Channels"". Wholesale accounted 50.0% of revenue in 2020. Wholesale channel includes domestic and international, multi-brand, brick-and-mortar, e-tailors, and distributors in certain countries. Retail accounted 24.1% of revenue in 2020. Retail channel operated through 3 platforms. Company-operated full price retail stores, outlet stores, and store-in-store locations. Ecommerce accounted 25.9% of revenue in 2020.

Andrew Rees joined Crocs as President in June 2014 and became CEO and joined the Board of Directors in June 2017. He is just the CEO I am looking for. This guy knows the company's operating and culture. He has more than 25 years of experience in the footwear and retail industry. Prior to Crocs, he served as Managing Director of L.E.K Consulting in Boston where he founded and led the firm's Retail and Consumer Products Practice for 13 years. While at L.E.K, Rees served as a consultant for Crocs from 2013 to 2014, supporting the development and execution of the company's strategic growth plan.

ALRIGHT RETARDS. This is the only $SAVA DD you'll need to read to understand what's going on with Alzheimer's research. I broke it up into 3 parts so your tiny attention spans would be able to read it over time. This is the first part, the part none of you think is necessary: **Necessary Background Knowledge.**

## TLDR:

1. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia. 50 Million people worldwide and 5.8 Million in the United States have Alzheimer’s. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s and no way to definitively diagnose it. Untreated, people with Alzheimer’s always get worse.
2. Current treatments (Aduhelm, Aricept) suck as they only **slow the decline** of patients with Alzheimer’s. Current diagnostic methods suck for Alzheimer’s because they involve a multistep process of family interviews, brain scans, or memory/cognition tests.

# Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet

* Alzheimer's is the **most common cause of dementia**. 
* Alzheimer's is a **progressive disease**, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. [\[source\]](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers)
* The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age. Alzheimer's is the **sixth-leading cause of death in the United States**. [\[source\]](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet)
* **6.2 Million Americans** have Alzheimer's. By 2050, the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer’s dementia is projected to reach **12.7 million in the US**. As the size and proportion of the U.S. population aged 65 and older continue to increase, the number of Americans with Alzheimer’s or other dementias will grow. This number will escalate rapidly in coming years, as the population of Americans age 65 and older is projected to grow from 55 million in 2019 to 88 million by 2050. The baby boom generation has already begun to reach age 65 and beyond, the age range of greatest risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. [\[source\]](https://www.alz.org/media/documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf)
* More than 18.5 Billion hours of informal care were provided by Alzheimer's and other dementia caregivers in 2018, a contribution to the nation valued at nearly $234 billion. The total lifetime cost of care for someone with dementia was estimated at $350,174 in 2018 dollars. The costs associated with family care make up 70 percent of lifetime dementia care costs. [\[source\]](https://www.alz.org/media/documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf)
* **Alzheimer's has no cure**. Treatments include Aducanumab, and Aricept (cholinesterase inhibitor). Aricept is an old drug that can **temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms** and improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers [\[source\]](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048103).  Aducanumab, recently approved by the FDA, is [highly controversial](https://time.com/6081333/biogen-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-fda-controversy/) as it was approved **without indication that it improved cognition in patients**.
* **Alzheimer’s is best diagnosed early**, since all treatments are for early-to-moderate Alzheimer’s [\[article\]](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/why-get-checked). Doctors [diagnose Alzheimer's disease](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-dementia-symptoms-types-and-diagnosis) using in person tests administered to assess memory and thinking skills. Laboratory and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes or help the doctor better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is only diagnosed with complete certainty after death, when microscopic examination of the brain reveals the Amyloid plaques and Tau tangles.

# Amyloid Hypothesis and Tau Tangles

Beta-amyloid is a sticky compound that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells and eventually killing them. Some researchers believe that flaws in the processes governing production, accumulation or disposal of beta-amyloid are the primary cause of Alzheimer’s. This theory is called “the amyloid hypothesis.” [\[source\]](https://www.alz.org/national/documents/topicsheet_betaamyloid.pdf) Amyloid plaques are hard, insoluble accumulations of beta-amyloid proteins that clump together between the nerve cells (neurons) in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients. [\[source\]](https://www.brightfocus.org/alzheimers-disease/infographic/amyloid-plaques-and-neurofibrillary-tangles)

Aducanumab (Biogen) and Donanemab (Eli Lilly) are monoclonal antibodies that target beta-amyloid in soluble and insoluble form. These drugs seek to remove amyloid plaques from the brain. Unfortunately, while they have been shown to reduce amyloid from the brain, they have not been shown to improve cognition. Both drugs are administered via IV infusion. [\[source\]](https://www.centerwatch.com/directories/1067-fda-approved-drugs/listing/4716-aduhelm-aducanumab-avwa)

Tau tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's, are insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain's cells. These tangles consist primarily of [a protein called tau](https://www.brightfocus.org/alzheimers-disease/article/tau-protein-and-alzheimers-disease-whats-connection). In Alzheimer's disease, the tau protein is abnormal and misfolded.

# Cassava Sciences, Simufilam, and SavaDX

Cassava Sciences (SAVA) is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Its mission is to develop a treatment and diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease.

Simufilam is a proprietary, small molecule oral (pill) drug that restores the normal shape and function of altered Filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein, in the brain. Altered FLNA in the brain disrupts the normal function of neurons, leading to Alzheimer’s pathology, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.  Importantly, Simufilam does not attempt to target amyloid-beta and remove it from the brain. Simufilam is protected by patents running till 2037.

SavaDx is an investigational blood test to detect Alzheimer’s disease. SavaDX is protected by trade secrets.

TTCF entered Target at the end of Q1 and smashed earnings without the boost of Target sales.  They had the best frozen food launch in Target's history and have a full quarter of Target sales. 

TTCF has now entered Kroger and will continue to added to more Kroger locations. 

NO short story here bitches, but it is shorted. 


Super low IV, IV in the 50%'s unheard of in meme stocks They have an absolute Chad of a CEO who has worked in food business for over 35 years and his daughter is creative designer of the food products

I'm no Wolfy but this has all the ingredients of a perfect ground floor meme stock with disgustingly low IV​

The Brand

Tattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding. You might be thinking to yourself right now I'm tired of this plant based shit I don't even care if the burger is still Moo'ing on the plate, but hang with me this industry is experiencing huge growth as the younger generations eat this stuff up.

​

Finances

For full year 2021, Tattooed Chef updated its guidance and expects:

Revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58 to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance excludes any revenue contribution from the Karsten facility which is currently not in operation. The Company expects to update guidance when production begins at that facility in the coming months. Gross margin in the range of 20% to 25% Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2 million to $4 million TTCF has a current market cap of 1.89B Insiders own 38% of the company​

Advertising and Social Media Presence

They've spent like 0 dollars on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars and they have already built up a loyal following. You can see on Twitter posts of pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like ""yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock"" and ""when you gonna be in Europe please"". They have a very popular product that is flying off the shelves. Before 2021, their only sales team was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, like an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager to boost marketing.

Expansion into Overseas Markets

Europe has a strong demand for their products, as plant-based proteins are growing in popularity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. It's cheaper for them to ship ingredients from Italy to the US for their US operations. So they're looking to hire sales in Europe to get TTCF in stores there. They have already entered into Costco UK and are expanding over the continent

​

Short Interest and Low IV

TTCF has very low IV and SI of over 30%. It is currently one of the most shorted stocks on the market. This is a stock with solid fundamentals and rapid growth. In my opinion calls are not priced accordingly and you seeing this early could get in on the ground floor while IV is still laughably low. Volume on it is low as well and the float is on the smaller side. If you are able to get in while IV is low this thing could take off.

#**If this giant wall of analysis is too long, there's a tl;dr at the end**

I am writing to you today to discuss some technical analysis of the stock and why I believe this current trading channel we are locked into may be seeing an end in the near future, and that some mega price movement may be on the way. **All of these opinions are my own, they are for entertainment purposes only, and none of this is financial advice in any regard.** This is nothing but pure conjecture based on my smooth-ass brain smashing keys and mouse clicks while drawing with crayons.


#Evidence 1. MACD 

Our MACD very low, and the 12 Day EMA very recently crossed over the 26 Day EMA. This is, for us, historically bullish. Let's take a look at history, and look at [this chart with my terrible marker crayon drawings.](https://i.imgur.com/TbGGZvZ.png)

August 28th, 2020: MACD crosses above the signal line, with a price of $10.43. October 5th, 2020: the last day with the MACD above the signal line, the price closes at $12.68, after seeing a highest peak of $13.22 during the run up for the month of September. **$2.79 (+27%) climb in price between bottom and top**

November 4th, 2020: the MACD crosses above the signal line, after a month of being below. The price fell from $12.68 down to $10.06 during the decline, with $9.87 being the lowest point of the run. January 8th, 2021: the last day before the MACD falls below the signal line, the runup lasted two months, and closed the day on $15.90, after a new ATH of set $17.45 during the stretch. **$7.58 (+76%) climb in price between top and bottom**

January 9th 2021 to February 3rd, the price remains stable in a channel between $16.84 and $13.10, mostly trading sideways. 

February 4th, the Hindenberg report is unveiled and the price drops $1.72 the next day, from $13.95 down to $12.23 at close. For the next month, the price continues to plummet down to as low as $6.31. (MACD still under signal line)

March 11th,  brings sweet salvation, as the MACD crosses over at the price of $8.67 for the day and it continues in strong momentum for two months until May 5th. During the run, the price went from as low as $7.19 to as high as $10.17, **for a maximum gain of $2.98 (+41%) between the top and bottom prices**.

May 27th, the MACD again climbs above the signal line with a closing price of $7.83. It is only twelve days later that this MACD climb sends CLOV from the depths of $7.83, up to the new ATH price of $28.85, before later falling down below the signal line on June 17th (20~ days), **with a maximum gain of $21.02 (*+368%!!!*) since the crossover**. 

Now, this brings us to today. On August 2nd, our MACD crossed above the signal line again, and we have continued to remain above it (with increasing distance between the lines!). In the previous instances we've examined, the time between the MACD crossing above the signal line and below has lasted as little as 20 days and as long as about two months. **In every case of the crossing, we have seen an overall price gain, with a minimum of $27% gain between peaks of the run**. The last time we had this crossing, we had a fat, juicy gamma squeeze taking us to to stratosphere, but not quite the moon. 

We are now here again, above the signal line, in the early stages of gaining momentum. Every time prior, we have seen gains, and the gains have continued to be big each time that no one should sneeze at. If this trend holds up, we should see momentum carry us beyond the $8.50 line of resistance we are facing, and push us into some higher values where we don't know what to expect... or do we?

#Evidence 2. Bollinger Bands

Now if you don't know, Bollinger Bands (BB's) are an interesting type of technical indicator that are used to help determine overbought/oversold stock, and they also have a fantastic capacity to show price consolidation and anticipate breakouts. Essentially, the BB's calculate using EMA's that help determine movements of standard deviation for the stock, such that when a stock is overbought or oversold, you're outside the scope of the bands and there's a chance to make a play. 

What happens, however, is during moments of strong consolidation, the bands for the stock get very tight, because there's almost no fluctuation in price. What this does is create [""squeeze"" signals](https://i.imgur.com/HTwl22w.png), anticipating that there may be a strong breakout in the stock (in either direction) in the imminent future. What do CLOV BB's look like? I'm glad you asked. 

[Take a look at this chart with yet more terrible crayon drawings because I won't pay for a premium service to allow me extra charts and my current one I use is covered in even more crayon shit you don't want to see and I don't want to show you.](https://i.imgur.com/zN192TN.png)

Similar to how the MACD provides a strong indicator for bullish momentum in a stock, our Bollinger Bands are telling the same story in every piece of consolidation. **Every time our bands get tight, we move up**. What are we seeing right now? Our bands are getting tight after some pretty wild frequencies. 

#Evidence 3. RSI

Another fundamental trading tool, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) helps us measure rates of a stock being oversold or overbought in a perspective of momentum. This oscillating graph draws with crayons in a chart with values between 100 and 0, helping us see when stocks are being overbought (with a value of &gt;70) or oversold (&lt;30). The RSI is a kind of fascinating tool to watch because it *can* (not always) be predictive of human behavior, and can signal when long term or even momentary price changes are incoming. 

Well the RSI is important to us because it was not too many days ago that we hit [RSI values below 30, signaling to the world that we are very oversold.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/clover-health-investments-is-now-oversold-clov-2021-07-27) It doesn't take a brain to see it with the price, but the MACD similarly showed this heavily negative sentiment as it declined. 

The good news is that more often than not, once a stock starts breaking into oversold territory, it's likely due to rebound in the opposite direction in the near future. **In the case of CLOV, every approach (and breach) of oversold has reduced in a reversal and strong buying sentiment within a few months**. Exciting, bullish news. 

#Evidence 4. Price Stability and Short Scarcity
We've been trading sideways for what feels like an eternity. We have spent fourteen of the last 16 trading days moving sideways between the prices of $7.67 and $8.59. We had a momentary breakout for two days in the middle of this, before we were sent back down fast and hard. And even with the current price, the stock is doing remarkably well maintaining that $8 line for the most part. Although we have fallen below $8 11 times within the last 16 trading days, **we have only finished below $8 once**. 

At this time, Ortex is showing about a 90% utilization rate of the current shorts available, and a 22% SI. With utilization at that high of a level, overall, shorts are fairly thin, but not as thin as I'd like it to be. Yet, even with all of the weird price action and fuckery and short availability, investors are still maintaining this $8 support line very, very well. For the current utilization rate of shorts, and how well our price is doing, we have a strong backbone growing that appears to be giving us a lot of strength as we approach what looks to be a potential bullish run. I expect that the amount of shorts that do exist will probably be used to fight us on the way up, but the supply at this time seems to be generally limited. 

#Circumstantial Evidence: Social Sentiment
After our last runup, we got a lot of attention from people. Our membership since my time of joining months ago has moved from 6,000 to now 40,000 members. We are known and talked about as a short squeeze candidate by the media. We are known on Reddit. We have a big movement with our beloved YouTubes who are spreading awareness of the stock on Twitter, Stocktwits, YouTube, and elsewhere. **We are definitely not nobody at this moment.** There is, in my opinion, a powerful audience of people who could be eager at the chance to hear of some intense price movement in this volatile stock of ours, and we definitely have the reach to spread the word fast in the event of a bullish runaway. 

#Conclusion
Some of this might be some real amateur analysis to some of you, and if it is, that's okay. What I am seeing here are four powerful pieces of tangible evidence that are all pointing towards a potential bullish run in the incoming based on the following:

1. Every MACD crossover the stock has had up to this date has proved itself to be gainful. **We are just now in the crossover.**

2. Every MACD crossover has seen nice returns in a relatively short span of time, with gains as high as 368% (gamma squeeze) within about 20 days, to as low as 27% across two months. **Our stock is much more volatile and observed now than it was when we gained 27% in two months. If we see movement, I expect we will see movement *fast*.**

3. Every Bollinger Band's (BB's) contraction has lead to bullish momentum and outbreak in the time leading out of the contraction. **We entering a tightening contraction.**

4. Every BB's contraction has been coupled with a recent cross above the MACD Signal Line. **We are entering a BB's contraction with a recent cross above the MACD signal line.**

5. Our RSI is moving from oversold into the direction of overbought. **Buying momentum is on our side**. 

6. Every time the CLOV RSI has approached (or touched) the Oversold status, we have had buying momentum carry us into the bull run. **We are due to swing into heavy buying territory with the RSI at its current level.**

7. Our social media presence is big and people are interested. **If price movement gets volatile, there will very likely be crowds ready to get in. (Can anyone say, ""Opportunity for a gamma squeeze?""**

Take all of this together, and what do we get? A strong historical trend of a stock that has shown itself to run positive when technical indicators align, and they can do this in predictive, consistent patterns. The MACD is bullish. The RSI is bullish. The Bollinger's Bands are bullish. The price stability and support level is bullish. 

Every time these indicators align, the stock sees upwards movement within weeks to months. I don't know about you guys, but with the fuckery of 20 million FTD's, high SI%, high short utilization, and all of these bullish signals, in my non-financial advice opinion, **this seems like a stock that's ready to run and it's only a matter of time.** This screams mega-bullish to me. 

What happens with earnings upcoming here could be interesting. It could either catalyze or it could really hurt us depending on the aftermath. I'm inclined to think that if there's a negative reaction, it can only be *so* strong because many of current CLOV holders bought above current prices and selling doesn't make much of a difference. I really do not know who else would be selling the stock in a situation like this, because we do appear to be essentially bottoming out in terms of price. If there is a negative response to earnings, my hope is that holders will maintain the $8 support line. 

#TL;DR
In summary, a lot of positive technical indicators that have always shown growth for CLOV are aligning. I am expecting a price upswing in the coming weeks because of this, and further, because of our delicate social situation, I think there is a chance that there is a possibility for FOMO and/or a Gamma Squeeze because of the interest of onlookers. People *know* this stock wants to short squeeze, and those who want to play the odds may buy options on the way up. Statistically speaking, we are going to climb full dollar amounts, because every time these technical indicators align, we have (so far). Who knows how hard or fast this will go, but I am personally expecting that we will be breaking this $8-8.50 trading channel soon in the coming days/weeks, and there may be a metric shit ton of momentum that awaits to give us a kick once we do. Let's see how earnings goes first. **BULLISH AS FUCK.**

January 9th 2021 to February 3rd, the price remains stable in a channel between $16.84 and $13.10, mostly trading sideways. 

February 4th, the Hindenberg report is unveiled and the price drops $1.72 the next day, from $13.95 down to $12.23 at close. For the next month, the price continues to plummet down to as low as $6.31. (MACD still under signal line)

March 11th,  brings sweet salvation, as the MACD crosses over at the price of $8.67 for the day and it continues in strong momentum for two months until May 5th. During the run, the price went from as low as $7.19 to as high as $10.17, **for a maximum gain of $2.98 (+41%) between the top and bottom prices**.

May 27th, the MACD again climbs above the signal line with a closing price of $7.83. It is only twelve days later that this MACD climb sends CLOV from the depths of $7.83, up to the new ATH price of $28.85, before later falling down below the signal line on June 17th (20~ days), **with a maximum gain of $21.02 (*+368%!!!*) since the crossover**. 

Now, this brings us to today. On August 2nd, our MACD crossed above the signal line again, and we have continued to remain above it (with increasing distance between the lines!). In the previous instances we've examined, the time between the MACD crossing above the signal line and below has lasted as little as 20 days and as long as about two months. **In every case of the crossing, we have seen an overall price gain, with a minimum of $27% gain between peaks of the run**. The last time we had this crossing, we had a fat, juicy gamma squeeze taking us to to stratosphere, but not quite the moon. 

We are now here again, above the signal line, in the early stages of gaining momentum. Every time prior, we have seen gains, and the gains have continued to be big each time that no one should sneeze at. If this trend holds up, we should see momentum carry us beyond the $8.50 line of resistance we are facing, and push us into some higher values where we don't know what to expect... or do we?

#Evidence 2. Bollinger Bands

Now if you don't know, Bollinger Bands (BB's) are an interesting type of technical indicator that are used to help determine overbought/oversold stock, and they also have a fantastic capacity to show price consolidation and anticipate breakouts. Essentially, the BB's calculate using EMA's that help determine movements of standard deviation for the stock, such that when a stock is overbought or oversold, you're outside the scope of the bands and there's a chance to make a play. 

What happens, however, is during moments of strong consolidation, the bands for the stock get very tight, because there's almost no fluctuation in price. What this does is create [""squeeze"" signals](https://preview.redd.it/ltbrbfya16g71.png?width=2344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=334a56cd2c83b997c093f2a85ec5560abb169ef4), anticipating that there may be a strong breakout in the stock (in either direction) in the imminent future. What do CLOV BB's look like? I'm glad you asked. 

[Take a look at this chart with yet more terrible crayon drawings because I won't pay for a premium service to allow me extra charts and my current one I use is covered in even more crayon shit you don't want to see and I don't want to show you.](https://preview.redd.it/yrp4udya16g71.png?width=2216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e6ba45e72e93d52029298d805b35df401bb6db2)

Similar to how the MACD provides a strong indicator for bullish momentum in a stock, our Bollinger Bands are telling the same story in every piece of consolidation. **Every time our bands get tight, we move up**. What are we seeing right now? Our bands are getting tight after some pretty wild frequencies. 

#Evidence 3. RSI

Another fundamental trading tool, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) helps us measure rates of a stock being oversold or overbought in a perspective of momentum. This oscillating graph draws with crayons in a chart with values between 100 and 0, helping us see when stocks are being overbought (with a value of &gt;70) or oversold (&lt;30). The RSI is a kind of fascinating tool to watch because it *can* (not always) be predictive of human behavior, and can signal when long term or even momentary price changes are incoming. 

Well the RSI is important to us because it was not too many days ago that we hit [RSI values below 30, signaling to the world that we are very oversold.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/clover-health-investments-is-now-oversold-clov-2021-07-27) It doesn't take a brain to see it with the price, but the MACD similarly showed this heavily negative sentiment as it declined. 

The good news is that more often than not, once a stock starts breaking into oversold territory, it's likely due to rebound in the opposite direction in the near future. **In the case of CLOV, every approach (and breach) of oversold has reduced in a reversal and strong buying sentiment within a few months**. Exciting, bullish news. 

#Evidence 4. Price Stability and Short Scarcity
We've been trading sideways for what feels like an eternity. We have spent fourteen of the last 16 trading days moving sideways between the prices of $7.67 and $8.59. We had a momentary breakout for two days in the middle of this, before we were sent back down fast and hard. And even with the current price, the stock is doing remarkably well maintaining that $8 line for the most part. Although we have fallen below $8 11 times within the last 16 trading days, **we have only finished below $8 once**. 

At this time, Ortex is showing about a 90% utilization rate of the current shorts available, and a 22% SI. With utilization at that high of a level, overall, shorts are fairly thin, but not as thin as I'd like it to be. Yet, even with all of the weird price action and fuckery and short availability, investors are still maintaining this $8 support line very, very well. For the current utilization rate of shorts, and how well our price is doing, we have a strong backbone growing that appears to be giving us a lot of strength as we approach what looks to be a potential bullish run. I expect that the amount of shorts that do exist will probably be used to fight us on the way up, but the supply at this time seems to be generally limited. 

#Circumstantial Evidence: Social Sentiment
After our last runup, we got a lot of attention from people. Our membership since my time of joining months ago has moved from 6,000 to now 40,000 members. We are known and talked about as a short squeeze candidate by the media. We are known on Reddit. We have a big movement with our beloved YouTubes who are spreading awareness of the stock on Twitter, Stocktwits, YouTube, and elsewhere. **We are definitely not nobody at this moment.** There is, in my opinion, a powerful audience of people who could be eager at the chance to hear of some intense price movement in this volatile stock of ours, and we definitely have the reach to spread the word fast in the event of a bullish runaway. 

#Conclusion
Some of this might be some real amateur analysis to some of you, and if it is, that's okay. What I am seeing here are four powerful pieces of tangible evidence that are all pointing towards a potential bullish run in the incoming based on the following:

1. Every MACD crossover the stock has had up to this date has proved itself to be gainful. **We are just now in the crossover.**

2. Every MACD crossover has seen nice returns in a relatively short span of time, with gains as high as 368% (gamma squeeze) within about 20 days, to as low as 27% across two months. **Our stock is much more volatile and observed now than it was when we gained 27% in two months. If we see movement, I expect we will see movement *fast*.**

3. Every Bollinger Band's (BB's) contraction has lead to bullish momentum and outbreak in the time leading out of the contraction. **We entering a tightening contraction.**

4. Every BB's contraction has been coupled with a recent cross above the MACD Signal Line. **We are entering a BB's contraction with a recent cross above the MACD signal line.**

5. Our RSI is moving from oversold into the direction of overbought. **Buying momentum is on our side**. 

6. Every time the CLOV RSI has approached (or touched) the Oversold status, we have had buying momentum carry us into the bull run. **We are due to swing into heavy buying territory with the RSI at its current level.**

7. Our social media presence is big and people are interested. **If price movement gets volatile, there will very likely be crowds ready to get in. (Can anyone say, ""Opportunity for a gamma squeeze?""**

Take all of this together, and what do we get? A strong historical trend of a stock that has shown itself to run positive when technical indicators align, and they can do this in predictive, consistent patterns. The MACD is bullish. The RSI is bullish. The Bollinger's Bands are bullish. The price stability and support level is bullish. 

Every time these indicators align, the stock sees upwards movement within weeks to months. I don't know about you guys, but with the fuckery of 20 million FTD's, high SI%, high short utilization, and all of these bullish signals, in my non-financial advice opinion, **this seems like a stock that's ready to run and it's only a matter of time.** This screams mega-bullish to me. 

What happens with earnings upcoming here could be interesting. It could either catalyze or it could really hurt us depending on the aftermath. I'm inclined to think that if there's a negative reaction, it can only be *so* strong because many of current CLOV holders bought above current prices and selling doesn't make much of a difference. I really do not know who else would be selling the stock in a situation like this, because we do appear to be essentially bottoming out in terms of price. If there is a negative response to earnings, my hope is that holders will maintain the $8 support line. 

#TL;DR
In summary, a lot of positive technical indicators that have always shown growth for CLOV are aligning. I am expecting a price upswing in the coming weeks because of this, and further, because of our delicate social situation, I think there is a chance that there is a possibility for FOMO and/or a Gamma Squeeze because of the interest of onlookers. People *know* this stock wants to short squeeze, and those who want to play the odds may buy options on the way up. Statistically speaking, we are going to climb full dollar amounts, because every time these technical indicators align, we have (so far). Who knows how hard or fast this will go, but I am personally expecting that we will be breaking this $8-8.50 trading channel soon in the coming days/weeks, and there may be a metric shit ton of momentum that awaits to give us a kick once we do. Let's see how earnings goes first. **BULLISH AS FUCK.**

Alright retards, I am here to show you a strategy which works so well you might be able to stop giving blowies behind Wendies

I will make this as short as I can while still explaining how it works

&amp;#x200B;

First, how options are calculated (simplified):

There are 4 primary ways option values are calculated; Theta, Vega, Delta, and Gamma. I will ultra-simplify everything else besides Theta cause it's not super important for this play

Theta is the rate at which an option loses value over time if everything else is held constant. The closer to expiration the faster the Theta decay because it becomes riskier for the options buyer

Vega is the measurement of an options price in comparison to changes in IV (implied volatility).

Delta measures how much an option will change based on how much a stock price changes

Gamma measures delta’s change over time with respect to the underlying stock (super simplified)

&amp;#x200B;

How Calendar Spreads work: 

You sell a short dated call option and buy a longer dated call option (ex. 2 weeks out and 4 weeks out)

The call option closer to expiry loses value exponentially as it gets closer to expiration whereas the long dated call option loses way less value as it still has a few weeks left before expiration. This is due to Theta decay

https://preview.redd.it/n5zm3q7crxf71.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e73a9c55f883ff742834672f572b55718e4b18

Calendar Spreads take advantage of this by giving you a virtually risk free way of making insane returns (literally can’t go tits up). You can still play options and get insane returns without blowing up your portfolio and in turn blowing the Wendy's manager. 

Example of a play if you are bullish on MVST:

Buy: 9/17 12.5c for $1.27 ($127)

Sell: 8/20 17.5c for $0.30 ($30)

By doing this, you would have a maximum return of 426$ while only having a maximum risk of 97$. You also would have a %50.7 of profit, even though you can make over 4x on the upside than on the downside. 

These returns are only over an 11 day period, so imagine how much you can make if you do this year-round and with larger positions.

## Introduction

The BLS provides an employment picture of the US on the first Friday of every month. It estimates how many jobs were added or subtracted by sector. While some of the assumptions may be controversial (e.g. [the birth death model](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm)) and job numbers are prone to revisions, it remains the most widely anticipated statistic each month by the financial markets. Inflation is now coming in at a close second.

Considering its popularity, the job numbers are heavily analyzed by many sources. This article tries to use visuals and historical data to provide greater insight and perspective.

## Recent Trends

The latest jobs number showed an increase of 943k jobs, above expectations by 100k. Unfortunately, 240k gains came from government employment which are non-productive jobs and weigh on the economy. As shown below, 943k is above the recent trend, and the largest monthly gain since August 2020. Leisure and Hospitality continue to show the biggest gains, which is not surprising considering the massive layoffs they saw early in the pandemic and that unemployment benefits have recently been removed in some states. The unemployment rate ticked down from 5.9% to 5.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Change by sector](https://preview.redd.it/gisv68hwrxf71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9dd9c106d872a98e5f75eedd5d0ed8a27c0002f)

 

This next chart compares the current month with the trailing 12 month average. A few key takeaways:

* Government was well above average. 240k added vs -2k avg
* Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Health nearly doubled the TTM average
* Construction, Professional Business, and Trade/Transport/Utilities were all below TTM average

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Current vs TTM](https://preview.redd.it/0pwzlv9yrxf71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceff69e928d47aaf54932317d8919b6b9344cac7)

 

The table below gives a much more detailed breakdown of the numbers and the entire labor force. Some key takeaways:

* Government job increases were dominated by local governments (+230k) vs 18k in Federal and -8k at the State level
* Leisure and Hospitality have seen the biggest 12 month rebound, averaging 196k a month. This has accelerated in recent months to 364k likely a result of expiring unemployment benefits as stated above.
   * Even with these gains, it is still down 7.7% from where it was 3 years ago
* Mining and Logging is still down 14.6% but the recent recovery has doubled from 3.7k TTM vs 6k in the current period.
* Trade, Transportation, and Utilities is the largest sector (27k) but growth in jobs slowed in the recent period to 47k down from a TTM avg of 97k
* In aggregate the job market is still 1.5% smaller than it was 3 years ago

&amp;#x200B;

#### REVISIONS

As mentioned, this data is subject to revisions as new data becomes available. While the headline release gets a ton of market attention, the revisions get far less. The table below shows the impact of the revisions over different time periods. Please note this is as of the prior month since the most recent month has not seen any revisions. Important items to note:

* The recent three month period has been revised up by 48.7k a month
* The biggest upward revisions were seen in Leisure/Hospitality and Trade/Transportation
* Over the last year, revisions have been positive of nearly 40k a month or about 500k in aggregate

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure: 4 Revisions](https://preview.redd.it/rie4ehh0uxf71.png?width=2940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e6981330ce89c6b22a0cc669d6204db578df871)

 

## Historical Perspective

The chart below shows data going back to 1955. As the labor force has grown in total aggregate numbers, the recessions along the way have caused dips in the general trend. The Covid recession can be seen as the greatest job market loss since 1955. The chart also shows how much work the labor market still requires to regain the employment level seen prior to Covid.

The distribution of the workforce has changes significantly over the last 65+ years. Although the unemployment rate has been sharply falling over the last year (chart above), the labor force participation (61.7%) is still well below 18 months ago (63.2%) and much lower than the 66% pre financial crisis.

Introduction

The BLS provides an employment picture of the US on the first Friday of every month. It estimates how many jobs were added or subtracted by sector. While some of the assumptions may be controversial (e.g. [the birth death model](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm)) and job numbers are prone to revisions, it remains the most widely anticipated statistic each month by the financial markets. Inflation is now coming in at a close second.

Considering its popularity, the job numbers are heavily analyzed by many sources. This article tries to use visuals and historical data to provide greater insight and perspective.

Recent Trends

The latest jobs number showed an increase of 943k jobs, above expectations by 100k. Unfortunately, 240k gains came from government employment which are non-productive jobs and weigh on the economy. As shown below, 943k is above the recent trend, and the largest monthly gain since August 2020. Leisure and Hospitality continue to show the biggest gains, which is not surprising considering the massive layoffs they saw early in the pandemic and that unemployment benefits have recently been removed in some states. The unemployment rate ticked down from 5.9% to 5.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Change by sector](https://preview.redd.it/l0qgvuf7vxf71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddb73671f483c02e3694b8e4d2ceaacfc935b8f6)

 

This next chart compares the current month with the trailing 12 month average. A few key takeaways:

* Government was well above average. 240k added vs -2k avg
* Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Health nearly doubled the TTM average
* Construction, Professional Business, and Trade/Transport/Utilities were all below TTM average

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Current vs TTM](https://preview.redd.it/5qgkztc9vxf71.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e5460384532f457c80fbe3e7272ac776c494561)

 

The table below gives a much more detailed breakdown of the numbers and the entire labor force. Some key takeaways:

* Government job increases were dominated by local governments (+230k) vs 18k in Federal and -8k at the State level
* Leisure and Hospitality have seen the biggest 12 month rebound, averaging 196k a month. This has accelerated in recent months to 364k likely a result of expiring unemployment benefits as stated above.  

   * Even with these gains, it is still down 7.7% from where it was 3 years ago
* Mining and Logging is still down 14.6% but the recent recovery has doubled from 3.7k TTM vs 6k in the current period.
* Trade, Transportation, and Utilities is the largest sector (27k) but growth in jobs slowed in the recent period to 47k down from a TTM avg of 97k
* In aggregate the job market is still 1.5% smaller than it was 3 years ago

 REVISIONS

As mentioned, this data is subject to revisions as new data becomes available. While the headline release gets a ton of market attention, the revisions get far less. The table below shows the impact of the revisions over different time periods. Please note this is as of the prior month since the most recent month has not seen any revisions. Important items to note:

* The recent three month period has been revised up by 48.7k a month
* The biggest upward revisions were seen in Leisure/Hospitality and Trade/Transportation
* Over the last year, revisions have been positive of nearly 40k a month or about 500k in aggregate

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure: 4 Revisions ](https://preview.redd.it/666vu0zevxf71.png?width=2940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=337e43cc744c312e389ed75e8b2df3648591ad3e)

**Historical Perspective**

The chart below shows data going back to 1955. As the labor force has grown in total aggregate numbers, the recessions along the way have caused dips in the general trend. The Covid recession can be seen as the greatest job market loss since 1955. The chart also shows how much work the labor market still requires to regain the employment level seen prior to Covid.

Over the past year or two, online apparel and general Ecommerce sales have boomed. This is, quite obviously, due to the effects of COVID and it's multiple lockdowns. A large leader in this industry is Poshmark Inc: whose stock I would like to take a look at.

#THE #IMMENSE #SHORTING #OF #$POSH #AND #ITS #EFFECTS

I'm sure many of you already know how short squeezes and shorting already works, though if you do not I shall clarify; defined by Investopedia, a short squeeze is ""an unusual condition that triggers rapidly rising prices in a stock or other tradeable security. ... The short squeeze begins when the price jumps higher unexpectedly. The condition plays out as a significant measure of the short sellers coincidentally decide to cut losses and exit their positions.""

This has happened with many companies and very much could happen with $POSH. Stats show that 32.46% of the float is being shorted, majority by institutional investors.

Like we have seen with every other shorted stock, the price of the shares have plummeted because of immense shorting and market manipulation done by large institutions. In the matter of less than 8 months, the price of $POSH has fallen more than $48 (57.92%).

A short squeeze of this size would prove sizeable profits and would be lovely to cash into.

#THE #BOOMING #ECOMMERCE #MARKET #AND #HOW #IT #LINKS #WITH #COVID

As stated previously, Poshmark sells online clothing of which is a booming market and that has shown considerable growth over the years. Specifically looking at the past 2 years shows unbelievable highs, all because of COVID.

In fact, Digitalcommerce360.com states that ""Online apparel sales accounted for 46.0% of total U.S. apparel sales in 2020 and grew faster than in previous years. 46.0% of apparel sales in 2020 is up nearly 16 percentage points from a 30.1% penetration in 2019 and up from 26.6% in 2018"". They further this by adding that ""Ecommerce was growing fast before COVID-19 hit. But the pandemic pushed even more U.S. consumers online, contributing an additional $105 billion in U.S. online revenue in 2020 and accelerating ecommerce by two years"".

This steady and bullish growth of the Ecommerce market is mainly because of the COVID-19 lockdowns, though I believe it will continue to grow - short term and and long term.

#ADDRESSING #THE #SHORT #TERMS 

As I'm sure many of you know, a new COVID-19 variant by the name of Delta has popped up. This has caused wide spread worry and panic for good reason; the Delta variant is highly more infectious and the death rate from COVID-19 in the U.S. is rising steadily for the first time in months as cases are again increasing in what the CDC has referred to as “a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”.

Many - including myself and probably you - are wondering whether or not the USA will go back into another lockdown. To me, it seems very plausible. There are an extreme lack of vaccinated individuals who still continue to go out and party. There are lots of individuals who seem to think COVID no longer exist and/or the rules don't apply to them. There is far too much fake news and misinformation being spread through many social media sites and the news.

If we were to go back into a nation-wide lockdown, Ecommerce would once again BOOM.

#ADDRESSING #THE #LONG #TERM

As stated by digitalcommerce360.com already, the Ecommerce business was already rising - COVID only furthered this. I truly do believe this sector and the businesses inside it will continue on a steady boom over the coming years. This is because of the fact that many people have now been exposed to how much easier, smoother, and cheaper shopping online is. I know many people in my personal life who have since completely switched to online shopping, or made it their primary shopping source - including my own mother!

1) Possible and very plausible short squeeze imminent for $POSH

2) Ecommerce is a booming market which will most likely continue positively

3) COVID Delta variant will most likely support this stock

It identifies cannabis company stocks, ETFs, and SPACs you can buy and provides a wealth of valuation metrics on each. The cheapest and most expensive cannabis stocks are highlighted. Cannabis stocks are also compared to well-known companies in other sectors to ascertain relative value.

If you are either invested in cannabis stocks or thinking about investing, this book should be at the top of your reading list.

It is available in **Paperback** through Amazon at the following URL:

Reviewers have said: ""This book is a must read;"" ""I sure wish I had read this book before I invested in cannabis stocks;"" "" This book contains an unbelievable amount of essential information and fundamental research about the cannabis stocks.

Lithium is a main ingredient to today’s batteries. 

Lithium is an abundant resource.

The price per ton of lithium began decreasing in 2018

The number of producers of Lithium have decreased

Swelling demand for EV cars.

1 ton of lithium can be used for 90 cars

Think about paying someone money so they can amass the largest genetic database in the world, by far. 

Why is a database like this useful? Genetic data can be used to make the painfully inefficient drug discovery process faster. They've partnered with GSK: any profits (and costs) from the drugs that may be discovered from the partnership are split 50/50. 

When you genotype your spit you can have more control over your health. Healthcare is the states is dogshit and this is a service that people are increasingly interested in for improving their health. Think about it: if you learn from genetic testing that you're predisposed for a certain illness, you might take active steps to avoid that illness.

# Oshkosh $OSK protest dismissal, possibly Monday and why this is good for us

FYI: As some of you know Oshkosh is a large investor in Microvast and is currently being sued in claims court by Workhorse over the USPS NGDV. This is a contract to manufacture up to 165000 (EV:ice) mail trucks. It is our understanding that next week (possibly Monday) a ruling on a proposed protest dismissal will take place.

(Microvast will be providing batteries for EV.)

If protest is dismissed it will be Good for both Oshkosh and Microvast. I’m not a lawyer but the USPS/Oshkosh argument sounds solid. Workhorse broke rules, then sued saying rules were wrong.

“By filing this protest, Workhorse is telling the Court and the parties that the normal rules do not apply to Workhorse. This is wrong. Workhorse, like any other company that wants to do business with the USPS, is required to complete the USPS’s mandatory disagreement process before going to Court. Workhorse failed to do so here, and the Court should, therefore, dismiss” ∿Oshkosh lawyer

# Upcoming earnings date for Microvast

This information hasn't been shared officially by the company BUT they have to report before 8/16. So we can expect to see the earnings upcoming week

# Shorts are bleeding red since yesterday

On iBorrowDesk, if you look at the old ticker, you will see that there was 2M shares available to short on 7/26 (HOD was $10), then on 7/27, that number dropped to 550K, and then that number steadily declines to 0 by 8/4). Between the time that 2M short position was staked out and the time the amount available went to 0 (7/26 to 8/4), the price range traded between $10 - $8. This means that 2M short positions are in the red as of yesterday. They are obviously waiting for the momentum to wind down to cover their position, but if we keep this up, we will force their hand to cover at a loss.

Obviously this isn’t a short squeeze only. But if we get this thing to $20 these guys gotta buy 2M shares back to cover. That would go BRRRR

Over the past year or two, online apparel and general Ecommerce sales have boomed. This is, quite obviously, due to the effects of COVID and it's multiple lockdowns. A large leader in this industry is Poshmark Inc: whose stock I would like to take a look at.

#THE IMMENSE SHORTING OF $POSH AND ITS EFFECTS

I'm sure many of you already know how short squeezes and shorting already works, though, in case you do not, I shall clarify; defined by Investopedia, a short squeeze is ""an unusual condition that triggers rapidly rising prices in a stock or other tradeable security. ... The short squeeze begins when the price jumps higher unexpectedly. The condition plays out as a significant measure of the short sellers coincidentally decide to cut losses and exit their positions.""

This has happened with many other companies and very much could happen with $POSH. Stats show that 32.46% of the float is being shorted, majority by institutional investors.

Like we have seen with lots of other stocks on this subreddit, the price of the shares have plummeted because of immense shorting and market manipulation done by large institutions. In the matter of less than 8 months, the price of $POSH has fallen more than $48 (57.92%).

A short squeeze of this size would prove sizeable profits and would be lovely to cash into.

#THE BOOMING ECOMMERCE MARKET AND HOW IT LINKS WITH COVID

As stated previously, Poshmark sells online clothing of which is a booming market and that has shown considerable growth over the years. Specifically looking at the past 2 years shows unbelievable highs, all because of COVID.

In fact, digitalcommerce360.com states that online apparel sales ""accounted for 46.0% of total U.S. apparel sales in 2020 and grew faster than in previous years. 46.0% of apparel sales in 2020 is up nearly 16 percentage points from a 30.1% penetration in 2019 and up from 26.6% in 2018"". They further this by adding that the Ecommerce market ""was growing fast before COVID-19 hit. But the pandemic pushed even more U.S. consumers online, contributing an additional $105 billion in U.S. online revenue in 2020 and accelerating ecommerce by two years"".

This steady and bullish growth of Ecommerce is mainly because of the COVID-19 lockdowns, though I believe it will continue to grow - short term and and long term.

#THE SHORT TERM

As I'm sure many of you know, a new COVID-19 variant by the name of Delta has popped up. This has caused wide spread worry and panic for good reason; the Delta variant is highly more infectious and the death rate from COVID-19 in the U.S. is rising steadily for the first time in months as cases are again increasing in what the CDC has referred to as “a pandemic of the unvaccinated"".

Many - including myself and probably you - are wondering whether or not the USA will go back into another lockdown. To me, it seems very plausible. There are an extreme lack of vaccinated individuals who still continue to go out and party. There are lots of individuals who seem to think COVID no longer exists and/or the rules don't apply to them. There is far too much fake news and misinformation being spread through many social media sites and the news.

If we were to go back into a nation-wide lockdown, Ecommerce would once again BOOM.

#ADDRESSING THE LONG TERM

As stated by digitalcommerce360.com already, the Ecommerce sector was already rising - COVID only furthered this. I truly do believe this sector and the businesses inside it will continue on a steady rise over the coming years. This is because of the fact that many people have now been exposed to how much easier, smoother, and cheaper shopping online is. I know many people in my personal life who have since completely switched to online shopping, or made it their primary shopping source - including my own mother!

#SUMMARY

1) Possible and very plausible short squeeze imminent for $POSH

2) Ecommerce is a booming market which will definitely continue positively

3) COVID Delta variant will most likely support this stock

4) Fuck institutional short sellers who manipulate markets",wallstreetbets,$POSH DD AND ITS IMMENSE SHORT SELLING,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ozwho0/posh_dd_and_its_immense_short_selling/

I very rarely see them mentioned at all, but this is great stable stock for long-term holding

WHO is Skywest?:

St. George, Utah-based Skywest Airlines (or as we in the airline business call them ""The Mormon Air Force"") stock has taken a beating in the last few weeks, along with the rest of the sector,  going down almost 40% at one point. And yet, this likely the best managed, most profitable, best cash liquidity  and debt position airline out there today.

For those that don't know, Skywest is the biggest Airline you have never heard of, the largest Regional Airline in the world, and provides flight services (Aircraft, crew, and maintenance) to United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines. Skywest either owns, leases, or flies aircraft owned by the majors and assigned to them.

The vast majority of Skywest Revenue comes from ""Fee-per-Departure"", meaning the Mother Carrier assigned them a time and a route to fly. If they are ready to go at flight time, they get paid. There are bonuses for on-time performance, customer satisfaction surveys, etc. The Mother carrier pays for fuel, as well. Regardless of how many people are on the plane, Skywest gets paid a set amount to operate the flight, with minimum revenue assurances for the duration of a contract.

Skywest does fly a small number of flights ""at-Risk"", meaning at their own cost, under United, Delta,  and American Airlines. With only a couple of exceptions, these are subsidized, either through the Fed's Essential Air Service Programs to small towns across America, or grants paid by localities to Skywest for Service.

They moved a few years to deal with the coming pilot shortage problem, starting Pilot Cadet Programs with several major universities as a path to Skywest Employment, and investing into their own initial flight training program in Salt Lake.

&amp;#x200B;

Financials:

Skywest Q2 2021 earnings completely blew out the analysts estimates of making $0.28 per share by almost a Dollar per, reporting EPS of $1.22.

SkyWest received a total of $250 million from the U.S. Treasury under the payroll support program extension agreement (PSP3). In the same period, the carrier repaid a $60-million secured loan under the CARES Act. 

Zack's list SKYW as a Strong Buy to $65-$70

Raymond James ha its price objective from $66.00 to $67.00.

Do what you will, but I have made a few Calls that I think are going to pay off handsomely. I really do like this stock, even more as a long-term hold. Even if things shut down again, Skywest is in a great position to weather it, because of it's cash and assets positions.

I can't wrap my head around the fact that $UPST is not more talked about @ WSB

This thing has huge short squeeze potential (earnings on tuesday aftermarket).

Float for Upstart holdings roughly:

\- 77M shares

\- 38M institutionally owned

\- 15M Insiders (won't sell)

\- so only 14M shares are floating --&gt; OF WHICH 10M ARE SHORTED.

Which means, the effective short interest is even higher.

Motley Fool recommended them AGAIN this week.

It has gone gap up and ATH everytime after earnings so far.

If it follows through you should be making 50% on your money in 2 weeks post earnings. If UPST is gonna move, it's gonna really fkin move.

This is coming from a guy whose parents were dumbass spenders when they had money and then had nothing after 2008. I witnessed it first there. Money, the great illusion. This is my story…

I grew up in a dysfunctional family like most of us. I was born in Chester South Carolina and lived in myrtle beach from 7-18. My dad was a car salesman who owned a used car lot from 2002 til 2010 when he lost it dude to poor decisions and blaming Obama for everything. My moms been a second grade teacher for 35 years. My dad made lots of money for a time. He never saved. New motorcycle, new boat new cars, new this new that. He was never good at showing love so buying shit was his way. So you could say I was a little bit spoiled as a kid. Then high school came and all that money he made went into drugs. He’s pay 1$ a mg for OxyContin and always kept a full bottle. I remember stealing them and selling them so I knew what was up. He was a fucking train wreck. He let the money and the careless lifestyle get a hold of him and it stole away my dad. Before my parents could blink I left after high school graduation and joined the army and began my own life journey. I was too careless with money. Every check I got was blown at the club or on new clothes. I was good to go until I turned 20 and got kicked out for failing a drug test. I tested hot for cocaine. A drug that leaves your system in a couple days…. I was a habitual cocaine user for 3 months leading up to my discharge. I barely kept a dollar in my name man it was a rough rough time after that. I worked as a professional mover and a server while I worked through school. Had my mom not pushed me that wouldn’t have happened either. During this time I found bitstuff. Long story short a buddy of mine was mining with a 3.5m/h rig that looked like a server rack and making 15 litecoin a day… I WITNESSED THE GENESIS OF DOG coin DUDE. Needless to say my thirst for quick wealth began but I was broke!!! I went so far as to sell my car to buy litecoin and I remember I sold my car for 1000 bucks and bought about 100 litecoin in 2015 only to sel it to pay my light bill a month later… the struggle was real.

Eventually, I met my eventual wife at 21 and my life instantly changed. I finally found a source of stability in my life and was able to focus  on achieving goals. I was always into working out and since my degree was exercise science I naturally fell into personal training. I created my own business in 2014 and spent the first 3 years grinding my dick off building this thing. In February 2018 I had my first 10k month and never looked back. For 2 full years I made between 10k and 15k a month and by Jan 2021 I had saved exactly 100k up. Now the fun begins….
(I got in on the bull run of dec 2017 and got crushed on vechain and sold for like a 90% loss on 5k only to watch it go way above my original price recently and was forever scorned. I completely watched from the sideline on this last bull run and instead bought a mining rig)…

I got into stocks in 2019 when I bought my first shares of apple. I then really got into it in 2020 during the crash. I got really really into it when I discovered options… by sept 2020 I had 30k insvested. By January 2021 my portfolio has rocketed but I was still at 30k because I was in so deep on a 300$ baba call. I then found $BLSP on January 16th for half a penny and watched it go up %450 in one day. I liquidated my portfolio and went all in on penny stocks. I was gooood at it man I was in and out for huge gains for 4 weeks straight and took my folio from 30k to 210k…. And then just as quick and as easy it came so too it went… I managed to lose 70k over the next month. The last loss was 24k on gme puts. I almost got a divorce from that one real talk. Then we bought a house and moved to a new city. I shut the doors on my business and got a new sales job while my wife works as a nurse. I took some time away from trading but the bug never leaves you. In July I got back in the game... i started with hood old pump n dumps like RSLS and DLPN and made like 7k in a week doing that. But I got bored with that and I started trading big on the daily spy options. I got lucky as fuck on the recent dip to 422 and bought puts and rode them all the way up to 75k in profits off two days trading.... I was up to 90k profits in less than 2 weeks. Now Having been through this situation before you'd think is learned to quit while I'm up right? No, I thought I had way more to go, I was already calling myself a millionaire because I thought I'd figured out a system that worked... emptiness and greed were all I felt. Naturally life has a way of making you humble. Some sooner than later. I lost 50k in one day, then 20k, then 15k, then another 15k. Took my bank roll from 140k to 40k in one week... luckily I have now closed that account, and I'm stepping away to get my head right. 

In summary…
I have made 200k in 2 weeks and lost half that in a month. Then I made 100k in a week and lost all of it the next week In four trades. Both times I made all that money, all that I felt was greed. There was nothing satisfactory at all with it. Buying shit gets empty. Im not a lavish guy either so I live very practical. I was empty inside with 6 figures in the bank. All that money can fuck you up mentally and make you feel like you don’t need to work anymore and it just kills your drive. It fuels greed and the desire to keep the game going. Now I’m Chillin with 40k in the bank and to be honest I’m cool with that over the stress trading has caused. My wife is a nurse and I bring home about 5-10k a month depending on my sales job. And I also have a 600m/h miner that makes me roughly 40$ a day. Idk my point is just set yourself up with a reasonable stable life and don’t get caught up in all the hype that money brings. It’s fucking poison. Get a decent job. Wake up and have a purpose. Get a purpose if you don’t. Chasing money is not the answer. Take it from me: MONEY DOES NOt BUY HAPPINESS. What it can do is provide stability in your life and all you need is a good job to accomplish that. Day trading as a pro requires a lot of variables to fall in your favor and trying to make your self into something your not is a hard truth we all must face.

I'm primarily looking at shares (I've been fucked too many times with options...), but might also buy some longer DTE options as well as FDs.

# Part 0: Short Squeeze

This isn't the main reason I'm buying, but the short interest on $FSLY is definitely worth noting and is high enough to trigger a squeeze.  We're looking at about 20% short interest [\[1\]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/fsly).  

# Part 1: Company Profile and Market Overview

Fastly is a cloud computing company.  One of their main services is a CDN, which is basically how you're able to load up anime titties 10 minutes before you go to sleep.  Additionally, they have some cybersecurity operations as well, coming from a subsidiary they acquired in August 2020 for about $700M (cash + stock).

Before getting into their numbers, I'd like to talk about their most recent earnings shitshow.  At time of writing, the stock is down almost 20% after some bad forward guidance.  For the full year of 2020 Fastly called for an adjusted loss of -$0.65 to -$0.57 EPS and revenue of $340 to 350m. This is against an original analyst expectation of -$0.43 on $382m in revenue.  The main reason for this is that FSLY had an outage that lasted for about an hour and affected companies like Reddit, NYT, and Twitch, among others.  Keep in mind that Fastly reported this issue on June 8, yet from the week June 7 to June 14, the stock rally about 13%.  Rather bizarre, as you'd think this would have tanked the stock then.  What I take from this is that initially the market underestimated the impact of the outage and is now overestimating it.  Overall, the outage is a valid cause for concern, and you should take into account whether or not you trust FSLY to fix its shit going forward.

Now lets get down to the fundamentals.  FSLY has show solid revenue growth, of \~40% since 2017.  Even though that should drop to 20% this year, that still represents solid growth.  Additionally, if you think that the outage was a one-off event, then presumably we can expect to go back to that juicy 40% annual revenue growth.  It's also worth drawing attention to FSLY's total asset growth which has gone up 10x from 2017 to 2020.

With respect to Cloud Computing, I'm sure most of us know that this is an industry that's going to generate a lot of wealth.  The industry has a CAGR of \~18% over the next several years.  Additionally, the market is already estimated anywhere from $200-300b (as of this year).  Most big tech companies have spent huge amounts of money on their cloud computing efforts (see Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.).

# Part 2: Analysts are (were?) bullish

The average price target of FSLY is around $52, representing \~50% upside from the current price of $35 [\[2\]](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FSLY/research-ratings).  Now, it should be noted that price targets may not have baked in the bad guidance and outage, but it should also be noted that historically FSLY has traded well above $50.

Honestly, I don't really pay to much attention too much attention to analysts, but it's nice confirmation bias.

This could be a signal that something the market is about to change. It has been trending upwards for some time now, so the only other two options are: sideways or trending down.

Betting against an upward trend feels foolish, but does this signal mean something?

### A security analytics software firm with an already well established customer base will continue to grow based on increasing demand for their service and a transition to a SaaS model.

## Company Overview

**Market cap at publishing: $1.77B**

**Price at publishing: $26.86**

Cognyte Software is a global leader in security analytics software. They provide services to governments and enterprises worldwide. The company's open software is used to successfully identify, neutralize, and prevent national security, personal safety, business continuity, and cyber threats. They have over a thousand governmental and private clients. Cognyte Software was incorporated in 2020 as a spinoff of one of Verint’s business units and is headquartered in Herzliya, Israel.

## Financials

The company was just spun off in March 2021 so there won’t be any in-depth analysis on their financials or growth. I prefer not to compare the current stand-alone company with the past when they were still part of Verint as I believe they will do much better now as a separate entity and it won’t be fair. Most of the in-depth analysis will be done on the stock price and how it compares to the rest of the industry. However, here are some financial highlights from their latest filing:

[Cognyte growth taken from their presentation](https://preview.redd.it/aaj7hq5mijf71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88ab04330da3a577a7a2df57440e5b2b99b32fd6)

* Solid growth in the double digits across many metrics
* Profitable with earnings of $14.2M for 2020
* Solid balance sheet includes $54M in cash and $285M in equity
* Positive annualized free cash flow of $103M for 2020

## The Stock, I Like It

CGNT which is currently trading at $26.86 has a market cap of $1.7B. The stock is down 3% since its inception and is still 24% off its 52 week high of $33.37. I am comparing them with two other analytical software firms, Palantir and Fireye. Palantir is more of a general software firm that processes data across many industries while Fireye focuses on security like Cognyte.

[Comparing Cognyte stock to Palantir and FireEye](https://preview.redd.it/wdyvs84rijf71.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d67f12b9194d3c38a33db37d20efb4b3fa3b297)

You’re not seeing things, Cognyte Software is highly undervalued compared to its peers. Yes, it appears Palantir is overvalued but maybe it’s not, after all, Palantir’s price has been steady for almost a year now. My point is that if Palantir is fairly valued or even close to it then the price of Cognyte Software should be **$137.93**!. That would be nice but let’s not get ahead of ourselves, it’s more likely that Palantir is overvalued than fairly valued. However, even compared against its closely related peer FireEye, Cognyte still looks cheap. Even more so when you consider that Cognyte is actually profitable and neither FireEye nor Palantir are and FireEye has a higher D/E ratio.

## Outlook

I think Cognyte Software is in a fantastic position to grow based on several factors including:

* They have a large customer base of over 1000 clients, 87% of which are governments who always pay their bills on time and like to stick to something when it works
* Over two decades of experience providing a complicated service with a high barrier to entry
* The ever-growing complexity of cyberattacks will demand more complex solutions like those provided by Cognyte
* Their transition to a SaaS business model is going well as recurring revenue is already up 17% YoY
* They are Israeli and those guys are smart with computers and stuff
* Their commitment to tackling the challenge of successfully investigating ""internet money"" transactions

C’mon, did you think I wasn’t going to throw in a picture of an internet money coin and not say the big “c” word? This company is a buy based on this image alone. /s

## Valuation

I use Damodaran’s DCF analysis using free cash flow to firm to come up with a valuation. Here are the assumptions I made about future cash flows and all other inputs. Sorry, I know it’s not the prettiest but there is a method to my madness. The present value I get from my analysis is $2.9B or $44.87/share which, compared to the current price would represent a discount of 70%.

## Price Target

I have a price target of **$44.87** on Cognyte Software. 

**TL;DR:** Good company making smart decisions in a great industry that will undoubtedly continue to grow over the years.

# Bergio International Plans to Expand Overseas Jewelry Manufacturing

  

***Berge meets with top economic leaders in Eastern Europe to solidify manufacturing relationships &amp; facilitate factory purchase to accommodate recent acquisitions demands***

**FAIRFIELD, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / August 5, 2021 /** Bergio International Inc. [(OTC PINK:BRGO)](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/brgo/overview), a premier jewelry designer and manufacturer, moved forward with steps to expand international jewelry manufacturing in Eastern Europe to accommodate growing customer and market demand after recent landmark acquisitions of [Aphrodite's](https://pr.report/5AMaPjC2) and [GearBubble](https://pr.report/IZx806Q-).

CEO Berge Abajian went on a tour of Eastern Europe, including Istanbul, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia, to meet with global economic leaders, including Vladimir Karapetyan, Ambassador to Ukraine, and Vahan Kerobyan Minister of Economy, both from the Republic of Armenia. He also met with the Head of Customs to discuss import and export assistance to facilitate transportation in and out of the Republic of Armenia.

Bergio is currently negotiating the 50% purchase of a factory located in the Republic of Armenia. The company is awaiting documents to review inventory, assets, and conduct all financial due diligence on the anticipated acquisition.

I took the liberty of checking valuation cap to revenue ratios and noticed the following:

WISH - Revenue $3.2Bn - Cap to Rev: 2.5

ETSY - Revenue $21Bn - Cap to Rev: 8.9

and guess what with all the pumping from certain subscription based e-magazines and websites, Shopify is at:

Revenue - 3.8Bn and Cap to Rev: 49.2 :/

Even Amazon doesnt have that level of Cap to Rev like Shopify has and the Wish Revenues are marginally lower than Shop's yet the Wish is largely undervalued (in terms of Cap to Rev ratios) by almost 3.5 times against ETSY, 5 times against Amazon and a whopping 24 times against SHOPIFY.

To be fair, fundamentally, WISH is cash rich, has been experiencing growing revenues and have started to cut costs. With them hiring former Google and Amazon executives, I do think they are going in a great place into the developing their own logistics and warehousing and potentially entering the cloud computing industry.

If you think my analysis of the above is wrong, please feel free to rectify me.

Listen here retards, I have a play which will make your wife’s boyfriend so hard he will finally take a turn with you

McAfee announced a special dividend of $4.50 per share which is INSANE considering the stock is only $30

As we get closer to August 13th, the stock will go up as people buy shares to get that dividend. Options are cheap and this has not even been priced in since the stock has only gone up 81 cents since the announcement!

McAfee's stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of 450,000 shares. A higher trading day of 900,000 shares made this thing go up almost 7%! If people start buying heavy for the dividend, this thing will go to the MOOON

This play doesn’t require McAfee to have solid fundamentals or any other boomer r/investing words, it just takes advantage of people being greedy and buying in to get the dividend.

My strategy is to buy a mix of $25, $30, and $35 call options and sell these before August 13th because people will sell their shares after they are eligible for the $4.5 dividend.

My positions:

8 25c, 10 30c, 3 35c, 3 25p (all expiring 8/20)

""Robinhood’s recent IPO was initially lackluster, with the stock trading down ~7% from its IPO price. In recent days the stock then started to catch a bid as Cathie Wood &amp; ARK bought in. However yesterday HOOD stock launched over 50%…but why? Options.""

Chart 1: https://imgur.com/gallery/V4Tm3K5

""Yesterday was the first day that options trading was available in HOOD, with strikes prices available up to $70.""

""Below we’ve plotted out the options activity as a function of delta. By viewing the delta of the options trading, we can estimate the amount of hedging exposure these trades generated. If the options generated large positive deltas that is telling us two things:""

""1)It indicates the trades were strongly bullish (buying calls and/or selling puts)""

""2)It infers that options market makers needed to purchase stock in order to hedge their exposure""

""As you can see below, right after the market opened there was a surge in positive delta activity (green line) which is likely call buying. In effect there was a gamma squeeze right at the open. This in turn pushed the stock price to an initial high near $80 (red arrow). Shortly after the stock reverted strongly as options flows turned bearish – traders bought puts and sold calls (blue arrow).""

""Notice that after the blue arrow the options delta stays flat. This suggests that options trading was directionally neutral, and remained that way up until ~2PM EST. At that point the options flow turned quite bullish (green arrow), which coincided with the stock pinning the $70 strike.""

Chart 2: https://imgur.com/gallery/a5YjNqO

""As noted above, $70 was the highest available strike for options yesterday. Our EquityHub data shows that is exactly where most traders now hold the bulk of call positions, and the strike which SpotGamma considers the key options strike for today. Given this, we think its no coincidence that the stock closed right at $70 last night.""

Chart 3: https://imgur.com/gallery/v8ICgue

""Today the exchanges have now listed options strikes up to $170, which gives traders a whole new set of calls to purchase. This may setup a further gamma squeeze in HOOD as traders push into these higher strike calls. We think retail traders in particular are attracted to these higher strikes as they generally cost less (from a premium perspective) making them more accessible to traders with smaller assets.""

""For a gamma squeeze to continue we want to see the stock trade over $70, with todays call volumes in the order of several hundred thousand. That volume needs to show particularly at strikes in the $75-100 range. This should keep the pressure on dealers to buy the stock which could keep the gamma squeeze in motion. If the stock cannot hold $70, then dealers may be able to start an unwind of their long stock hedges, which could pressure the stock back lower.""

""The other factor here is time. The bulk of the current options position does not expire until 8/20, which means that the decay of those call positions is a bit slower than we may see in typical gamma squeezes. Most often traders pile into the weekly expirations, with only ~5 days to expiration. We’ve documented this phenomenon here. The fact that there is more time to expiration on these RobinHood calls could work to the benefit of bullish traders.""",wallstreetbets,SpotGamma - Robinhood (HOOD) Gamma Squeeze,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyhyuj/spotgamma_robinhood_hood_gamma_squeeze/

So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features.

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

This information is a good tool or strategy to use whether you’re investing in a stock as a long, a short, gambling/betting or if you’re just trying to get into a position you like.

This does not apply to options but I mean I guess you could for sure.

The idea is to not put all your eggs in one basket. Let’s say I like a stock and I believe it’s going to move in a positive direction. Let’s say we dedicated $2,000 to drop into this position.

The best strategy is to not dump your whole $2,000 in this example into that position.

Just like daytraders when they have their selected stocks they’ve chosen based on TA they won’t dump all of their money that they allocated to trade that stock right away. They’ll apply a fixed portion, (let’s say out of $400 they’ve allocated for that trade, they’ll start with $200 and look for support among other things of course before they dump more money throughout the day). This allows them the ability to adjust their strategy and sometimes get in at better positions and so forth.

When investing/gambling this concept should be applied. Ex: I buy XYZ stock at $10. I have $2k I decide to invest in this stock. Instead of dropping the full $2k into the stock at $10, you can then drop $1k, and keep the remaining $1k allocated to that stock to strategize with. Ex: if the stock now for some reason drops significantly, you’ve just reduced your potential losses ($1k instead of the full $2k) and now you have funds that you’ve allocated specifically for that stock to average down with.

This can be applied to intraday trading, swing trading, or when holding a long position etc.

This is a good strategy whether you’re placing a bet, day or swing trading, or going long into a position.

I see a lot of losses on here that are not FD’s or bets and people buying at the very top. I figured I’d post this to remind people that what I mentioned above is a very viable strategy to incorporate into your trading style.
