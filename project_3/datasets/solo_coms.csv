Well she couldn't figure out where the hostel was and wandered around for *hours*, trying to get directions with no Spanish at all and somehow no concept of where the hostel was. The bunch of us that had become friends there had probably been staying there a week already.

Turns out she was no more than a block or two away the whole time.

clarkiecw,t2_w7i98ee,"I'm not the person you asked the question to, but I've been to Italy in both Spring and Autumn before - and I personally preferred Autumn.

In Spring, I found the heat a bit much (I'm very pale and from England though so don't let that stop you), but the number of crowds was quite large, and there were lots of families with children so overall it was quite loud. However the sunlight made everything look absolutely gorgeous outdoors, in places like the Forum and the Coliseum in Rome, and it was like a summer holiday come early!

In Autumn, the weather was just perfect for me - no rain, nice breeze, no stifling heat or sunburn but no scarves or hats etc, there were generally less crowds, mostly adults and couples so the mood in the museums was a bit quieter and more reflective, and it was really cosy to eat dinner in a restaurant al fresco with a blanket. Florence for example still looked absolutely stunning, I don't think any weather could change that though haha. I've never been to the Amalfi Coast before though, and I'd probably choose to do that in Spring instead however.

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"Italy is a great place for art and culture, with some excellent museums in particular, though there are many “must sees” among church and cathedral frescoes and statuary also. There are several amazingly fine examples in Milan, Venice, Florence, and Rome. Verona has a surprisingly good art museum and some decent church frescoes also. Haven’t been to Naples, but my understanding is that there are some worthy examples there as well. And as you’re probably aware, there’s no substitute for seeing the work in person, plus when it comes to frescoes and statuary, you have no choice — they don’t get loaned out to other museums.

I would also say don’t worry about the touristy aspects of places like Rome and Venice, or Florence for that matter. The secret has been out for these fine cities for years, and there’s a reason they’re crowded. Go anyway — the art is so worth it. If you do some research and want tweaking on suggestions, let me know.

Of course, the musts aren’t confined to Italy. Every major city in Europe has at least one fine art museum, and world class examples such as The Louvre (Paris), The Prado (Madrid), and the National Gallery (London) should be on any art lover’s bucket list. But Italy is a great place to start.",1632305557,hdtsk6p,t3_psi04v,/r/solotravel/comments/psi04v/first_time_traveling_outside_of_the_us_and_i_want/hdtsk6p/,1,solotravel

properfckr,t2_dgcvejtx,"Great question!

Yes for sure, some photos are little more than ""show the folks at home"", which can be pretty much deleted immediately after sharing. 

My son used to ask me to send a photo of my view from my hotel window, which was fun. 

I consider myself an accomplished amateur photographer, and after travelling for over 12 years of my life, I only take photos which I know are going to be good photos. 

So I might be on the top of a mountain after a long hike, and there is a fabulous panoramic view, but it is midday, the sun is high, the air hazy, there are no shadows and no contrast, and if you take a moment and switch your vision to photography vision, you can see that although beautiful, it would be a crap photo. 

Of course everyone on top of the mountain is snapping away - usually with their backs to the sun, so their faces are in shadow, making the backdrop way too bright, and their faces way too dark. 

No matter! They snap away anyhow. They take hazy photos of lots of water and air, but nothing to look at - no subject. 

And if you don't take a photo, you feel like there is something wrong with you, as if you are missing something that they are not, when in fact, it is the other way around. 

Just as having a tomato plant on your balcony does not make you a farmer, having a camera in your hand does not make you a photographer. 

Yes, I have taken many, many, many! such crap shots, and this is back in the day when you had to pay for each and every hazy, no-subject, washed-out bay with water and sky print before you even knew they were crap shots!

One our one-year around-the-world trip with my (ex)wife and kids, after every day out and about exploring and taking photos, we'd play our favourite family game: keep or delete. 

We'd go through every photo from the day, and collectively shout out ""Keep!"" or ""Delete!""

We would agree on the vast majority of the shots, which were clear deletes. 

Eventually you skip taking the bad shot, rather than spend the time later deleting it. 

Some places are very photogenic, and some are not. I will find myself wondering why it is I have not taken any shots in some places, and in others I will purposely go on early morning or late afternoon photo-taking walks to get great lighting. 

Cartagena, Colombia was incredibly photogenic to me, whereas in Panama City I didn't take a single photo.

Do I look at any of these photos later? 

The photos I still look at, and still like, are the ones I consider ""great"". I like them because they are great shots, not because of the memory, or even the place. 

As you know, it takes a thousand shots to get one good one, if you are lucky. And a thousand, thousand shots to get one great one, if you are lucky. 

I'm always on the hunt for the great ones.",1632306550,hdttqbb,t3_pshsos,/r/solotravel/comments/pshsos/why_do_you_take_photos_when_you_travel/hdttqbb/,1,solotravel

Adventurous-Yam-7908,t2_8iwwrp9r,"Well my biggest screw up was probably the time I tried to act like a back-packer in SE Asia... turns out that to do that you either need to have very low standards or a lot of money, neither of which described me at the time (student but with a champagne taste on a beer budget)  


Decided to not book things ahead with the exception of a full moon party in Koh Panang. First leg went well so my confidence was high, quickly started to realize my mistake once I arrived in the north of Thailand - very odd accommodations in a weird area of China Town where no tourists seemed to come - but that was quickly resolved next day at an additional cost of course.  


Problem came when it was time to head down to that Full Moon Party booking that I had already payed for. Turns out it was Thailands national holiday and literally all trains were fully booked, flights were crazy expensive especially as I needed two flights. Add to this that I had left my suitcase at the train station back in Bangkok... Finally a decision is made to fly down to Bangkok, taxi to train station to get suitcase, then mad dash to find a tourist ""vip"" buss down south to connect with a boat to get to the island. All in all supposed to take 30h.   


My travel companion manages to eat something and get a lovely session of Bangkok belly... while on the bus from hell. Driver spoke zero english, the promised bathroom onboard was locked with a padlock oh and then there were lots of random stops throughout the night in the middle of nowhere with zero explanation. This followed by us all getting forced to get off the bus at dawn in a random location where again no one spoke english and all we could grasp is that a new transport would come. Several hours later a weird mini bus arrived where we were crammed in like sardines hoping we wouldn't die and that we were actually heading in the right direction. Finally we arrived to the boat docks, only to find out we were booked on the slowest boat possible (supposed to be a 1.30-2h ride and took close to 5) and when we finally got there no taxis were available. After finally paying a local to get us to the right spot we discover a building site... turns out the hotel was still being built but oh right we have some bungalows that are finished.

JSavageOne,t2_62e63gov,"To start, it seems like your paranoia about COVID is making it difficult for you to enjoy yourself. The virus is not even as remotely as dangerous for young people as the media makes it out to be (eg. most of my friends got it, none of them had any lingering symptoms). Unless you've got pre-existing conditions that put you at risk, just chill out and enjoy life (especially if you're already vaccinated). We're all going to die at some point anyways.

Second, you seem very insecure and uncomfortable in your own skin. Being afraid of eating alone...really? Nobody gives a sh\*t. If anything it's cool - your life right now as a solo traveler in a foreign country is probably more interesting than that of some average person in their home country (not that it's a competition).

If you want to meet people, you'll need to get out of your comfort zone and talk to people. Obviously this is easiest at hostels. You could also go to meetups or couchsurfing events. Or you can just approach people anywhere.

I don't mean to minimize your problems - I used to be very shy myself and lacking in confidence.

What I did in Meteora was rent an eBike in Kalambaka. It's a very easy and fun alternative way to see the monasteries.

BerriesAndMe,t2_14irxttl,"So for making money: think about what you're studying and if there's a way you can use that to make some extra cash (eg if you're studying web design you could offer to set up cheap websites).. if you're into finance look into investing, etc. I think this is your main goal: figure out how to make money up front.

For figuring out how much you money you need: Look on google, lots of people do their break down after a world trip and break it down by country or region.

I spent 10months in SA and CA. I did daily expenses on a budget (accommodation, food, travel, little partying) and splurged BIG on experiences (over &gt;1500$ in dives, 600$ for a mountain biking trips, skyjumping, plenty of guided tours etc). I spent about $25.000 in total in 2017 (but I also worked a couple years leading up to it and was older than you are now) and could do everything whenever I wanted everywhere. If you can save up this much, you'll be traveling in style.

I'm seeing guides online that say you should expect about $10.000/year which seems realistic to me. If you need to bring the budget much lower, you'll probably need to be a bit thrifty.. but I would assume you could probably do it for 5000-7000$ as well. Much lower and I'd be worried about getting stuck and not being able to go back. Keep in mind that the cheaper you travel, the slower you move and the more time you need.

If you need to drop costs: Consider camping over hostels, in the south it's very common. Cook in the hostel/on your camp stove.Also look into volunteering. Essentially you'll get accommodation and 1-2meals a day for free while helping out on the farm/in the hostel, etc. Be aware that some of these agreements are skirting the lines of legality in terms of 'working on a tourist visa' and usually expect 1-2 week commitments at a minimum.

Finally not all countries cost the same (obviously) if you need to drop costs, stay more time in Guatemala and less time in Costa Rica. More time in Bolivia, less time in Chile/Argentina.

I like your idea of traveling with your own vehicle. Be aware that it can be a hassle to get cars into new countries.. I haven't done it, but heard that it's basically impossible to import cars into Bolivia at the moment, don't know how this affects you as a tourist though.",1632213755,hdp3a36,t3_psaf67,/r/solotravel/comments/psaf67/how_can_i_save_enough_money_to_go_on_a_solo/hdp3a36/,1,solotravel

It does not make for a safe first solo trip at all. Understanding that in some middle Eastern countries tattoos are not allowed to be visible in places of worship or musuems is also important to note.

By my reckoning you need to save (48/18,000) **375** USD per month each month from now to departure.

fanboyhunter,t2_81t69,"It just isn't worth it. I mean, there are plenty of amazing things to see. We have great natural parks, some really cool cities, and lots to get lost in between. 

Yes, the cookie-cutter nature of the franchise system makes every place seem pretty similar.

But the biggest problem is how big of a chunk ""work"" takes out of our lives. Let's say you work 40 hours a week. You get the weekend off to do chores, shopping, maybe catch a game/movie/concert, see friends, or take a short trip somewhere closeby you enjoy. Get out into nature or see relatives. 

Maybe once a year, you can go on vacation for 1-2 weeks. Either you can't get much time off work, or you can only save so much money for a trip. Or both.  

On top of that, it's damn expensive to travel domestically. Hotels average over $130 or so per night in the US , maybe even higher. There aren't really hostels. There aren't really guest houses. AirBnB isn't really any cheaper than a hotel anymore. You'll likely be eating every meal out, paying for ubers, etc. 

Domestic flights are actually pretty expensive too. I've flown between European countries many times for cheaper than a domestic ticket in the US. Same with Southeast and South Asia.

Driving is a good option if you have a car and don't need to rent one. Gas is expensive though. If you need multiple days to make your trip, you then have to add in lodging, food, etc. to the ""travel cost."" Plus you're eating into your time, which is the problem in the first place. You don't get much time off from work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about this a lot since living in South Asia for the last 2 years. The other big problem in the US is the fact that most leases require a minimum of 12 months. You just can't live a mobile lifestyle unless you're filthy rich, you work seasonally, or you live in a van/RV/car.

I can roll up to just about any town or village on my bike and find a guest house for no more than $10 per night - usually half that price. So many times, I've decided to ""move"" to another area/beach/village and just showed up in town . . . it's so easy to find a place to crash for a few nights as you look for other options. And you can end up staying a week, a month, or longer ongoing. No sweat. No contracts. 

If I didn't have to sign a 12 month contract just to find housing, which then required me to work a ton of hours at a job I didn't care for just to pay for my existence . . . I'd love to travel more of the US. That's what I think is so liberating about the whole ""van life"" idea. You can actually just go and travel without a plan, without a time limit, etc.",1632221184,hdpbfjz,t3_ps9etg,/r/solotravel/comments/ps9etg/any_other_americans_feel_like_travelling/hdpbfjz/,1,solotravel

Paris is a pretty anonymous city, no one really cares what other people do (source: am parisian) so feel free to sit in a restaurant, no one will judge you for being alone. It's actually pretty common here, whether it's people traveling or on business trips or just chilling with a book.

About meeting people, I guess it would be pretty difficult making long lasting connections with Parisians if you're here for a few days. It's nothing to do with you or your height, Paris is a really touristy city so we see lots of people coming and going, and most of our social circle is people who live here. 

I prefer traveling in hostels to meet people, but I get the covid fear. Maybe a private room in a hostel could be a compromise? Otherwise I think walking tours or visits are your best bet.

geezeer84,t2_boj0h0tn,"Welcome to adult life ;)

The thing with solo travelling is, that it can confront you with multiple problems at once. The body doesn't play along, accommodation is not as expected, feeling onf loneliness, ...

I think, first of all, you should call your family and get some confidence (let them encourage you). Maybe talk to your father or brother (if you have). Mothers tend to be scared and want their children back.

Then, after that, you must go to a hospital. The internet just told me that English is very widely spoken in the bigger cities of Portugal. Don't think of your insurance. The internet also told me that health care in Portugal is provided by the state. Health care is free for nationals &amp; residents. So, there will be something similar for tourists, I guess.

So, after your confidence is built up and you got your body sorted, you have the time to figure out a new place to stay.

You know, when being on yourself, you can always have multiple problems at the same time. The trick is to prioritize each problem.

If I were you, I would stay. Otherwise you would set back your personal development.",1632120807,hdkazij,t3_prhueh,/r/solotravel/comments/prhueh/first_day_of_solo_travel_ever_porto_portugal_i/hdkazij/,12,solotravel

love_sunnydays,t2_420ptg7z,"Hey there!

1. Depends on how much time you have, but four countries is already a lot for a month, especially Italy and France in which you could spend a month each without getting bored

2. Both of these countries have great train networks, however when you get to the countryside travelling from the train station to your destination can be a bit of a hassle. I could answer more specific questions if you have some

3. All the countries you listed are fairly close and have common borders, except Greece for which I think you'll need a plane. I'd try to do them in order (Poland-Germany-France-Italy) to minimize travel days. Rome2rio is a great site to visualise the options between cities

4. Personally I'd advise against a luggage with wheels as you'll be moving around a lot, in old cities where you'll generally need to walk and take stairs often. I prefer to travel with a backpack and a smaller daypack that fits inside it (or a messenger bag). Head over to r/onebag or r/heronebag for advice on how to pack lightly!

5. Should be plenty, I just came back from 2 weeks in Italy where I spent less than 1k staying in hostels, visiting lots of stuff and eating in restaurants at least once a day

Switzerland is definitely on the expensive side but it could work with your budget.

cafeescadro,t2_fk7am,"&gt;A lot of your statements seem like problems that have always existed but are currently being exacerbated by the situation. In all honesty, this is not something a redditor will be able to fix for you. You likely need to see a therapist and work on self confidence and reducing comparing yourself to others and laying off the self deprecation. You’ll also need to learn how to enjoy your own company while traveling - this is something that can’t really be taught. Try doing solo things at home where you’re familiar, like going to a restaurant, club, bar, concert, etc.

thegorydetails,t2_kn7bw,"If I were you, I wouldn't add another country. For a month, I would stick to 2 countries. I spent a month just in Italy and France hitting some of the top highlights only. This is especially true if you want to take buses and trains and if you want places like the countryside instead of just main cities. If you do 4-5 countries, that is one per week. You'll spend most of your month in transit or rushing and only seeing the most touristy things. 

I've only ever been to Italy and France on your list but I found the trains very easy to figure out. I did pay as you go, I didn't get a rail pass. For my needs, it was cheaper. As a fellow train lover and as someone who was on a budget, I chose cheaper, slower trains over the expensive speedy ones. 

Wheely bags in Europe can be a nightmare. I would choose a backpack 100%. I'm a dedicated Osprey Farpoint user. I agree with the advice to check r/onebag. 

Your budget is fine. I spent $4000-4500 for 5 weeks in 2013, though I only stayed in dorms and ate cheaply (edit:, including flights from North America, hotels the first and last nights, and paying entry to anything I wanted, plus a lottt of drinks).

On my first solo trips I would always choose a fast food or take away and eat in a park or at the hotel/hostel because I was feeling akward at the idea to be in a restaurant on my own. But after a few trips, I decided to do it anyway because it was a bit sad to be there and not try the local cuisine, so I made sure to have a book or my travel diary with me and I could read or write while waiting for my food. After a few times, I started not to mind anymore, I also feared to be refused at nice places because I was on my own and not looking the best (I wear very confy clothes and shoes when walking around a place over the day, but even in higher tier restaurants, I've mostly been well welcomed and not felt pitied or whatever because I was on my own. 

It's a bit sad that you had to lie about being here with friends, you shouldn't be ashamed to be travelling on your own, lots of people actually are impressed by solo travellers (I've often heard I'm brave to be travelling on my own). If you want to meet up with the people you met, you can either tell them the truth and apologize, or, just say your friends wanna stay in tonight or do something you're not into.

I've been travelling solo for nearly 15 years and I love it. But I'm too shy to just start talking to people, if people talk to me, than, yes, no problem. So, I often spend a lot of times on my own when travelling solo. I am honest, I sometimes get bored at night because I feel uncomfortable going to a bar or club alone at night. But the bar of the hotel/hostel, it's OK. Also, lots of hostel have private rooms, so you can enjoy privacy and mingle in the social areas. I sometimes join small group tours, for a day or more. I also am quite confortable being alone with myself, even at home. I've been single for ever, I live and work on my own, I do lots of things on my own, so travelling solo was not too hard, but I also had the advantage that when I started to travel on my own I was using the Couchsurfing platform (when it was still good) and I was staying at someone's place or meeting with the local community. You could also maybe join a Meet Up ([meetup.com](https://meetup.com)) and meet locals, I live in Berlin and we sometimes have solo travellers join us to connect with the locals.

I find it great that you did beat your social anxiety and talked with people. I hope you'll really enjoy your trip and will get good advice from Reddit. :-)",1632124750,hdkfita,t3_prmfgx,/r/solotravel/comments/prmfgx/solo_traveling_rn_and_just_feel_super_sad_and/hdkfita/,3,solotravel
MaxDusty66,t2_e35ccavx,"I have been to Paris a few times alone and really, don't get down on yourself or feel out of place. unlike the US, it isn't very common for strangers to start a conversation out of the blue  in the middle of the street, it has nothing to do with rudeness but because they respect one's privacy. Small talk is generally something a little foreign to those from other countries, except maybe the Americans and Australians lol.  There's a  time and place where it's more generally common to introduce yourself and chat, such as gatherings, clubs, events etc. Also have to ask, do you speak French? Sometimes while a good portion of French people can speak and understand English, it's not the  language some are  most comfortable conversing in. 
It's also normal to eat alone, at cafes, restaurants there, now where you might not  see it often  is at  the fancy expensive places where you usually go with family or friends for  special occasions. Also most dining at tourist restaurants are tourists travelling with family do they're not often alone there, but go to where locals typically eat and it's normal to see people dining alone. 
 Where you will meet and get to talk to people are with those who are visitors to the country like yourself - you meet them at hotel bars, restaurants ,  hostels,  tour groups etc.  Something about traveling encourages those who may not otherwise socialize as much  in their own country to lose a bit of that trepidation as you're all pretty much in the same boat in a foreign land you may not know too much about.

Others already suggested that they are stress related. I tend to agree. Please find the nearest hospital and go to the emergency room. 

I have been to Lisbon (though with a friend) and had massive stomach cramps during our flight - due to anxiety/stress or my then recent antibiotic regimen, I don't know. I even passed out. We went to the nearest hospital and everything went fine. Thwy spoke English and I was able fo communicate my symptoms. They took good care of me and provided an adequate prescriptions. Waiting to be called up was a bit stressful as the PA speaker was calling out in Portuguese, but everything else was fine. (Am German and EU citizen, though, so I don't know about insurance/costs).

As for the other problems: You bought a service and have a right to demand a working door and internet. Talk to your landlord. If they don't do anything, ask for a refund and get another place - you can chose on site now.

As for the neighbourhood - maybe it is just foreign and strange. South European cities have a certain flair and can be intimidating. Familiarize yourself with your new environment. I am sure the feeling of being creeped out will go away.

You have all the right ideas and intentions. Keep it up. You got this. Yes, it's lonely at first, but it is an experience you will always recall. You will grow and build self-confidence and independence. It will change you. And you will learn from your mistakes, too - you will get to know yourself and hour boundaries better.

If you don't want to be so alone, go to [hostelworld.com](https://hostelworld.com) and find a hostel wherein reviewers say it has a great atmosphere, caring staff, easy to meet people, they organize tours, etc. Book a room there- private if that's your thing and then sign up for some group activities through the hostel.  It'll allow you to meet people and get out of your head via having something to do. If I were you, I'd sign up for a tour/activity each day for the next few days. Being alone in an Airbnb is not gonna be a fun time- get out and see the city and surround yourself with other people! (even if just temporarily!)

Ending up in lodging that isn't ideal happens semi-frequently to me. I just change the next night (or sometimes leave my booking early and lose a bit of $$) - no big deal! And don't worry about being able to contact family- you have a SIM card, use FB messenger or whatsapp, and you'll be good to contact whoever 24/7. Easy. I've been quite a few places with shitty internet as well- that happens. Luckily the vast majority of places you stay at will have solid internet. Again, I'd recommend moving to a new place- a highly rated hostel in a major city will nearly certainly have decent WiFi.",1632137293,hdku4wu,t3_prhueh,/r/solotravel/comments/prhueh/first_day_of_solo_travel_ever_porto_portugal_i/hdku4wu/,3,solotravel

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"Travel will pull you out of the familiar, which is to be expected and actually a good thing. Any time I take a trip, I prepare a detailed itinerary, which I find grounding and very helpful -- and I still find things sometimes don’t unfold according to plan. If you’re lucky, it’ll just be little things, such as an unexpected restaurant closure or an attraction taking less time than anticipated. You can minimize these with good planning, but you can’t eliminate them.

You have to be willing to improvise a little at times, and again, that’s normal. In fact, that’s true of life in general. Look at travel as an adventure, something different and exciting, not as a scary thing. Be prudent of course, but don’t worry about stuff either.

If you haven’t already, explore online the things you can do in Porto — museums, historic houses, beaches, area hikes, restaurants, day trips. Consider a jaunt to Lisbon, or a smaller city after researching things you can do. Keep yourself busy and pepper your days with things to do. You won’t have time to worry if you’re exploring all kinds of new things.

Easy to say and hard to do perhaps, but push past the worry and get yourself out and about. Dive into where you are.

YesAmAThrowaway,t2_9iujntvw,"Inform yourself of the currents (anywhere north of Crete will drift you towards Crete VERY quickly), EU requirements and supply stations for pumping sewage, fuel and getting electricity beforehand. Plan an itinerary and stick to it. Maritime communication at sea is the same around the world, so make sure to tune into the shipping forecast. Mooring spots at marinas usually have to be pre-booked, so get in touch with the local port authorities.

Secure things against the wind. Have emergency rations if your engine breaks, although usually a boat is within a few hours distance, especially ferries of all kinds. The maritime radar (if satellite internet is available on-board) app is a great tool.

Otherwise ***listen to the shipping forecast*** and read it, check up on it regularly. The Agean Sea can be anything from a calm angel to a raving maniac, so don't go anywhere if the waves are too high/stay close to islands and at lower speed. I'm sure the rental provider will give you some instructions as well.

EU:

From all I know, boating and shipping license requirements depend on the size of the vessel, its engine power, speed and purpose. You can't drive a catamaran ferry travelling at 56 knots with a sports boat license, just as an example. That's why it's really important you check for availability of boats you're allowed to operate, because they do indeed exist.

How did they like the city so far?

Having traveled a lot and been guilty of this in the past, I think a lot of people try to make traveling their personality when there's nothing else that makes them feel interesting or gives their life meaning. 

You express annoyance and frustration that your friends don't seem to continuously ask you about your travels but then in the very next paragraph say you are *irritated* about having to *pretend* to care about what they are interested in? You want the focus to be entirely on you but not on them. This is some serious entitlement. 

You are not better or more interesting than everyone else around you because you choose to spend your entire life savings on solo travel.

justalilargentinean,t2_em8dje69,"Hi everyone! :)

I (27F) will be visiting Florence solo at the end of October, from the 21st to the 26th. I've got a nice little itinerary sorted (nothing I love more than spending hours elbow-deep in TripAdvisor), so now I'm looking for advice on the more... specific inconsequential matters, from anyone who's familiar with that region of Italy. My questions are as follows,

1. I'm Argentinean and, despite living in a cold-ish European country for the last 8 years, I still dress like I'm in Buenos Aires. I am pretty confident and enjoy dressing on the sexier side of things, don't mind dealing with a little chill in order to bring a nice short dress out for spin, you get me. How rainy have you experienced N. Italy to be at the end of October? On the same vein... Any heel-wearing people got recommendations for a short block heel that is comfortable to walk around in all day? At 5' 1'', I like a bit of extra height when I can get it.
2. Is Tinder any good there? I'd like to arrange a date or 2 to keep busy after museums close, and maybe get to see a more local side to Florence. Perhaps even the interior design choices of those who live there, if the date ends well ;)  

3. How do you take nice pictures solo? Should I bother purchasing/carrying around a selfie stick? Is there a better, less in-your-face way you've found, bar asking strangers?  

4. Any personal favourites you want to recommend would be greatly appreciated! Local-loved food, drinks, sightseeing, I'm interested in all of it.

\-drop Malaga or cut it down to a day. Add a day to Barcelona and two to Madrid.

\-use your second day in Granada on a day trip to Cordoba. One day in the former for the Alhambra is good.

\-keep Seville at two days.

\-keep in mind that there are lots of great day and half day trips from Madrid. Toledo is a must, and places like El Escorial (half a day), Segovia, and Aranjuez are all well worth considering.

Barcelona has good museums and great Gaudi architecture. Madrid is a major museum destination — The Prado will take a full day, and there are several other worthy options to consider. Toledo and Segovia have excellent cathedrals, and both Toledo and El Escorial have worthy art museums.

bfjkgcfvjig,t2_elg14xlc,"Phoenix native, here’s my thoughts.

I would try to get your nature and hiking in on Thursday and Friday so you avoid some of the overcrowding of the trails. 

Thursday- Sedona. Idk when you get in Thursday but it will take you almost 2hrs to get to Sedona. Its beautiful there and is a really fun new-agey town. You could spend the whole day on hikes there. Oak creek is nearby and is a fun hike as well. Also check out the shops in tlaquepaque/downtown area. If you’re into anything like crystals, psychics etc this is your place.

Friday- Grand Canyon to start and then end your night in flagstaff. Flagstaff is a mountain-y sort of college town. There are some fun breweries and shops downtown where you could unwind after a day at the Grand Canyon. Flagstaff is about 45 min from Sedona and 1.5hrs from the Grand Canyon. Could stay at monte vista hotel downtown, it’s supposedly haunted.

 
Saturday- back to Phoenix. If you really want to hike more you could do camelback if you get there early in the morning. It will be packed since it’s the weekend. I think it’s overrated honestly. If you want some good views of phoenix you can also do Tom’s thumb trail, or any of the trails in dreamy draw as well. I think these hikes will all be kind of underwhelming after Sedona and grand canyon but they give you a city view if that’s what you want.

Saturday Day- you could do Phoenix art museum, Downtown Phoenix farmers market, shopping at Scottsdale fashion square, desert botanical gardens, Phoenix zoo, baseball game, etc…depends on your interests.

For nightlife, here are the three places you want to consider…

Scottsdale- boujee. Specifically Old Town Scottsdale. This will give you fancy and or/trendy restaurants and clubs. If you like clubs, pool parties, DJs, etc. this is where you’ll want to spend your night. Avoid North Scottsdale, which are just upscale suburbs.

Tempe- college town. Idk your age but Mill Ave is the nightlife for all of the ASU students. There’s other fun bars off of mill as well. If you’re in this age range and want to party it’s fun here.

Downtown Phoenix- artsy/hipstery/breweries. This is my preferred nightlife scene. Roosevelt arts district has a bunch of fun breweries. There are cool dinner spots (Cornish pasty, ocotillo) and it’s a more laid back scene than Scottsdale. You could see a show at crescent ballroom or the van buren. 

Keep in mind Tempe/Scottsdale/downtown phx are all like a 20-30 minute Uber from each other. You could do an fancy dinner in Scottsdale and end your night downtown.


Sunday-could hit Papago park or one of the other local hikes, just get there early to avoid crowds and heat. The airport is pretty much between downtown phx and Tempe so any of the shops or restaurants in that area will keep you close to the airport. It’s a pretty easy to navigate airport and not crazy busy.

Don’t waste your time going to Tucson.

- Watched as a group of black refugees were chased by cops for selling clothes in the street, it was disheartening. Overall black people just have a lower standard of living there.

If you read again (hopefully I expressed it well) I travelled 3 years having a 9-5 job. I added to my schedule a new trip each month. I had planned 3 trips in advance while I still was working.

It was a way to keep myself accountable. The flight was paid, so I had to go. Sometimes I was very lazy and tired to travel because I had very tiring weeks of work. But the fact of having done so, helped me to prevent burnout and also grow in an accelerated way.

2017 was a crazy year, with sometimes 3 trips in a month.

ShivaIV,t2_elgt56jf,"I usually solo travel once per year, and I'm also a woman in my 40s, and I have two cats, so I will give you my input.

I don't know about the travel nurse perspective, but if you never did this, you probably should start with smaller periods, one or two months at first, and later expand it into longer periods once you are more confortable with it.

For the pets there are pet hotels but those can get very expensive for longer periods. The really best solution is to have a trusted friend where you can just leave the pets and know they will live in peace until you get back. If you don't have someone like that, an alternative is pet-sitters, those will usually be much cheaper than hotels, you can see their reviews before commiting to anything, and they will act like a temporary family to your pets.

About the travelling itself, many hostels will have women-only rooms, and if you do have the money for it, renting a full apartament might be an option, could even be very affordable if you are travelling to a country where the cost of living is much lower than your country.",1631962635,hdbgjxf,t3_pq1z7t,/r/solotravel/comments/pq1z7t/solo_travel_as_a_woman_in_my_40s/hdbgjxf/,1,solotravel

Check for the latest COVID restrictions. Also, check any museum or other attraction you may want to visit, as timed and prepaid entry may be required (this has been more common post-COVID).

properfckr,t2_dgcvejtx,"Dear Ms. 40 year-old nurse lady with cats,

One of the many joys of travel is that you get to leave your own self-definition and confining beliefs about life behind, in your previous life ""at home"". 

However, if you insist on bringing these definitions with you, then the rest of us have no choice but to see you through that lens. 

The desire to leave one's home and start a new, different, unknown life abroad is partly driven by the desire to be a new person, shed old skins and create new versions of oneself. 

Therefore, I submit to you that you are not a stereotype, nor do you have anything to be ashamed of or feel unworthy, or less-than about. 

I, like many other solo travellers you will encounter, do not give a jot about your age, or with whom and what you share your home, etc. When in the wilds of Peru, let's say, you can be whomever you want to be, and leave whatever aspects of yourself you do not wish to focus upon, back home with your cats. 

The cats... you are trying to straddle two worlds right now: the known, and the unknown. The self-definition you have, and are attempting to transcend, and the free-spirited, adventurous self you are wanting to create.

You want to be the free spirit who takes off to exotic locales and lives a life of adventure, whilst maintaining your creature comforts and cats. I'm sure you can see the contradiction here. 

I love cats. I love dogs. I love pets, and have had many throughout my life of 59 years. If you truly do love your pets, you would never think of taking them on the road intercontinentally. As you know, cats especially do not share our sense of adventure. 

Although you may find living in Bangkok stimulating and invigorating, your cats will not. And there are many Thai cats, dogs, snakes, rats, people who may not take kindly to your beloved feline friends either. 

In order to let go and explore anew, you need to let go. 

I share your predilection for a private bathroom and a comfortable place to stay. If you travel for long periods of time, like many months, rather than a few weeks, you will need down time, a place to relax and do nothing at all. 

Today's traveller has many more options than hostels. Other than in expensive places like Europe, hostels are unnecessary, as there is cheap, comfortable accommodation readily available everywhere else, and even in Europe too. 

Actually none of your fears are anything more than fear itself. And this is understandable! 

It has taken me almost five years to finally take the leap and move my life from the comforts of Canada. 

I would suggest you take your time as well. One of the great things about being a nurse is that you can work anywhere in the world, as everyone needs nurses, especially now!

Travel to the countries which interest you to see what the vibe is like. It may be great to visit Italy as a tourist, but a very different matter to live day to day in the traffic and congestion of Rome. 

Send out professional feelers from home: contact agencies and organizations which work with nurses around the world kinda thing. If you get a nibble from Kenya, take a trip there first, before putting your cats into storage for a year - that was a joke!

Before my first solo trip as a 20 year-old going to Europe for the first time, I envisioned myself being a very different person on the streets of London than I was in Montreal. It was no less than a hard punch in the gut to realize that despite the long airplane ride and the new surroundings, I was still the same guy!

Transformation takes time. I was a different person at the end of that first solo voyage than I was at the beginning. 

You are in the midst of transforming yourself. Baby steps and small forays into the new will enable you to ease into this; it will also enable you to calm your fears, and discover what really is ""out there"", and where it is you will feel comfortable living. 

This is no small feat! 

The most important part of all of this is: Yes! You can do it. Yes! It is possible. Yes! This is a workable plan. Yes! You can have a private bathroom. Yes! You are that adventurous person, and you will support yourself in living your greatest life. 

Kind Regards,

Mark",1631975057,hdc230m,t3_pq1z7t,/r/solotravel/comments/pq1z7t/solo_travel_as_a_woman_in_my_40s/hdc230m/,1,solotravel

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"Will echo those who say this is waaaaay too fast and overstuffed. I’d either do just Colorado or Arizona, not both, for starters.

Regarding Denver and nearby, note well that the elevation may be an issue (also true of Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon). That’s especially true for Rocky Mountain National Park, Pikes Peak, and anything else actually in the mountains themselves. You should give yourself time to acclimate to the altitude, especially if you plan to do any hiking. Drink a lot of water during the day to help offset the effects, especially if you’re experiencing headaches or other physical symptoms, and wear a hat and sunscreen, as the sun’s effects are more acute and it’s very easy to burn. If you’re unlucky enough to experience altitude sickness, you may have to descend to a lower elevation.

 Much of Arizona (especially Grand Canyon and Phoenix) is desert, and things like dehydration and heat stroke can be fatal and can insidiously sneak up on you. All the advice about water, hats, and sunscreen hold here as well. Drink water throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty.",1631977126,hdc6ks7,t3_pp3ghe,/r/solotravel/comments/pp3ghe/rate_my_denverphoenix_itenerary/hdc6ks7/,1,solotravel

Stay in Sorrento, where you can take the train to Pompeii, Vesuvius, Herculaneum, and Naples as day trips, as well as Positano and Amalfi and Paestum by bus or Capri by ferry.

I know people might be like she doesn’t have to, but you can tell when someone energy is off. She gave me a room in the basement, well i specifically told her I like being on higher floors. There was literally no windows at all.  Funny thing was when i was going to the elevator she was like “ no smoking in here “, hmm sure. When I came back upstairs she was checking couple other people and none took the elevator down to the basement or during my entire stay Im convinced i was the only one down there. I also remembering whenever I was trying to exit, I would have to walk by the front desk,  I greeted her the first two times, and she wouldn’t reply.

Secondly I remember going to this restaurant on my last day, there were indoor and outdoor seatings. Walked in to the servers, he told me straight to please seat outside and someone would come. Mind you, it was a chilling evening, well didn’t think much of it until I stayed out there for about 20min and no one shows up, I just stood up and left.

Bandisdik,t2_cplxxi0r,"It's 10 am here in Monterrey I just got up from going out last night but this post caught my eye as i was doing some lazy browsing.

&amp;#x200B;

First I just want to say that I hate framing things in a  that's just me and I say that for contrast to how I've been feeling for a while with regards to traveling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 30 year old black man from the Tri state area. I have been on this current trip for 3 months exploring the whole of Mexico with Central and South America up next. I fund this from my savings working in tech.

&amp;#x200B;

On to my experiences. On the whole my experiences traveling have been great. Mexico is the second country I've done in depth, the other being Vietnam. Other than that I have done Thailand, Cambodia, Malysia and Jamaica which I don't really count because It's my parents home and I JUST for the first time did some tourist shit there. SEA i was treated very well by the locals and I felt safe 99% of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing about it that was a little annoying was the picture taking. I would get asked to take a picture ALL THE TIME. One time I even stood at the base of a staircase up a mountain and had my picture taken with locals and other Asian tourists for, I shit you not, 10 minutes straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that surprised me is how much this happens in Mexico. My thought was that there was enough black people coming to all parts of Mexico as well as Afro Latinos that they would be used to our presence. In Asia I got mad at the pictures at first but I got over it realizing that  I am probably the first black person a lot of them have ever seen. In Mexico this is not how I'm feeling and I get a little annoyed. Maybe I am just ignorant to how present black people are here.

Sexual relationships is something I think about a lot and how race affects that. I am, if i can toot my own horn; a charming, intelligent, well spoken and funny guy who also is a beast on the dance floor, awesome at drinking games and just the life of the party when I feel like being it. Also I've been told basically since puberty how very physically attractive I am. I highlight my qualities to show what I bring to the table in comparison to basic white or mexican guys. I have the idea that race has some influence on my success or lack there of with a lot of women on the road but I know other factors come into play mostly my difference from other people; I am not simple and I like my crazy ass. But it still feels like dorky, less attractive white guys have an easier time with the ladies than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

But other than those two areas, traveling is always fun for me. I have always felt welcome wherever I go and dont have trouble that would stem from my race.",1631978863,hdcaft6,t3_pqdw2x,/r/solotravel/comments/pqdw2x/black_solo_travelling_men_how_are_your/hdcaft6/,10,solotravel

Just get the oui.sncf app and you book your train tickets on there. Easy peasy. I often would buy tickets on my way to the station. I went to Ventimiglia and Monaco (first V then M on the way back), Antibes and then JLP for the beach. I also went to Cannes to see a friend of mine. She actually works for a boat tour company so I did a tour around Nice. 3 years ago I took a tour to St Tropez with them as well  I liked seeing it but I wasn't all that impressed. I would probably stay in JLP again and not Nice. I also stayed on Montpellier for a few days except I got sick and had to stay home to be near a toilet for 3 days. I did an evening trip to Sète but I was still feeling a little off so mostly just walked around and ate. I'm a single female and felt really safe.

jaqow,t2_11ogbi,"Indeed I'm not sure if there's such a market for just pushing people to face their fears. Watching people do it on youtube can already help - which might be one thing that you can monetize. As someone who feel stuck, I could be one of your client. Lucky for me, I found another human on the other side of the world that would be a solid reason for me to work on traveling to get to him. My only problem is being from a 3rd world country, it's not as easy as up and go. I can barely get any chance for a visa. A lot of people here won't understand but it's soooooooooooooooooooo hard. Even I got a work contract and still got denied. How unlucky can I get? But I'm not stopping. Even with vaccine passports: imagine getting a vaccine only for them to tell you, ""oh we don't recognize that vaccine here, sorry you can't come."" It's every bit of tragic comedy my plans are. My sure plan is just to land a job (again) and finally put a nail on that work visa. Studying isn't much of an option because I don't really have that much money to study abroad.  


Anyway, when everything aligns perfectly, what I would hire is someone to help me put my visa application together. I feel I caught trauma from the couple of visas I applied to and failed. Even tho I have an experience applying for one, I don't wanna go through it alone anymore. I don't want that burden alone anymore. It's too much. Maybe some doesn't see it that way but for someone who feels that they're misplaced and that there's nothing here for them anymore (wherever that ""here"" is), to say it's heartbreaking is an understatement.

So why not offer a little bit of that? I'm curious, how long before you acquired papers to legally stay in Spain? You said when you finished school, you didn't go back and broke the rules. This is something I'm too scared to do but I'm glad everything went well in the end for you. We only live once. My greatest fear as of now is to get stuck where I am, where I don't find anything significant for me anymore, where I'm just so alone when everyone else is starting to build their lives, I got nothing.",1631884206,hd7bogw,t3_ppvq87,/r/solotravel/comments/ppvq87/solo_travel_transformation_story_30_countries_in/hd7bogw/,8,solotravel

Fmanow,t2_xmdtl,"I think what you’re thinking of is a life coach or something along those lines, but you need some kind of solid background that your client’s will value and pay for. And typically these clients tend to be people with money and thus will need to be swayed by your past experiences to take you on as someone that can help them. First off, it’s always funny to me when people say my English is bad and they go on a do a write up that I know a lot of native English speakers couldn’t muster, specially without using short cut words and over 160 characters. I’m sure you worked on your English skills and became better, so you have that in you, to keep improving yourself and overcoming obstacles. And so this is just another obstacle. However, I think you should consider changing this idea of trying to monetize an activity you like doing and actually find a job that will allow you to fulfill your desire for travel, which might be your true passion. Helping people is nice, but there are many ways to help people in a form of a career, where you actually have income and the helping part is a byproduct of the job. If you want to help people overcome their fears and so forth, try to find a career that ultimately will help people achieve a better place in their lives, but just as a consequence of your job. Like tech people help small businesses start websites or something. I really can’t tell you what that is, because you need to take some steps back and figure out what that can be for you. Right now you’re focused on finding individual clients who may need your help, yet the help they seek typically requires many years of education and experience in the medical field, like psychology or something. I think you were on the right track of finding a career that can be remote, working from home or anywhere, and allowing you the freedom to travel. Or do what you did before; look at how it allowed you to travel all those years, and ultimately that’s what you want to keep doing.",1631887776,hd7jb39,t3_ppvq87,/r/solotravel/comments/ppvq87/solo_travel_transformation_story_30_countries_in/hd7jb39/,5,solotravel
travellikeagame,t2_5h2rmlpx,"Thanks for your honest reply.  
Yeah, it's totally unfair how some people have privilege for the place they were born. It's so annoying, and I can imagine how hard is to apply for a visa.

In my previous job, one former teammate from India didn't get his visa approved to go to our company event because he had some family in the US. They can pick anything to deny you. They thought maybe he was going with the intention to stay, or who knows.

Now there are opening up new opportunities with the digital nomad visas. If you make your own income online and can demonstrate it, you could apply to some of them. Portugal has an interesting kind of visa that works that way and opens the door to the Schengen area.

If you can, make a business or get a remote job. Don't wait to be hired by a company to move abroad, look for a company that hires you to work from anywhere. Nothing is easy, but if you get an income online, it's the first step. Freelancing is another option (but not ideal)

In my case, I got a student visa. So I was renewing my papers every year (a big pain). Luckily my ex-girlfriend told me that we could do a civil union, so I could ask for the residence. So in my third year living there, we carried on a civil union and I requested the residence. Spain and Chile for historical reasons have an agreement that, if you live as a resident after 2 years you can ask for citizenship, so I did. It took another 3 years until finally, I got it. A lot of patience is required as well.

tryingitonemoretime1,t2_4dkpic65,"There are many options for someone like you. But some of them may not be for you.

I meet a lot of 40+ travelers. They have had a ton of different ways they have had to do solo trips. A few of them have animals. Usually a dog. Sometimes a cat. Figure out if your animals are comfortable traveling first. Take them on day trips one at at time. Then both at the same time. Get them use to leashes, crates and being comfortable in the car. 

One way of traveling in the IS has already been said. Trusted travelers is a great way to sit in one spot and enjoy someone else's property. Sometimes if you are house sitting with someone who has animals you can get paid. 

Hipcamp is like Airbnb for camping. Sometimes it's just tents. But other times you might be in a yurt, or a cabin. There are even spots where you can pull up in an RV. They're scattered all over the country. Not just near extremely busy tourist spots. I've stayed in hip camps and the middle of nowhere Utah. 

Solo travel is more about planning than anything. The resources are out there to figure out where to stay. But the actual travel is much more difficult for most people. Having to plan weather events, internet availability, budget, and just not taking too much stuff. The more you take the more your bogged down. 

I've met many people who play camp hosts. They don't make a lot of money but that's a free place to stay. I've met people in the Los Angeles area all the way to Northern Montana that do that all the time. They love it.

I wouldn't recommend doing the golden circle tour, but if you have no transportation I guess it's a way to see highlights. The stops are all interesting in their own rights but showing up with100 people or so at a time kills the experience.

The best things to see are a bit further out of Reykjavik and the city itself is quite expensive if not eating from the local grocery stores.

A glacier tour, glacial lagoon, one or two of the more popular waterfalls (gulfoss and skogafoss?), and if you can manage the volcano would be my top sites to hit.

As far as the lights - the more night you have the more likely you're going to have chance but the weather changes rapidly and if paying for a tour there is no guarantee for anything and you might have to try every night.

Here’s what I found was key.  Make sure it’s a large and family friendly resort. Adult only is basically couples on honeymoons. Small resorts are basically small groups. Family resorts have people anywhere from couples families friends and everything in between.  Enjoy what you want. Buffets may be more comfortable if you feel self conscious if eating alone else bring a book and play in your phone. Large resorts have a ton of dining options and activities

Large resorts also offer more anonymity and opportunities to meet other people. Just grab a drink at any bar and likely be talking to someone in no time

The point is, a lot of people have an idealize the prospect of traveling, especially alone, but they don't have any idea of the ramifications, the cost, or what can actually come from the experience aside from, 'wow, seeing x place at x time would be so cool!' Seeing new places is great, especially profoundly beautiful places, but travel, especially solo, is and has so much more to offer than that. It also requires far more sacrifice than most people are capable of allowing themselves to give. But if you really want to travel and you really embrace the experience, make it possible, you'll find and discover so much more than just having been a few 'nice places.'",1631813329,hd3qb1y,t1_hcz6xjt,/r/solotravel/comments/porozs/the_great_odyssey_of_my_life_is_complete/hd3qb1y/,3,solotravel

It is very near Volcano Arenal where the swimming pool water and the hot mineral water  running through the premises is heated by the magma associated with the volcano.   In fact, I have been three times because I enjoyed the place so much.  Each time, I went with a travel group and had no problem in talking with quite a number of people.  I have not spent a night there, but I would.

I think going solo to this resort for 3-4 days would be just fine - it is such a nice place to escape from all the discord in our lives and world at present.  Sitting under that small waterfall and having that warm water cascade over me has the power to rinse all negativity away from my body and mind.

I also aim at staying in rooms of 6-8 people (fewer than six sometimes feels awkwardly intimate, more than 8 increases the risk of noise and lights being switched on and off multiple times during the night). And I bring headphones and a power bank to make it easier.

However, I try to do the best of both: When I travel for several weeks or months, I usually alternate so I spend a few days in a hostel followed by a few days in an apartment or hotel. That way it doesn't really matter if a hostel once in a while doesn't live up to my standard as I'll have quite alone time in the next location.

To those posters, I want to say, Be Honest with yourself:  if you really need/want a travel buddy, then find one. And if you don’t have friends to go with you, then there are other ways—join a group tour, plan deliberate activities where you definitely will be in a group, and I’ve seen MeetUp.com groups specifically for people who like to travel and want to meet others.

For example, I am current resident of Strasbourg which has the most famous Xmas market in France, nearby Colmar has equally beautiful Xmas markets.  Neither town had announced Xmas market dates thus far.  Even though there are dozens of web sites with Strasbourg/Colmar Xmas market dates, they are not the official tourism web sites of Strasbourg/Colmar. No Xmas market announcement on the official tourism web site of Vienna and Prague either so far.  Xmas market dates typically appear prominently on the home page of official tourism web sites after summer. Official Tourist Office web site of Nürnberg and Cologne had announced their Xmas market dates. 

The must-see Xmas markets I typically recommend to first-timers are: Strasbourg/Colmar (France), Nürnberg &amp;other Bavarian towns (Germany), Vienna/Salzburg (Austria), Prague (CZ).  I had visited at least 50 Xmas markets in Germany. If you only visit one country for Xmas market, Germany is definite the best choice.  I had visited Amsterdam's Xmas market (as day-trip while living in Cologne), it was disappointingly small and not-festive, by comparison. 

The weather in December is most likely very cold/rainy/gloomy/dark-by-4:30pm/possibly icy grounds.  Without Xmas markets, towns are not so beautiful at this time of year. If the town happens to have large number of indoor sights/attractions (museums/palaces..etc) you could still have fun if Xmas market is cancelled in the last minute or lousy weather.   

German Xmas markets typically ends before Xmas.  Xmas markets in Prague/Strasbourg typically run until early January but close on Dec 25.  This year, Dec 26 and January 2 are Sundays, which means stores are likely to be closed from afternoon of Dec 24 and re-open on Dec 27, closing early on New Year's Eve and re-open on January 3.  You would be better off in big towns during these 2 closure period, as some shops catering to tourists likely stay open. 

It would be prudent for you to contact each town's tourist office directly to confirm if their Xmas market would go forward, if no Xmas market date is announced on the town's OFFICIAL tourism web site.  You should also ask if the sights/monuments you want to visit stay open during the Xmas/New Year closure period.  Do not google ""Strasbourg Christmas market"", google ""Strasbourg official tourist office"" instead to find the OFFICIAL tourist office web site.",1631702829,hcxocmb,t3_pnr3w0,/r/solotravel/comments/pnr3w0/best_destinations_for_travel_during_christmas/hcxocmb/,2,solotravel
maniacal_Jackalope-,t2_3qzv5nmt,"I visited several places in Korea by myself when I lived there, and I went to Japan and Australia completely solo. In Australia I ended up meeting some really nice people, however they initiated.
 I get overly anxious and I spend too much energy focusing on others I’m traveling with, that I end up making myself miserable and miss out on what I want to see. Which is why I prefer traveling solo. 

The only time I wished I had someone with me was when I visited Fushimi Inari Taisha a second time at night to beat the crowd and walking through the gates became creepy and I heard some weird distant flute music and a cat jumped out of nowhere and I ended up sprinting back and startling a group of high school boys.",1631703344,hcxp22e,t3_poa3zt,/r/solotravel/comments/poa3zt/does_anyone_here_actually_travel_alone/hcxp22e/,2,solotravel

DjKeyhole,t2_2ymsrobj,"As I got older I realized that I had no desire to go with a hostel group / college friends / anyone to a big huge bar to drink shitty overpriced drinks.  It gave me social anxiety and I would drink more.  I put two and two together and realized that was just not an experience I liked.

I do like craft beer, bourbon, and wine though.  It's a passion of mine, and I'm pretty deep into a collecting rabbit hole on most of those.  I found I had a bunch of great experiences going to a cool brewery or whiskey bar while traveling and chatting with the bartenders.  I've found that most of the people working in those places have a passion as well.  At the hyped breweries at home, I typically go up alone to pick up my membership beer and talk with the brewers and staff.  I've learned a lot that way, and it's a different experience than when I'm out socially to drink.

For wine - I also am not a big fan of the party bus style wine tastings where everyone gets plastered.  No one is there to learn anything or actually buy wine.  Even in small groups I find that I can get too technical in my questions about the wine for others to maintain interest.  If I'm going to purchase wine I prefer a more intimate experience.  Most groups I've been with are only there to drink.

Sometimes these more individual experiences have led to some pretty cool intimate experiences while traveling.  I've been invited to private wine tastings in Burgundy, brewed my own beer recipe in Latvia, after hour whiskey tastings with the staff in Paris, and beer shares all over.  Passion can take you places.",1631713235,hcy6cxf,t1_hcw6f5i,/r/solotravel/comments/poa3zt/does_anyone_here_actually_travel_alone/hcy6cxf/,24,solotravel
elperroborrachotoo,t2_4rc3q,"**Quote:** you are as alone as you want to be.  
(Doesn't always work that way, but pretty good on average.)

**General:** The great thing about solo is: you are in control. It's your choice (provided you have the energy to act on it). Hostel's to busy for you? Move on! Ended up in a laid-back crowd planning to go for dinner tomorrow and *you actually like the idea*? Stay another day!

**Personal:** My level of comfort is: explore stuff on my own, and half th time hang out with people in the evening. A day-trip with a group from time to time. 

Solo taught me pretty well how little ""human contact"" I need to get through a month, but also how desperate I can become for it if that little bit is removed. (great prep for Corona). 

**Why we talk so much about when we hung out with people:**

It's attention bias. You can spend 10 hours on a plane and 10 minutes swimming with dolphins - which experience will you talk more about?

I've seen enough things for a lifetime or two. I enjoy seeing more and again - but... even if there was a higher and wilder waterfall in a more exotic setting, it wouldn't *top* my experiences, merely complement them. Old farts on the road agree: it's the people you remember that add meaning. 

**It's not about them, it's about you.** 
You might end up finding yourself a different person on the road, and you might find that fellow travelers are not the same fare as what your house's outside has to offer. 

You say you have social anxiety and you don't want to meet people. OK. Fine. Do just that. *You are in control.*

After arriving, the goal was to stay awake until sleep time… got my hotel room, stashed my stuff, and headed to a coffee shop.  

Two hours later I emerged from the coffee shop - and was totally lost.  Had no idea where I was, or how to locate the hotel.  Panicked.  Was before google maps was a thing - had no electronics to guide me.  My heartbeat still explodes when I think about it.  

Walked in circled for 15 min, then figured it out.  Kept close to the hotel the rest of the day.  

There can be some tense moments; can be some lonely ones.

crunk_crone,t2_n0esexj,"Definitely book a guided hike in person—- I went for 4 weeks in May/June just before high season. The Inca trail was actually closed due to COVID and the government was not issuing permits to companies. I ended up doing a 4 day 3 night Salkantay trail for about  $285 USD which I booked a week before. This was significantly cheaper than other guided treks were offering online for double the price. It is possible to do a private tour, but it would be more expensive. Even though I went at the cusp of high season, it was only me and one other American on the trip. The Salkantay is traditionally a 5 day 4 night hike, but I requested to shorten it as I have very little overnight camping/hiking experience and was unsure what I was getting into and the tour company arranged this for no extra cost. I’m unsure if Perú is now issuing permits for the Inca trail now and have very little info to share about that hike. Usually the cost of train and bus tickets back to Cusco is included with the guided hike and should be arranged by the travel agency you choose to book with. 
I stayed in and out of Kokopelli hostel in Cusco and loved it. The location is very close to the plaza de armas. The first time I stayed, they upgraded my 6 bed reservation to a 4 with a private bathroom. The staff was very friendly and the vibes were good. It’s not a crazy party hostel, but upstairs there is a bar where I met about 10-15 other travelers during my stay while learning to make pisco sours and playing beer pong. Only complaint here is the showers. Choose a room with less beds like a 4. The water pressure in the showers of the larger shared dorms felt like standing under the slow sad dribble of a man with BPH struggling to start a stream. If you’re looking for more of a party hostel, I’ve heard Loki is the spot to stay.
I also did a 2 week ayahuasca retreat in the sacred valley at a place called Arkana… the accommodations were excellent, but it was VERY expensive and the male shaman hit on me and another female guest resulting in his termination. Ayahuasca is a plant medicine that requires a lot of preparation before taking and would suggest doing more research. For example, you should not take it if on certain psychotropic medications due to the risk of serotonin syndrome which can be fatal as well as other dietary and lifestyle modifications to enhance the effects of the medicine. I prepped for a month prior and still do not feel like that was an adequate amount of time to maximize the benefits. Would start with San Pedro first, which is a very different medicine. I made a few contacts over there with people who were working at Arkana but have now started their own retreats but with San Pedro.

Think_Elevator5158,t2_8q7ebdzn,"Check Wizz Air and Ryanair for cheap flights to Eastern Europe - from a plethora of cities and small towns across the UK. You can easily fly to non Shenghen places like North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, Bosnia,  and I think Montenegro for &lt;£10. Whilst the Russia visa is expensive, you might be able to fly to Russia from London for &lt;£20 each way and do a triangle: London - Moscow - St Petersberg.

In terms of the UK, there are many places you can go:

1. **Shetland and Orkney**. These archipelagos are the Northern tip of the UK. They are very beautiful and not visited much. I used to travel the UK for work with an Arab face and I got nothing but abuse from small regional towns across England. I never really faced abuse in Scotland personally, or these small islands. Some people did presume I was a refugee from Syria though and would ask if I was resettled there and how I was finding it. Not sure their agenda there (welcome or understanding what's going on or what). I have been to the islands a few times but this time there was a trash Daily Mail article about resettling Syrian refugees to remote *outer hibriddes* Islands. These islands are beautiful in summer with nice mild weather and beautiful in winter too when the climate is nice. It's kind of like an inviting cool air. You can fly there from various parts of Scotland (check out logan air or look up the airport of these islands on wikipedia to get a list of routes) and island hop via boat or what not. There are local buses on each big island but check the timetables online. These islands have lots of history. They were given to what is now the UK from Denmark, Norway, or Denmark-Norway (I forgot which form those countries were in). The UK got a shittone of territorial waters and oil from this. Politically, those islands are likely to vote to stay in the UK if Scotland comes independent, and possibly come a crown dependency and so it is a major political issue. They used to speak old Norn there which is dead now, outside academia, but the language is still used for ceremonies. I speak regional UK languages (which there are many) due to being biracial. It's a shame those languages are dead but nice to see it. There is a poet there who writes and reads poetry in scotts language (inb4 ""that's not a language or dialect it's an accent). I like some of her poems but I've never met her or listened to a live reading.
2. **Faroes Islands.** These are an independent part of Denmark, I will let you look up the status. The islands are between Scotland and Iceland. They are responsible for their own immigration and tourist visas and I'm pretty sure they do not take up your 90 days (but I never needed to confirm as I also have an EU passport, even though you need a permit to go there).  You can't get there from Shetlands on a scheduled basis but I jumped on a finishing vessel some decade ago and did it. The country is stunning. The locals are very anti islam and arab though and quite far right towards non-white foreigners, except mail order brides from Asia which there are a substantial number of. I would not recommend black people or arabs or indians go. The country is stunning and great for walking and looking at natural wonders. You have to pay a license fee to walk in the countryside which is pretty expensive. You cannot go there from the UK and IIRC you can only fly from Norway or Denmark (so be careful with your 90 days if the airport doesn't have transfer facilities). You can fly on a codeshare ticket with Loganair, some other UK airline in scotland whose name I forgot, or a Norwegian airline to a isolated town in Norway in the Fjords. Actually leave there and experience it for a day. Then take the next flight to the Faroes. 
3. **Greenland.** This was my secret until Trump tried to buy it. It's pretty hard to visit so I'll just leave it here. You can't drive between settlements. 
4. **Outer Hibrides.** Small islands on the western edge of Scotland. Most people don't like these so I'll skip. But I like going there with older relatives and chilling. 
5. **Wales**. There are lots of lovely small towns in places deep in the country away from tourism. I go to travel North Wales and random small villages extensively because I was doing a project in Northern Wales some years ago and the colleague had a car. Then there are Welsh Train network which you can use as a backbone to travel. I like hearing the Welsh language, though I don't speak it. 
6. **Cornwall + Isles of Silly.** This is a Duchy and was never formally or legally incorporated into the UK. If you die resident in Cornwall without any heirs, for example, your estate doesn't go to the Crown by the Duchy of Cornwall, the second in like to the UK thrown. There is a STRONG identity here. I didn't even dare to call it regional. They speak Cornish here. I understand this even less than Welsh. There are some nice small town and seaside activities. The Isle of Silly (not sure if they are reopened due to CoVid - I haven't been in the UK for several years) are full of nice small towns. 
7. **Isle of Man**. This is a Crown Dependency between Ireland and the UK. It is not part of the UK at all, it is just a Crown Dependency. People there have British Citizenship but the Manx variant, with Manx passports. They were not EU citizens. I think the IoM is still completely closed off due to covid. They speak Manx. I can understand this. There are a few towns to see like Peel and Doglass. You can fly in from many places in the UK quite cheaply, but accommodation is a bit expensive. Best to visit in summer, but before the tourist season. 
8. **Isle of White.** This is the giant island south of the UK (it is part of the UK, don't be confused by this due to my placement of where I wrote about it). Most people hate this place but I'm sorry I love taking the hovercraft there and doing stuff like the cable car, riding the old tube trains on the Island line (I think they're gone now) and taking the chain ferry across town. Research the island fully before going to make sure youre not wasting time. 
9. **Channel Islands** \- Jersey. Not part of the UK and is it's own Crown Dependency. They speak Channel French here. Nice little island. I will let you research it. 
10. **Channel Island - Guernsey** (alderny and Sark - each has it's own government or something). As number 9. You can do a triangle.

CirqueDuTsa,t2_mg8mn,"As you probably know, Peru was a shit show some months ago with Covid.  People were dying outside the doors of the hospital waiting to get in.  Everyone I spoke with either personally knew someone who had died of Covid, or they had had it themselves.  One driver had it three times.  

As a result, EVERYONE is taking it seriously.  There is no anti-mask bullshit.  Everyone wears a mask in public. Some places require you to wear two masks.  The train requires a mask and a face shield.  99% of the businesses you go into, there's someone out front taking your temperature and giving you a squirt of hand sanitizer.

Businesses and tourism operations are running, but the government still doesn't seem to want a lot of foreign visitors.  They're letting people in, but the businesses that do complete MP packages can't operate so I had to book everything individually myself.  Other than that, the only thing I encountered was that Huayna Picchu, one of the two mountains of MP, was closed due to Covid.  I didn't look into doing any hikes.  I had no problem doing day trip bus tours around Cusco last minute.

People are hurting.  There are protests to get the government to open things up more.  I spent a few days in Cusco, mainly around the Plaza de Armas, and the vendors selling trinkets told me things were tough.  Some hadn't sold anything in four days.  They said 90% of the people coming to Cusco were Peruvians and they don't buy things like foreigners do.

One thing I wish I had done before I left was to take a bunch of them to a grocery store and give them a set amount they could spend.  With the exchange rate right now, I could have given a few people some meaningful relief.

The UK is very racist and in denial about it's racism. Whilst sometimes it is direct, like once my friend has curry thrown at them in Weatherspoons (iT's JuSt BaNtEr), it is mostly indirect and sole consuming, but as a tourist you are unlikely to notice it happening. An example is 10 years ago I was with my university friend in London. We were going to go to a pub to eat and drink and have a catch up. It was raining. We sat down and got dirty looks from the barmaid who said yOu HaVe tO BuY SoMeThInG If YoU wAnT To SiT HeRe with a bitch facial expression as if we were coming in to sit here. If you tell this to a British person they'd immediately try and whitesplain away the situation and deny it is racist. If you say that to a North American they absolutely know the score. She was racist, either knowingly or unknowingly as if we were both white she'd have never talked down to us like that. Whilst you are North American and will understand these things, you won't catch them out. Likewise, a few years ago I was on a bus from London Bridge. Far from the suburbs. A white girl got on at 2am and said she didn't have any money or whatever can she get on. The driver allowed this without a second thought ""ok love"" or something similar was what he said. I was on the bottom deck and the rest where white. Later when passing through the city a black girl got on the bus and had the same thing. She said her bag was stolen. She was clearly out in an evening outfit with no pockets or handbag. The driver said to her sorry we just cant let people ride the bus for free I'm just doing my job. She could speak for herself. I let her speak for herself. She was polite and lovely. When the appropriate time came I reminded the driver that he had let a white on the bus with no fare just 10 mins ago. Of course all the whites on the lower deck stood up at the bus driver. He ALrEadY lEt OnE on. He Is JuSt dOiNg HiS JoB. They are programmed to validate racism and manipulate things. In the end I had to pay with my own bank card (we pay by contactless) so she can get home, which could have been a 2h walk in heels otherwise. 

Here you are crucified if you challenge the narrative. As the UK colonised India tHe JEweL oF tHe CrOwn, there is a very different dynamic over racism for Indian people than other ethnicity, so I can't give you more specific advice beyond second hand knowledge. For example if you and a black person went to a rural Wales, no one will bat an eye at you being there even if it is a 100% white village, as there is the understanding that you was part of the empire (it's a narrative here), but they may stare at him and make comments. 

Trust me English people get salty about talking about these things and will destroy you and shun you for discussing your lived experience. 

Whilst I have man privilege, I cannot advise you on issues for a woman traveller in the UK, but I think you will mostly be OK, except in really deprived areas where catcalling is big. 

If you have any questions about places to visit, let me know.

Indeed in some small villages in Cornwall you will only hear Cornish, same in Wales, you will only hear Welsh. And in Ireland (Irish, and sometimes even Ulster Scots). You also only hear Scottish languages in some villages in the North and West of Scotland, such as Scotts and Scotts Gaelic.

You probably never left Birmingham, except to see your cousin in Lester and a lad's trip to London. As a tourist who seems intelligent, she may like to see these fascinating parts of the UK. I gave her information which she can explore to make a nice itinerary matching on her needs. This somehow triggered you to attack me and undermine what I said on a completely stupid basis. Someone not as shallow as you might find it fascinating how the culture of the country varies by region and want to explore topics such as politics, history, geography, language, regionalism, identity, religion, and anthropology. You, on the other hand, just want to consume an episode of Hollyokes. 

Me, overreact. Look at you. This is my exact point about it being English culture to crucify someone over the slightest comment challenging their narrative. You are the very example of this. Your comment was a weaponised one, not a discussion one. ""Oh I think that Cornish is actually spoken by very few people blah blah"". No you attacked me and tried to legitimize me.

The native language of Cornwall *is* Cornish. Underhanded tricks from England changed the language to English. Some parts of the UK people were killed for speaking the language. Now they are being revived.

1. Make a list of things you always wanted to see as a kid and said, ""One day I will see this in person..""  There is pleasure in realizing the dream you had at 6 years old.

2. Think about your interests and plan to enjoy at least one in New York. Whatever your hobbies are, doing one in NYC will highlight the differences between living where you live and living in NYC.  Additionally, you will interact with people who have the same interests as you.

3. Take the Q train to Coney Island. It will give you some idea of the differences between Manhattan and the rest of the city. That train will allow you a birds eye view of the neighborhoods. You will understand what it means to move lots of people every day.  And lets be real, if you navigate the new york city subway, you have earned a notch on your, ""I'm a traveler, not a tourist"" belt. The ride is a straight shot and after being in the density of downtown you will understand why families came to Coney Island to get away for a day.  Walk around for 30 minutes, have a Nathan's and go back downtown.

4. Dont drive unless you are supremely confident in agressive traffic.   New york is meant to be walked. In that same light, get out of ""tourist"" NYC and enjoy the neighnorhoods, There are amazing food courts in Astoria, great architecture in Brooklyn and wonderful public spaces all over the place.

5. One caveat, please dont say to anyone what you said in your post. ""I'm up for anything wierd at least once"".   I'm pretty sure you dont understand that statement like a New Yorker might.

I have always been dreaming about travelling the world, even more so since a cousin of mine has done it aswell; travelled for \~2-3 years. However, I was some what afraid of going out on my own. As I have grown as a person over the years, also due to work, this worries me quite a lot less. The moment I decided I wanted to do this, Covid hit and I couldn’t really continue with my plans. As of the 27th of July I no longer have a job – I quit it myself with the intention of travelling starting after the summer. I have no real (solo) travel experience, though. But I am relatively social, I can also be well on my own and I am a fairly large dude (Dutch and a weightlifter, ha).   
  
**Initial plan**  
Initially my idea was to start by going to South East Asia, starting in Bangkok. Afterwards, travel through pretty much all the countries in the area one-by-one. Since I don’t have a set schedule, I am able to take my time. Afterwards, I wanted to travel to Australia and New Zealand to travel through those countries on a working holiday visa. To finish my travels up – assuming I still love it at this point – I wanted to go South and Central America.   
  
**New plan**  
However, due to Covid and the fact that both South East Asia and Australia/New Zealand are pretty much closed for tourism, I have to alter my plans. I have been told – and I am unsure how much truth there is to it – that South and Central America are “harder” to travel through for backpackers. Hence my doubt as to whether this should be my first real solo trip. Instead, I am also considering travelling for a month or two through eastern Europe, as to gain some experience, before heading to South and Central America. And travelling through South East Asia and Australia/New Zealand at a later point in time, when they have properly opened up.  
  
**Questions**  
For people who have travelled through these area’s, or potentially even live there, is there any truth to Southern and Central America being harder to travel through for backpackers? Potentially with Covid making it even harder (criminality on the rise or something). Don’t get me wrong – I am not at all scared of anything. But that could also be me being ignorant. What scares me is that if I do decide to make Southern and Central America my first solo trip, in Corona times, IF I am having a hard time due to lack of experience, maybe I will lose the motivation to keep travelling. On top of that, for people who have had similar plans (jumping in the deep end, not planning too much and travelling slowly through all kinds of countries and areas) and managed to complete them, would you have any specific advice for me?",1631624988,hctdfwe,t3_pn361v,/r/solotravel/comments/pn361v/rsolotravel_the_weekly_common_room_general/hctdfwe/,1,solotravel

Near Porto: Braga and Guimarães are oft-mentioned. Personally I stopped in Coimbra overnight between Porto and Lisbon and would highly recommend a stop there, at least to see the stunning architecture of the University and Baroque Library. Charming town with beautiful sights, too.

Near Madrid: Toledo is an hour outside Madrid and is a fascinating place to visit if you love architecture, history, views and culture.

For the overnight trains we (I’m traveling with a friend) shared a roomette, so we got access to the dining car, the shower, and having a proper bed overnight. Be warned though, the upper bed is very tight. 

In total highly recommended! Very relaxing (compared to trains in Europe, to which I’m used to as I’m from Germany), and the scenery is absolutely magical. Especially on the California Zephyr you will be glued to the window for most of the ride between Denver and Emeryville.

SXFlyer,t2_42rz0le2,"Thank you! 

1. The trip from NY to LA was 2.5 weeks in total (from August 26th until tomorrow, September 13th). I know, not much time in each city, and I would have preferred staying longer. For example I only had 2 nights in Chicago, but I loved that city, so next time I would plan with at least 4 nights. 

2. Tbh I didn’t really have a budget. Just trying to not spend too much money each day, and if I know that there is a cheaper option, then I did that. Used almost exclusively public transport in each city (used Uber basically only in LA, because public transport is shit and creepy here, but even here I still use public transport most of the time). 

Chicago - Emeryville was $1050 for 2 people in a roomette. I know, a lot of money, but I would say worth it. It includes 6 meals in total, and as I said, the food on the California Zephyr is amazing. Like they offer steak for dinner for example.

The price varies a lot depending on how busy the train is. So April/May should be cheaper, especially if booked long in advance. We booked it only 2 months prior to the trip, and August/September is still the end of the main season. 

In regards of hostels I tried to find the cheapest on hostelworld with a good rating. All of them were good except the one in Chicago. Here in LA we found a cheap Airbnb. 

So in total I guess I spent like 3,000 to 4,000 Euros so far in those 2,5 weeks, including the transatlantic flights.

3. Ever been to New York and/or DC? If no, then I would say yes it’s worth it. Both very nice cities. I personally would skip Philadelphia next time though, didn’t really like it (except the yummy Philly Cheesesteak!). 

I just also read thru your main post again, and I was also thinking about doing Interrail at some point. But I realized that in Western Europe, you still need to add the reservation fees for the high speed trains, and in Eastern Europe the oneway fares are cheaper than Interrail. And as I live in Berlin, which offers a lot of cheap flights across all of Europe, I can do many small trips within Europe. As well as good train connections to Amsterdam, Switzerland, Krakow, and so on. So whenever I have multiple weeks off work, I try to fly somewhere far (like the US). 

Also, I really enjoyed what you have said: just relaxing on the train and disconnect. The trains don’t have wifi, and often no phone service at all. It’s just you and the beautiful scenery around you, going maybe 100 km/h, sometimes a bit more, often way slower. So relaxing. You will meet interesting people in the Observation car. Or in the dining car. It’s truly an unique experience.",1631515942,hcnwn6g,t1_hcnv0jj,/r/solotravel/comments/pm8u8r/going_solo_via_train_rail_pass_crosscountry_usa/hcnwn6g/,2,solotravel

Thankfully I didn’t because we ended up not being as compatible as we had thought and broke up about a year later. I am so glad I didn’t because I’m unlikely to be able to travel to that region again (it was almost 20 years ago). 

In the context of your whole life, 3 months is just not a long time to be away from a new partner, but it certainly can feel that way. It’s something OP needs to keep in perspective before making a decision one way or another, especially if they are young and have this opportunity now.

Now they are building a tunnel for €3.1b which shaves of 30 minutes and all I am thinking about, is that i would deliberately book the slower route as it is just so much nicer.

delpigeon,t2_qc7aedw,"So I've not travelled the US on the train. However I have done a decent length interrail trip. What I would say is that I actually slightly resented the amount of time travelling, it was very tedious sitting for hours and hours waiting for/travelling on trains and ferries, especially overnight trips which I generally tried to avoid but couldn't totally eliminate. You start to feel stuffy and under-exercised. It might be a personality thing. I generally really enjoy train journies and staring out the window, but once I'm up to about 2 hours a day then I'm done.

One thing about the interrail pass is that because they're for time periods you feel a pressure to keep moving on to make as much use of the pass within the time as possible. I don't know how it works with the Rail Pass in the US but if you want to take things really slowly it might be easier to just buy individual tickets than get the pass in terms of value for money, assuming it operates on the same '21 day' or '28 day' or whatever system. Equally if you wanted to do a slower european trip I actually don't know if the interrail ticket is worth it - partly because of the pressure it puts on you but also because depending on the bit of europe you're in, you end up paying loads of surcharge fees anyway - looking at you, Italy and Greece...",1631455455,hckb2lt,t3_pm8u8r,/r/solotravel/comments/pm8u8r/going_solo_via_train_rail_pass_crosscountry_usa/hckb2lt/,1,solotravel

Or I bite the bullet and buy bulkier things in the airport at a slight mark-up, knowing they have to let you then take it on the plane. If you wanted to buy a lot and are going to a 'cheap'ish country, it might even be better value to just buy a second bag when you're out there and pay an extra baggage fee to bring things back, rather than paying to take an empty one on the way out.

The other thing is that you'll use up some of what you're taking out - shampoo, toiletries etc. - and that can take down the weight of your bag to allow for some return items as well.",1631455783,hckbrcx,t3_pmj3rb,/r/solotravel/comments/pmj3rb/anyone_else_ever_decide_to_bring_a_bigger_lugagge/hckbrcx/,1,solotravel

Then the solo travel life became old, sometimes wishing there was someone with me to share in these experiences.   
I had a three country, three month trip booked about a month out, solo.  - Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco - then I met ""Jane""   
Went on trip.   
5 days in cruising down the Nile - could not stop wishing Jane was with me.  
Those places ain't going anywhere.  
The next day I flew back to hang with her instead.

About 10 years ago, I was in a similar situation. A friend and I had planned to spend the summer in Europe. We had planned and paid for everything. 3 days into the trip, he decided he missed his gf too much and cut the trip short, leaving me in Europe by myself. The worst part was, since we had already paid for everything, he and his mom kept hounding me afterwards to pay him back for the portion of the trip that he didn’t take. That ruined the friendship and I haven’t talked to him since. But I heard he and his gf broke up shortly after.

Second, I was in a similar situation, where I had to work for a full year when I had just met someone.  I took it day by day, and had low expectations-as in she will probably lose interest and find someone else.  I focused on my life abroad, met up every 3-4 months, and before I knew it I was gone for more than half way through my time away and she was still there.  I just took it day by day, and two years after I came back we were married. 

My advice would be to have low expectations and take it day by day.  If it doesn’t work out you’ll get over it relatively quickly, but if you come home early and it doesn’t work out you will regret it forever.  Youth is fleeting-enjoy your time with minimal responsibilities.

Is there an option for friends on tinder? I haven't been on the app for years... If not, I suggest making it very clear what you're looking for and only meeting in public places. I mostly met fellow travellers at hostels / short tours so can't help if you want to meet locals.

TardisBlueHarvest,t2_36dryv7h,"There has to be an official site that tells you what you need or contact the airline, don't take what you see here as gospel.  Also, when are you traveling? Things can change between then and now, also ferry schedules changes depending on the season (usually around October).  

Around Athens, especially the touristy heart of Athens, just walk. Things are pretty close, the weather is typically great (even in late November), and it's just a great walking city. Not sure about cards/apple pay, I usually carry some Euros because the smaller (usually better) Souvlaki places seem to be cash only, and that's basically what I eat when I'm in Athens. I would expect bigger places or restaurant in the tourist areas will all take cards. If things are further away, like the ferry port (or bus/train stations) just take the subway.   There's a bus from the airport to Syntagma Square (X95), that's what I'd recommend.

I'm not sure any of us can tell you what's enough time in each place, that's going to depend on you, the amount of time you have and the travel schedule. I've been to Athens twice in the past 6 years and it's one of my favorite cities to spend a few days in. You could spend a couple days visiting the ruins,  take a day to visit Delphi or go up to Meteora (which might be to far for a day trip), or I've spent a day walking all over the city  to see graffiti  &amp; street art.  So figure out what interests you and prioritize.  If you're going to take ferries to the islands you need to plan accordingly give yourself enough time to make sure you're back for your  plane home. I've only been to Crete, partly because the ferries to other places didn't work with my schedule (it was the off season), so I took the night ferries to and from Athens saving me from paying for a hostel or hotel for the night and it made sure I was back in Athens almost 24 hours before my flight left (probably doesn't have to be that big a gap but I was never concerned about time).  

TLDR Check w/Airlines or Greek government sites for COVID requirements, should be able to use cards at touristy/big places but small local places it might be an issue, how much time you want in each place depends on what you want to see/do,  ferries are probably the best/cheapest way to get around but check the schedules.  Airport express bus, the subway, &amp; walking are the best way to get around Athens.",1631362844,hcfe9yf,t3_pm1idu,/r/solotravel/comments/pm1idu/solo_trip_to_athens_santorini_and_mykonos/hcfe9yf/,1,solotravel

You'll need a passenger locator form or PLF, they want to know where you live and where you have been in the prior 14 days. You can find it directly in the gov website: [https://travel.gov.gr/#/](https://travel.gov.gr/#/)

2)Bring some cash. I've been in Mykonos last week and the owner of B&amp;B where I was staying asked me to be payed in cash. I have to say that the island is full of ATM

3-4-6)Cabs in Athens are a waste of money, Athens has one of the best public transport system in Europe. A very good metro and lots of buses. It will cost you 8 euros fron airport to center, I took the X95. Then you can do a 5 days ticket which costs only 5 euros and it allows you to travel on metros and all buses. I haven't been to Santorini but in Mykonos buses are good. The island is full of taxis too and they're not too expensive, they're useful if you want to stay out in the night until late. In Mykonos to get from the hotel to the airport I used Welcome Pickups, you can buy a pick up on their website or app and it's reliable. To travel from Athens to islands ferry is good.

5)3 days in Athens are not nearly enough. I stayed 5 days and I haven't been able to see everything. Little museums will take you 2 hours, in big museum you can even spend haf day and you can't do too many museums in a day or you will destroy your feet. I limped before the 4th day. Besides it's a lively city, you're going to wish to live it outside the museums too, going around in the streets, try their restaurants ecc.   
I haven't been in Santorini but from I've heard 4 days are more than enough. 3 days for Mykonos are enough, it takes 2-3 hours to visit every corner of the town and then there is not much else to do than go drinking and dancing in the evening.

Vaccination is enough to travel between islands and also ferry is the better option. If you are a student i would recommend you getting an ISIC card, this thing has saved me tons of money, many ferry lines will gjve you half price if you have an ISIC card.

Idk about Athenes and/or taxis in general as i just walk or take the public transport.

Yes its better to rent a moped / quad, way more nicer then a car although if you hate dust then go for a car, prices range between 20-40 euro for a moped/quad and 30-50 for a car (or atleast what i have been quoted).

Its better to go from Athens to Mykonos and from Mykonos to Santorini, but if you cannot change your itinerary i'd say take all ferries or take one flight to Santorini from Athens and then ferry from Santorini to Mykonos.

I was 1 day 1 night in Mykonos and i loved it so much (party scene is wild here) that when i left i came back after 2 days :) so yeah 3 days 4 days is good, just know that Mykonos and Santorini are very fricking expensive, but seriously doable.

LaughingZombie41258,t2_7rxjxt0j,"It seems you have it pretty figured out. 

I have to say only that 1 day is not enough for Venice, 2-3 days are more comfortable. There are interesting museums and you have to go by feet. Like others say, Murano and Burano islands are totally worth. 

For Rome Tivoli is a must see, a day trip is enough tho. Goo see San Pietro and San Giovanni, they're also free. Vatican museum isn't free (it cost 16 euros) but it's worth it. 

If you visit Turin, make sure to pay a visit to the Egyptian museum, it's the second largest in the world.

An advice: beware the tourist traps. Especially in Rome, Venice and Florence. Fancy bars and restaurants on the historical squares will go out of their way to scam you. Prices are very high and it can happen they can make the tourists pay more than the locals. Avoid them, go to the less fancy places and anyway always ask  for the menu before buying something. Check on Trip Advisors. In Italy we have excellent food anywhere, no need to spend hundreds of euros. For example if someone asks you 10 euros for an ice-cream go elsewhere.

Also don't take taxis in Rome. The public transportation is available at every hour, day and night, and taxis charge unreasonable prices. Some years ago there was an economic bubble about the taxi licenses and actual taxi drivers paid like 100000 euros for their license, so now they're making their problem everyone's problem charging high to repay their debts.",1631372523,hcfwq32,t3_pln7rp,/r/solotravel/comments/pln7rp/upcoming_1st_solo_trip_going_to_mostly_italy/hcfwq32/,2,solotravel

NotLaFontaine,t2_7skm3,"I’d recommend buying an open jaw ticket, which allows you to fly into one city and return from another — arriving in Lisbon and returning from Barcelona, for example.

As far as an itinerary, if I were you, I’d start in Portugal and it would go something like this:

**Portugal**

-	Start in Lisbon or the Algarve
-	Move north toward Porto, while checking out some other towns or villages along the way.
-	Optional: side trip to the Azores, if Ryan Air still has cheap flights. The nature is outstanding!
-	From Porto, head to Santiago de Compostela

**Spain**

-	From Santiago de Compostela, head east across the north of Spain. Consider a stop in Orvieto to have some cider and spend a day in Picos de Europa national park. It’s almost like a miniature version of the Swiss Alps. 
-	Work your way toward Bilbao and the Basque Country. Bilbao is a great city! You can also access San Sebastián and Guernica.
-	From N. Spain, cut a path south toward Madrid (stopping somewhere along the way, maybe Burgos or Pamplona). 
-	From Madrid, set aside time to visit Toledo and Segovia (you’ll need a day for each).
-	Leaving Madrid, head south toward Andalusia. Make sure you visit Seville, Córdoba and  Al Hambra in Grenada.
-	Enjoy any other parts of the south and take a few days for the beach, if you like.
-	Move up the Mediterranean Coast of Spain, giving  Valencia a couple of days before ending in Barcelona.",1631373002,hcfxtv9,t3_pm7sny,/r/solotravel/comments/pm7sny/first_solotrip_spain_and_portugal_questions/hcfxtv9/,6,solotravel

notthegoatseguy,t2_sc6od09,"So you can't really think of the long haul Amtrak routes as transportation.

I mean they are transportation of sorts. But it isn't the quickest. And when you add the costs of rooms or roomettes, it is much more expensive than flying or even driving.

You have to think of these long haul train trips as part of the journey themselves. It provides you the ability to see some fantastic scenery from the train, though unfortunately due to night/day, sometimes that scenery isn't going to be available when it is dark. These routes are probably best enjoyed at the peak of summer when our days are longest, but also it'll be more crowded and more expensive.

Also keep in mind many of these stations may only have one train come through a day, or every other day. And if you miss that train, then you're stuck with another day.

Finally, the delays on Amtrak, particularly outside of New England, the Northeast, and Mid Atlantic regions are very, very real. For example, the Amtrak connection between Indianapolis and Chicago, a 3 hour drive, often takes over 5 hours due to freight traffic having priority. This can make it challenging if you are transitioning from Amtrak to a state run corridor or bus service, or trying to be in a specific city on a specific day.

Living in Indiana, Chicago is nearby and is basically the rail hub for the nation as it heads west. I'm planning to do one of these long haul routes at some point, but I'm probably not going to hop off/on....maybe might do it once for Glacier National Park as it has a pretty direct train stop there.

Similar to the rail passes in other nations, really crunch the numbers to make sure it is worth financially to you.

Hartaknut,t2_adlili1y,"I did a 4 month Interrail trip across Europe a couple of years ago. 31 days, 13 cities, and the most amazing experience in my life. But god that was tiring. I personally prefer Europe compared to the US (and yes I am European haha), so that’s what I would recommend. 

My tips to make it less stressful and tiring would be:
- Spend at least 3 nights in each location
- Know that some countries have quite a shitty rail service, especially in Eastern Europe (think trains cancelled last minute, platform that can’t be found, zero info in English...). But it all went well in the end, and it was a lot of fun, just know it.
- Book yourself some decent hotels if your budget allows it, it makes a huge difference on how rested you will feel.

Finally, my favourite destinations were:
-Ljubljana (Slovenia): SO CUTE and pretty! (I recommend 2-3 days)
- Budapest (Hungary): incredible city (I recommend 4-5 days)
- Porto (Portugal): beautiful and charming but avoid if you don’t feel like climbing the equivalent of 60 floors a day (I recommend 3-4 days)
- Prague (Czech Republic): incredibly pretty (I recommend 4-5 days).

Creative_Drama_70,t2_7iuq6tia,"Five years ago, I took the Capitol Limited from Washington DC to Elkhart IN (RV Capital of the world - was pricing rigs) where I laid over a few days before getting back on the Capitol Ltd to Chicago - where I transferred to the Empire Builder, which I took all the way to Portland.  I booked a roomette on both long legs, and traveled coach between Elkhart and Chicago.   


The travel is not high-speed at all, but if you're not in a hurry, I found it to be relaxing and enjoyable. The view out the window was lovely - especially from the observation car with glass above too. If you book a roomette (considered first class) your meals are included. I'm not sure how they are doing things in a Covid atmosphere, but I found dining with strangers to be rather nice -as I enjoy hearing other folks' travel stories. (They seat four to a booth under normal circumstances - traveling together or not). The other perks of traveling 1st class include free refreshments (coffee, water, etc.)  and a room attendant who can bring you those items, help you with your bags, and give you turn down service if wanted (convert your roomette chairs to a bed) while you're at dinner.   


The only stressor I found in traveling by Amtrak, was that in the smaller towns (like Elkhart), the train station is in the middle of nowhere, or in the middle of the industrial part of town - which isn't always the most safest feeling. You can research the stations and determine if those you choose are full-service or just shelters. Fortunately, I found a rental car company that provided pick up service at the station in Elkhart. In Portland, I didn't have any problems getting around. Choices included taxi, uber, and the public transit system.   


Before you book a trip, do some research as to the views depending on what direction you're going in. Going east to west, I witnessed a glorious sunset over Glacier National Park while having dinner.   


Another negative... I've heard Amtrak isn't the most dependable when it comes to being on time. So, if you're trying to book excursions, or hop on and off along the way, keep that in mind.

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"For “food you don’t have back home” in Houston, I’d especially recommend seafood as it’s not going to be the same type as what you encounter down south and will be far better than someplace like Red Lobster (which for good reason doesn’t have outposts in the area).

Lobster: boiled, baked stuffed, or lobster rolls. This last has two versions, one cold, a lobster salad with mayo and maybe a little celery, while the other is hot, just lobster chunks dripping with butter — both wonderful. Usually not that cheap, but so worth it.

Steamed clams: a great way to start off before a lobster meal. These will be in the shell. Pull out the clam, skin off the dark membrane over the neck, dunk first in clam broth and second in drawn butter, then eat. Repeat.

Fried seafood, especially clams (don’t settle for clam strips): usually had on a plate with fries and cole slaw. Scallops, shrimp, fish (usually haddock) are also common choices, with oysters sometimes also seen. A fisherman’s platter combines all these options in one dish. A clam roll is fried clams in a hot dog bun, also good (other fried seafood can be found also).

New England clam chowder: actually available in many parts of the US nowadays, but it originated in New England. A cream based soup.

Indian pudding: nice when you can find it, it’s cornmeal based and flavored with molasses. Get it hot with vanilla ice cream on top.

In Maine, where they grow blueberries, a breakfast of blueberry pancakes can be really good, often made with fresh berries. Get real maple syrup if you can — you often have to pay a little extra for it, but it’s far better than the generic fake stuff sitting on the table.

Vermont and New Hampshire may have cider donuts available. They’re nice when you can find them. Avoid Dunkin’ Donuts, though, as the donuts are terrible and the coffee is weak. You can do far better at a local mom and pop donut and coffee place.

If you run across red flannel hash at a breakfast spot, it’s well worth getting and not often found outside northern New England. Get it with a pair of eggs on top.",1631376595,hcg62i4,t3_plzd9b,/r/solotravel/comments/plzd9b/maine_new_hampshire_vermont/hcg62i4/,3,solotravel

Dinger-7,t2_6xxl52j1,"To answer your questions: 

1. I did a 2 month trip, 11 countries.  I didn't use Eurail, maybe it's feasible in some cases but I found pretty cheap transport using independent flights/trains/busses.  

2. Being fully vaccinated is most of what you need but COVID rules are always changing.  Just do your research.  

3. Local travel is no problem in Germany/Austria.  The train network is incredible.

I have a few other thoughts that you may or may not find helpful. 

A. As others have mentioned, that is a lot for only a month with some long distances to cover.  If you cut out only the Barcelona and Cairo stops it becomes much more manageable in time spent travelling.  Although if you find cheap flights to/from Barcelona for example, it could still be very feasible.  

B. Personally I found about 3 days for each place is a pretty good rule of thumb.  Of course some places could use more (4 or 5) and others you can see what you want in only a day or 2.  But I find that's a nice balance of seeing lots of different places in a limited time without being constantly on the move.  A little relax time is important.  You can get burnt out, especially later in the trip.  I just didn't have the same enthusiasm to go sightseeing after a few weeks.  

C. Germany/Austria/Hungary is a great core for your trip.  Can't comment on Greece, I've never been.  But if your going all the way down there I would consider some of the places on the way.  Croatia is beautiful.  And probably pretty cheap in April (gets really touristy in the Summer though).  There's not always trains in the Balkans though.  Also, if you are going to Vienna anyway I definitely recommend at least a day trip if not a stop in Bratislava.  

D. **Hostels!**  If you're a social person, hostels are a solo-traveler's best friend.  Coming from North America, I had no idea how easy it was to make friends or how much fun I would have travelling in hostels.  If you don't mind sleeping around others, great adventures can be had and amazing memories can be made.  Don't be afraid to just introduce yourself to other travelers.  Also, if using something like Hostelworld, pay attention to the atmosphere rating.  The best hostels I ever stayed at all had excellent ""atmosphere"" ratings.  

E. Eastern Europe.  I think most North Americans are mostly unaware of the how great Eastern Europe is.  And very cost effective.  A budget can go a long way in some of these places.  I really enjoyed visiting Hungary, Croatia, Czech Rep, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia.  The Baltic states in particular really are a hidden gem (Vilnius is an unknown great city IMO).  

F. Check the little flights.  If you aren't rigid in your schedule, sometimes you can find really cheap flights around Europe.  I found some cheap flights early in my planning stages and let them shape my travel plans a little bit.  

G. Your budget seems reasonable to me.  Of course it depends a lot on where you go, what you do, and how you eat.  I spent some time at friend's places and in Eastern Europe but I spent less than that on my 2 month trip.  

Well this ended up getting kinda long, but hopefully things I've learned can help you or someone else enjoy themselves a little bit more.  Cheers!",1631263678,hcag791,t3_pl0gii,/r/solotravel/comments/pl0gii/modes_of_travel_within_europe/hcag791/,1,solotravel
Pandustin,t2_uoryj,"&gt;I really want to go to a place that is not too mainstream and where English is well understood.

Please think about this sentence for some minutes.... You want to go somewhere that is not mainstream so not touristy but expect people there to speak good english. As other stated in Austria you wont have much of a problem, but this just doesn't make sense!

But to also contribute in your post.Let me know if you have any questions about munich, If I'll have some freetime in April you could also hit me up and I could show you stuff.Switzerland really is beyond expensive, especially Zurich. I've just been there 4 days ago and was shocked even though I live in an expensive city already.Consider that Eurorail or trains in general will eat a lot of your time.Also what might be relevant is that german trains fucking sucks, the tiny (felt like) 200 years old train in thailand I took mulitple times is more punctual than any ICE i've ever taken.

Depending how you enter countries there might not even be any controls, and if, vaccination pass should be alright (at least based on todays research as a german citizen)

I was there for four days a few years ago and spent less including two upscale meals.

Suggest you spend at least one of the days or two half-days on day trips outside the city - to Louisiana (great modern art museum located on a shore with cool views), Malmo (30 minutes by train - it's a cute city and you get to get a small cultural slice of Sweden as a bonus to Denmark, plus that bridge is cool), or Helsingor (""Hamlet's castle""). 

I don't know about Kulturnatten performances, but outside of that, everyone speaks perfect English. I'm also from New York and ended up making some local friends (at the really cute ""Kind of Blue"" wine bar) who were psyched to meet a New Yorker.

Another thing to do is to climb the steeple at Vor Frelsers Kirke. I have a fear of falling, and it was one the scariest and coolest things I've ever done.

One of my favorite memories traveling.  I was in Nepal doing the longer route to everest base camp.  I was in Thame, a little village north west of namche bazar.  I was just hiking around town and started heading up a trail.  It was misty and kinda spooky.  Finally I reach a little town on the skirts of the mountain.  It was completely empty.  Not a soul to be seen.  And in that town there was a monastery.  I got to the doors but they were half closed.  I let myself in.  I was alone in the monastery.  Eventually a single young monk showed up.  Very friendly guy.  He showed me around.  Private tour.  Including the sacred prayer area.  He wouldn’t allow me taking pictures.  Spent a couple hours with him.  And headed back to my tea house.

Not speaking from personal experience but I have heard from others about it. 

As for the day trips, check them out on the internet to get a feel. Not all may be your cuppa tea. Nyc is a great walking city. Walk around and explore.

Despite being a New Yorker, I have experienced them both lol. 

Plenty of inexpensive places to eat. If you want to cook then buy groceries from Trader Joe’s in the city. Bring your own bag cuz groceries in NY will charge you for the bag. 

Use your Reddit community if you need questions answered. Most importantly, enjoy the city and it’s surroundings. Wear a mask to be on the safer side.

There are lots and lots of Buddhist monasteries here in the Himalayan states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himanchal Pradesh. Laddakh and Lahaul-Spiti are two regions of the country that are remote, situated in high Himalayas and have serene monasteries. 

You would enjoy holy environment, calm surrounding and adventurous local areas as well. These places are also famous for adventure sports and routes to these areas passes through some of the highest mountain passes of the world. Afterall it's the Himalayas, tallest mountains in the world.

Some popular monasteries in Laddakh region-

* Diskit monastery
* Thiksey monastery- at altitude of 3600 m ASL and established in 15th century.
* Hemis monastery- established in 11th century

In Lahaul Spiti region-

* Key monastery-  4166 m ASL, estb. in 11th century
* Tabo- founded in 966 AD. Along with monastery, there are several caves that were used by monks for meditation.

Other than these, there are numerous others. Also these areas are cheap and have abundant home stays that are relatively less pricey. But some of these places are touristy particularly the Laddakh region.

WesJersey,t2_5kuex8d1,"I did a guided  trip to the Amazon and Sacred Valley/Machu Picchu with Overseas Adventure Travel 2 years ago and highly recommend them. Our guide happened to be a former university professor and a supervisor in their 35+ person local office. We got a brief talk at every archeology site, putting what we were looking at into the context of what we had already seen,  We had numerous introductions or interactions with local folks, strolling the markets, visiting a chica bar (off hours), an Inca home with gunea pigs on the floor and ancestors skulls in the wall, chatting with farmers and mud brick makers, in  addition to the shamans and local pottery and weaving studios and home hosted dinners also offered by other tour companies. In addition to all the usual archeology sites. 

My first and only such tour, so my only comparison is through observing and chatting with fellow travelers with other companies. OAT seems to do Peru very well. Don't be surprised to run into other OAT tour groups in your hotels, they do a lot of business there.  

As for the trip, Lima is nice but has perpetual clouds and drizzle, no need to schedule more than the day or two passing through. Miaflores is worth the drive from the airport.  Don't miss Lovers Park.

 Don't  stay in Cuzco next if you get altitude sickness or have never been at altitude. You pretty much have to fly in to Cuzco, but better to descend the same day to lower elevation in the Sacred Valley for a few days,  see Machu Picchu, then go back up to Cuzco. (I ran into a group on a fairly typical itinerary of Lima to Lake Titicaca(13k) then Cuzco and many of them got  sick, big surprise.)

You don't necessarily need a guided tour of course, the tourist industry is well developed and regulated. Licensed Guides are available or required at most archeology sites.

Not sure I understand question 3, given that you’re already planning on taking trains - do that. There are ferries from Athens to Santorini.

What small towns are not tourist packed in Austria? I really want to go to a place that is not too mainstream and where English is well understood.

You could almost get off the train at any small town in Austria and have a good time, but for example try St. Wolfgang or Mondsee. For slightly larger towns, check out Zell am See, Gmunden, or Bad Ischl. All of these are popular tourist destinations, mind, but not *quite* as packed.

BitchLibrarian,t2_101pot,"Look into Monastery stays for visiting Rome. About ten years ago I went with my Dad and we booked a monastery stay. They're basically offering accommodation for pilgrims in the spirit of hospitality which goes back to the middle ages. However, they are available to everyone- true hospitality.  We stayed in a building attached to a convent about 7 minutes walk from St Peters. The rooms were basic but perfectly well equipped, especially compared with city centre hotels. En suite, clean abs with comfy beds. We got a classic Italian style continental breakfast included (coffee, pastries, ham and cheese and fruit) and the only unconventional part was an 11pm curfew. Since I was travelling with my dad and doing lots of (exhausting) daytime sightseeing that was not an issue. We never saw the nuns but there was an open invitation to attend any of their services.

When we went to Pompeii we stayed in a town called Torre del Greco between Pompeii and Herculaneum and visited both. Prices were cheaper, there was a small beach there and it was easy to visit Naples etc using public transport. It took us a while to work out that the mini buses we saw zipping around the town were request to stop buses. You just stood by the side of the road and flagged them down and paid a very low fare to go to wherever on their route was near where you wanted to be. If that one was full another would come around soon enough.

We lucked out big time with the basic backpackers Hotel we booked in Sorrento.  It shared beach access with a fancy hotel. So as well as basic, clean and secure accommodation we got a lift down to a fantastic cove for swimming in all at a budget price and easy walk into town. So check out hotels too. And hotel staff are great sources of local info.

A big tip for travelling in Italy is that any local shop which has a deli counter and sells loose fresh bread (pretty much all local food shops in Italy) will happily make up a sandwich for you if you ask. So you can have your choice of meats, cheese, any of the sauces/spreads they sell like pesto, any of the preserved or cooked veggies and probably a tomato sliced in all made up into a fresh sandwich for the cost of the ingredients. No battered sandwich you made that morning which has been squashed by your water bottle and got a bit warm and none of the slightly suspicious looking cling wrapped sandwiches that are overpriced and look like they haven't been refrigerated from the kiosks on the tourist route. Just find a small local store and have a chat with the staff. Italians are generally gregarious and chatty and interested. They'll good-naturedly laugh if you pronounce words wrong but enjoy that you tried and get everyone within hearing involved in a discussion about whatever you asked them. They'll help you on the public transport or in the street. And definitely in the shops. The tourist trap places will jade you, head to where the locals go and slow down and make contact. It will be worth it.

My only advice as a solo woman in Italy is the same as anywhere. Be aware of your surroundings. Don't travel flashy, keep valuables put of sight or leave them at home and try not to get drunk drunk. Talk to the people like receptionists so they know you're coming back at whatever time and if you get that dodgy feeling leave. You'll have a gadget, use it. Take pics and send to a safety friend back home (this guy is being weird, here's his pic and I'm heading to x place right now or getting on bus number xx or I'll be in my room by this time or here's the plate details of the taxi I'm getting in). We live in a digital age. You can send this info around the world and your friend can vid call you to check you're safe. Do it, friends and family love you and a 3am call for ten seconds from foreign parts is no biggie to check that someone lovely is safe.",1631088535,hc1aghh,t3_pjwmfy,/r/solotravel/comments/pjwmfy/planning_solo_travel_italy_2022/hc1aghh/,2,solotravel

I live in Cali and love it here so I would certainly recommend it but I think you might have one too many spots on your itinerary already.

Santa Marta is the big beach town in mainland Colombia and a fun little historic city too. Lots of fun and close to Taganga or Tayrona Park for side trips too.

Florence to Rome is only 1.5 hours. I choose train travel over any other form, but I also find it is a great way to plan. I stayed in Florence for 2 months a while back and made easy trips for a day, or a few nights, to Sienna, Milan, Lake Como, La Spezia/Cinque Terra, Bologna. I also did a day trip by local bus to Greve for wine tasting.

Venice is overrun by tourists but it is still a unique city worth a visit. If you stay on the islands the place is almost deserted when the day trippers go home. You would certainly need more money than your Air BnB to do that though. You can eat a great meal for 15 euros as you wander around Rome, or you can spend 25 euros on two coffees on St Mark's Square in Venice.

I would look to mix up the big cities with some smaller towns. Florence and Rome are extraordinary and need four days to a week to explore properly. Milan could be a two night stop and Bologna a day trip or one night stay.

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"Great advice from u/JacobAldridge above.

While I haven’t been to Naples and the Amalfi Coast, I have researched it. Sorrento actually seems like a good centrally-based (and safer) town for exploring Naples, Pompeii/Herculaneum/Vesuvius, Capri, and the towns further along the coast like Positano, Amalfi, and Paestum. You can take the train to Naples and the Vesuvius area, a ferry to Capri, and a bus to the rest.

The suggestion for a week or a little less in Rome and Florence is spot on. Consider a day trip to Tivoli and and a half day at Ostia Antica as part of the former, as well as a day trip to Siena and half day to Pisa from the latter.

I will also recommend Venice if you haven’t been. You can see most all of it in two days, and it’s an utter must.

Honestly, all of the above makes for an ideal three weeks in Italy. Other areas like Milan (2-3 days), Verona (1 day) \[been to both\] and 1-2 days each for Lake Como and Cinque Terre \[have not been to these\] are at least worth considering, at least for the future if not now.",1631107697,hc21ae2,t1_hc0d069,/r/solotravel/comments/pjwmfy/planning_solo_travel_italy_2022/hc21ae2/,2,solotravel

jojo-schmojo,t2_v3e6p,"Hello, I'm an American that lives in Valencia. If you're looking for second-hand shops, boutiques, and hipsters there is no other place than Russafa. It's got all of that in spades. It's also the most international neighborhood in the city. In Russafa you may be interested in Ubik, which is a book store and cafe/bar combined.  If you're looking for more of a local feel, I would recommend from Plaza España up towards Abastos there's some cool bars and cafes that feel more local. (Bar Excursionista is my favorite, I also used to live above it.)

The beach, when I go alone, I usually tuck my stuff underneath the towel and I've never been robbed. I don't see why you couldn't ask a family nearby though, they're friendly people here. Someone would watch your stuff.

Two warnings.

One: If you're worried about being robbed, be very wary in the Turia park (old river gardens), as petty theft has gone WAY up recently in the park and the thieves are a lot more brazen. I know of multiple people who have been robbed in the Turia and a few others who they tried to rob but were unsuccessful.

Two: If you are thinking of going to El Saler beach to swim (which is arguably the best beach near Valencia city), skip it. For some reason there is a jellyfish bloom this summer and when I went we were barely able to be in the water because of so many jellyfish. It's been like that for weeks. Though, L'Albufera is nearby and well worth a visit to see the rice fields and take a boat ride in the estuary, but don't swim in El Saler.

RacerGirl_3,t2_d04qmh85,"I am Italian and I celebrated my 30th bday with a trip to the States so I feel like I need to answer you!

It’s perfectly safe to be there alone and also plenty of things to do by yourself. My hometown is fairly close to Rome so I visited it (also solo) many times, then I lived 5 years fairly close to Venice and also there, went many times alone, you’ll have no problem.

I think with your budget you’ll be okay, avoid tourist traps, especially valid on restaurants, which end up being very expensive and very low quality.

Rome is a must go! I also suggest to add Amalfi or Capri to your Naples stay. I went to Pompei too and it’s also something incredibly unique. I suggest to go also visit the church of the “Madonna di Pompei” which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful in Italy. If you manage to get to Venice, that’s also a must see, even if not a favorite of mine (too touristy). Florence is beautiful but the Tuscan countryside is better :) not so easy to move in Tuscany imo without a car. Bologna and Emilia Romagna have the best vibes in Italy (and my favorite dish ever: tortellini!). If you want to go somewhere not so touristy but closer at the beach I would advise wherever around Marche or Abruzzo - I am from Abruzzo so I am biased - but you might like it (and it’s also close from Rome/Naples).

I would learn some basic Italian, many people knows it nowadays, especially if you stick to tourist cities, but a couple of survival words cannot hurt.

Let me add that April/May it’s a great moment to visit Italy, weather wise and rush of tourism wise.

I fucking loved Egypt and it's one of my favorite trips. The history is absolutely insane. A good guide is definitely helpful for interpreting what you're seeing and for navigating the tourist spots in Arabic. Cairo is an absolute madhouse but really fascinating, and the Pyramids and Egyptian Museum are a must see. Luxor and Aswan are also must dos. We did a cruise down the Nile and I thought it was a fantastic way to see everything.

Like most of the Middle East you'll just get heckled a lot for being a tourist, there are tons of people selling touristy things on the street and they'll straight up follow you for 100 yards yelling in your ear in a combination of every language - switching from English to French to Spanish to German, it's quite impressive TBH! Just ignore them though, unless you're really interested, just keep in mind they mark the prices up a ton so there's always room to negotiate. It's annoying but just part of the cultural experience.

You'll likely get a little sick at some point, everyone I went with did. Don't drink the tap water and avoid street food/anything washed with tap water if you want to be really careful. But some members of our party were super careful, only eating at the nicest restaurants/hotels, and still got sick. In terms of street food, there's a lot of good stuff, hard to differentiate but having a local guide really helped on that front. We had some amazing falafels.",1631116433,hc2lf4d,t3_pi62g2,/r/solotravel/comments/pi62g2/questions_about_travel_in_egypt/hc2lf4d/,1,solotravel

""Posso usare il bagno?"" - can I use the bathroom?

""Dov'è il bagno?"" - were is the bathroom? 

""Come stai oggi?"" - how are you today? 

""Grazie mille"" - thank you so much! People are very helpful here so I say that a lot. Sometimes I add a ""tu sei molto gentile!"" - you are so kind!

I use the Trainline app to get between cities, it's pretty useful.

You could do Venice in a day but it's pretty far from Rome. Anywhere in Northern Italy is super pretty but relatively far from the area you'll be going it sounds like. 

When going to restaurants you'll usually go inside to pay, and if you're not sure you can ask the server. Is usually say ""Pago dentro?"" - do I pay inside?

You just need to set expectations for the day. 1 or 2 things to do per day and let plenty of free time for personal exploration. I’ve discovered places and people i would’ve never met by tagging along with friends when they do want they want.

But if you want to cover as many locations as possible in SLO and nearby, your plan is doable and also leaving you time to enjoy the spots. Most of the destinations will easily be reachable by public transport or Flixbus or something similar.

If you want to try skiing, ice-skating or other outdoor activities, consider time consupmtion for that. 

Anyway, there will be more cheap tickets and you can come again.",1631001979,hbwp98y,t3_pj6vzv,/r/solotravel/comments/pj6vzv/help_with_travel_plan_8_days_between_ljubljana/hbwp98y/,1,solotravel

sulcslo,t2_tg21d,"I am a local. You will be very, very lucky to see the snow in August, even on our highest mountain Triglav.

Most preferred month for hiking is probably September, but you can do many trails in November as well. Probably Vintgar gorge will be closed as they close in colder months - there are wooden bridges that get wet and slippery and therefore the gorge is closed. But you can opt for Pokljuka gorge, which is also near. It is dry (no river), but interesting as well.
Bled with surrounding hills will see no snow in November, mountains around Bohinj might as those mountains are higher.

So, for hiking you will need enough warm clothes, good shoes, bottle of water and a sandwich. Not for mountaineering, winter conditions can occur in November in the mountains.

If you will spend November in Slovenia, you will probably have anough nice weather to see many interesting places outdoors. For casual hikes, northwestern part is probably the nicest (Julian Alps) so you may consider to move your home base a little.",1631004186,hbwrqkd,t1_hbnp6uz,/r/solotravel/comments/phw3ud/three_months_three_countries_in_europe_looking_at/hbwrqkd/,1,solotravel

xRazorLazor,t2_n719l,"While I feel sorry for your experience and agree that solotravelling can be fun, I have to say that the reason why your holidays didn't workout well wasn't that group holidays in general suck, but that your group of friends lacks maturity, communication skills and the ability to compromise..

Just some pointers:

1) Friend 3 should have never come with you in the first place if he didn't have enough money for the full trip experience and he/she should have known that by themselves.

2) Friend 1 should have agreed to come with you guys to the restaurants and then get Subway/McDonalds on the way back or so. Like this all people are happy even if it's not optimal.

3) Friend 2 whose card didn't work, that's actually an issue that can happen and I feel like it was solved in an okayish way. Better would have been to establish boundaries and maybe withdraw money in cash and give it to her directly to not feel guilty for letting her pay little things that actually sum up to bigger numbers.

4) Same friend 2 who was sleeping in a lot - not sure if you communicated that but if not it's also your fault. If you did and she still didn't want to adapt, then maybe she is not a good friend since you helped her out a lot during those vacations.

All in all, I had less bad experiences in group holidays because I avoided to go with people I knew would cause trouble in a vacation setup.

You can google the city if you want. It's well connected. If you drive on the motorway you are 5/6 hours away from Madrid, 2.5h away from Lisbon, Coimbra is about 40 mins and it's lovely too.

We have a bunch of white sandy beaches, including a couple of more secluded areas for nudists if you're into it but dont like too many googly eyes.

We do have a A LOT of northern-europeans during Spring, Summer  and Autumn. Some even own houses here so it's not uncommon to hear german, dutch or some other language while walking around.

Since we are by the Atlantic, it's a bit windy so even when it's super-hot, the salty-breeze cools you down a bit so it's never as bad as some portuguese regions that reach 40°C at times.

I think the best time to visit is September. The days are still long-enough (right now we have daylight up until 20:30h) and most of the tourists/returning expats are already gone. May and April are usually a bit rainy but to be honest the weather has changed a lot so I cant promise good or bad weather. Just last night around midnight it was raining cats and dogs and during the entire day, and even right now, you cant see a cloud up there.

Diver_Driver,t2_mgiiv,"For pilots the first few years are a bit of a grind but not more than any other professional career IMO. Its worth the grind in the beginning given long term pay potential and benefits. 

Cant speak to flight attendant schedules but as a pilot starting out at an airline you generally have 12 days off/month minimum. With some seniority that can be 15-20 (depending on how much you want to work and how much money you want to make). At my airline if I manage my back to back monthly schedules correctly I can get 3-4 weeks in a row off. This gives me the chance to be home a bit as well as go do a long international trip.

How much you are home is somewhat dependent on how much you want to be home and what sort of trips your airline has. As an on call guy in his second year at a major airline I'm sleeping in a hotel an average of only 5 nights/month. Some months more, some less. My airline has a lot of day trips built rather than long multi day trips. 

Starting pay at a regional airline is about $50-60k/yr. I work at a major airline and we have Captains that pull in $700k/yr. First Officers at my major can easily make $200k/yr within a few years.

Flight benefits are great. Being able to hop on an airplane for free to go wherever I want is pretty amazing. I can hop on some cargo carriers and access international destinations which is pretty cool. First class seats, bunks, and meals, all at no charge.

Frehaaan,t2_v0ksekw,"I'm a Texas native, been traveling the country. Gotta say my favorite national park so far has been Sequoia/king's canyon (in the Sierra Nevada mountains) with the biggest trees in the world. The park starts at 1000ft elevation and goes up to 7000. Doing it in 3 days would be very action filled lol but you could do it if you flew.

If you want waterfalls though, a few hours north of sequoia is Yosemite with the largest waterfall in the continental US (and lots of other large waterfalls on sheer cliff faces). I personally liked sequoia better b/c I loved the awe I got from the massive trees but that's just me!

Alternatively, big bend was a shocking, wonderful experience with great hiking and mountains. One trail goes along the Rio Grande in a canyon and it's awesome. And my god the stars were like nothing I've ever seen, not even in more remote places... It's like you're in space. Not sure about weather this time of year.

Nashville has a fun night life with amazing music and you could drive a couple hours out of the city to find mountains and waterfalls as well (like drive to great smokey mountains NP, which has no admission fee). But imo the Appalachians are less impressive than the Sierra Nevadas, and the weather isn't as nice lol. But that's just my opinion! They're still beautiful.

JustDivine,t2_a0sja,"Albania is one of my favourite countries, I spent 2 months exploring and volunteering at a hostel in Berat a few years back and it was amazing.

As for highlights, here's a quick list, happy to answer more questions if you have them:

* Valbonë - Theth hike - this is the best thing to do in Albania imo, not that difficult, easy to organise from any of the main Shkodra hostels (if you dig into my post history a bit I've written a fairly detailed post about it)
* Beaches around Himarë, around Sarandë and all the way in between the two. I heard good things about the ones near Vlorë too, but didn't make it myself
* Cities of Berat (town of a thousand windows), Gjirokaster (town of a thousand steps) and Korcë. Berat is wine country, Gjirokaster is just cool and Korcë had a great beer festival sometime in August.
* The bunkers
* Tirana is a cool city too, feels somewhat different, bunkart I and II are cool museums, obviously being the capital it has lots of the history
* The UNESCO heritage sites

I've probably missed some, but I got to Albania knowing almost nothing and left almost 2 months later than I had planned, finding more things just from talking to the hostel owners/volunteers/locals",1630924951,hbsm5bw,t3_piibk4,/r/solotravel/comments/piibk4/solo_trip_albania_spring_2022_tips_please/hbsm5bw/,2,solotravel

NSMike,t2_2qlyo,"Yeah, exhaustion and groups are a big part of my solo experiences, usually.

Another thing I've learned is - if you are bored with a place - leave!  Yeah, maybe the place you picked is a destination, but if you don't like it, hop on Google and take a look at what is either nearby otherwise, or on your route home (if driving or otherwise freely traveling besides flying).

LikesTheTunaHere,t2_t200n,"Ive been watching this sub for years and ive been solo traveling for 15-18 years now on the semi regular. Normally 2-6 weeks a year, but a few years I did 8-16 weeks. 

I 1000 percent agree with you, that said I love me a museum or other cool attraction. Not so much random flashy tourist shit, however since i dont make big cities my destination I'm not seeing that stuff on the regular so its still cool to me. 

I've always traveled for camping\\motorcycle camping and to ride on the nicest roads and a few years ago got into downhill mountain biking. 

None of those things really ever have me near big cities, I know for many thats what they like traveling for but its not my deal. I also skip almost all tourist attractions these days and have for pretty much forever. 

I seen a few of the famous things as a kid and while they were cool af, they were never my favorite things on the trip. As an adult my first trip took me past Mount rushmore, into San Fran for all that stuff and some other famous crap. Oddly enough, none of that made a favorites list for the trip. 

Yellowstone to me is cool for little kids and the big ol blow holes and stuff around them. Otherwise, I've been to the mountains and the prairies, them anermals ain't all that rare. For some, sure but if your a ""traveler"" you've probably seen that shit. 

Even my favorite places to camp\\see for nature are not on the vast majority of things you must see and I'm not picking super crazy niche out of the way shit its just less commercialized so its not as popular. 

Just outside Yellowstone, like an hour away has some AMAZING camping also, the tetons are spectfuckingtactular to look at. I didn't see a campground in the valley that let you get the whole valley experience but it would be cool, that said, lots of other places that are similar in the world. 

I don't think I could handle a big euro\\asia standard college kid solo adventure, it never appealed to me even when i was that age or younger.

fellscreature,t2_8k1j724z,"I know you don't want to drive on the interstate, but the reasons you've given don't really line up with the experience of driving cross country. I've done a lot of I-90 heading into Montana, and the vast majority of the time it's empty. Unless you hit a city at rush hour, you won't run into traffic.

Another thing to consider is that it's very hard to get across the whole country on empty rural roads. A lot of major two lane highways can be busy, go through major settlements, and carry lots of trucking.

That being said, there are lots of great two-line blacktops west of the Mississippi, and it can be worth deviating from 90/80/70 for the scenery alone, although those interstates also have great views.

Anyway, whatever you do, good luck and stay safe! And don't drive too long after dark on a long haul day.

And... driving on interstates is really useful. It's a huge pain in the ass to get around the whole country without interstates. They're absolutely not safer, statistically, than rural roads (according to the NTSB), and worth getting used to. Also worth noting -- if you time your trip right, it's possible to make it all the way across the country on interstates without running into heavy traffic, with good timing or judicious use of state/local roads to route around major cities.",1630846636,hbok5bd,t3_pi5fep,/r/solotravel/comments/pi5fep/no_interstate_road_trip_across_america/hbok5bd/,1,solotravel

I'm American, fully vaccinated and flew into Paris August 30. Applied for the health pass before I left but didn't have it upon arrival, so went to a pharmacy straight from the airport and they were able to get me the pass in ~20 minutes. Later that day the pass I applied for online was sent back to me (with my first name wrong smh). I applied a week before I left.

The pass proved useful in Paris as it was scanned many times at restaurants and museums. Could I have gotten in with the CDC card? Idk.

Took the train to Amsterdam September 3 and my pass was not scanned at the border/train station, no one ever bothered to look at my passport at all come to think of it. Amsterdam seems much more lax on the COVID front than Paris did. Masks aren't as prevalent here and aren't even *required* at every museum. 

The one thing that is required in both places if you plan to visit museums and the like is reserving a time slot. I've had to do that everywhere I've gone save for Fontainebleau thus far. So if you are more of a freewheeling traveler (such as myself), you'll need to adjust a bit.

AskALocal,t2_d57t69vc,"I've done this a bunch of times in various countries. My main piece of advice would be: do things!If you don't know what your interests are, and even if you do: try things!

&amp;#x200B;

Find groups that do activities that you're interested in (Meetup is great in some areas, especially cities, but likely won't have much in smaller towns). Take classes. Go to a park. Join a sport team. Find a language exchange. If you're just reading, buy a coffee or a beer and do it somewhere public. Be a little weird and strike up conversation. Ask people questions, even if just about something new to you that you're seeing happen in front of you. Ask about the news. Whatever. They might not always respond positively and most will lead to nothing, but as you'll be a foreigner, some people will be curious too and you never know what comes of it. If nothing else, you'll have some interesting conversations (and language practice!)

&amp;#x200B;

Making friends is much easier through activities. It takes the pressure off. An art class, a course of some type, a sport, join a gym, etc. all afford you the opportunity to meet and interact with people, but without it seeming like a ""friend date"". If you hit it off, it's easy after a few weeks to casually ask if the person wants to grab a coffee, a beer, meet you to do something, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Recognize that it takes time to make friends and lots of interaction will be awkward. Embrace it. An awkward interaction lasts a few minutes. Everyone will survive and they're not the end of the world :) You'll also spend a lot of time alone initially. That's ok. It gives you time to figure out, in the absence of external pressure and expectations, what you like, are interested in, want to do... Practice your hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of all, be open to new experiences and don't expect them to come to you.Have a great time and good for you for taking the leap!

Solo traveller from Singapore here! Started my Youtube channel last year in the middle of the lockdown, using photos and videos from a previous London to Overland train journey.

Originally wanted to focus on just train overlanding, but leisure travelling is pretty much out of the question now due to the pandemic and travel restrictions. So I had to expand on other travel related topics.

I personally feel that your money would go further in Chicago and you would have a less stressed vacation, but IF YOUR HEART IS SET ON NYC, here is one way to do it within the budget you are looking at.

Keep in mind that this will be an exercise in discipline.

1. Plan to stay in elizabeth NJ and use path to get into the city.  Use one of the Aggregators (orbitz, expedia) to get a reasonable rate for the week.

2. Purchase an MtA weekly pass,

https://new.mta.info/

It will get you back and forth from the hotel and many of the sights you will see.

3. Have a general plan for each day.   Flesh out before you leave your must see list and break it into two categories under 10$ and over 10$. Make sure your plan groups your ""must see's"" together by location.

Take a look at this list:

https://www.6sqft.com/100-things-to-do-in-nyc-that-are-completely-free/

4. Every year New York Magazine posts an article on the best cheap food in NYC.  Before you leave, review the last couple articles and map where these places are relative to your ""must see's"".

https://nymag.com/tags/cheap-eats/

5.Have  couple of hundred dollars accessible in credit/cash that you can access quickly.   NYC is the land of $8.00 bagels and 10.00 cups of coffee.

I hope you have a wonderful time, there is no place like NYC.  Just remember you have to be disciplined and enjoy yourself!!!",1630758132,hbk7lix,t3_pgn8c9,/r/solotravel/comments/pgn8c9/is_700_enough_for_8_days_in_new_york_flights/hbk7lix/,0,solotravel

1. Take a boat tour of Chicago architecture.   If it is sunny and calm, there are few getter things to help you understand the the buildings that you see.   Chicago is where the first skyscrapers appeared.  It will be really informative.

2.Ride the Brown line from end to end.   It is the only line that is a circle. meaning you will end where you start.   You will get to see the neighborhoods and the loop.   This trip will allow you to see much of chicago that you wouldn't see if you stayed in the tourists zones.

https://www.transitchicago.com/brownline/

3. Go to the Merchandise mart.   At one time, it was the largest building in the world. There is art flashed across the building exterior in the evenings.

4.Take the green line to Oak Park avenue and walk to Frank Lloyd Wright studio.   There are several examples of his work in the neighborhood.

5. Make sure you see the Picasso sculpture in Daley Center.   Google the history behind how it got here.

6. Go see the Watertower.  it is one of the few things that survived the Great Chicago Fire.   From here you can do one of two things.   ONe is walk the magnificent mile.   It is a must see and provides wonderful views and shopping.   The other is equally important, I think.   

Walk State street, south towards Jackson.  It is nicknamed, ""The Great Street"" and you can see some of the examples of  the great Chicago retailers.   For example, The Carson Pirie Scott building is now a Target and the Marshal Field Building is now a Macy's

7.  Lastly, go to the Harold Washington Library.  It is the main library and is huge.

The freedom of not having to rely on other people to enjoy yourself.  

&gt;What do you enjoy the most while traveling? Is it the food, getting to know people, explore new places, etc

The world of tourism is fun. Being in a museum or art gallery at 11am on Tuesday morning when you know everyone else is on some boring Zoom call is great! Being in a quirky cafe or bar reading a good book where nobody knows you is great. The  ""other worldliness"" of tourism is what I most enjoy. Meeting fellow travellers from different cultures is also fun. They usually will have a different mindset to your colleagues or friends back home and this can be mind expanding. 

The biggest mistake you can make when solo travelling is going with the expectation that the trip is going to be meeting travellers from all over the world everyday. Yes, this does happen but you can also go through patches where you're totally alone and the only person you will speak to will be the hostel / hotel receptionist. However, going with the expectation that this is part and parcel of the solo travel experience and not expecting to everyday to be like a scene out of Friends, you're likely to have a much more enjoyable time.",1630762175,hbkeh83,t3_phfduh,/r/solotravel/comments/phfduh/my_first_solo_trip_im_excited/hbkeh83/,1,solotravel

Organic_Armadillo_10,t2_9gltqt79,"Thanks to Brexit I now have to deal with this (as I had been living with family in the Shengen zone). And it's definitely complicated - and I'm not sure how they can actually tell (if there's a notice when your passport is scanned?) or if it's just down to luck whether they actually check or not.

I was down to 2 weeks left of my 90 days, so am now in Croatia for probably 6 weeks as they are one of the few with a separate 90 days, till my clock resets. 

I've literally just been tracking the length of stay in each country - saving that all in my phone and having a running total at the bottom. Along with the dates when I've hit that 180 days from my first day, and it starts to eat into the next one. 

Although once that happens it's going to be a lot of math and double checking. As others have said a spreadsheet is probably more ideal to track it. 

The easiest way (though not convenient or always possible) is to probably do one month in, one month out... So you can just alternate every other month for a year.",1630770681,hbkwgd9,t3_phghug,/r/solotravel/comments/phghug/best_way_to_track_schengen_visafree_period/hbkwgd9/,2,solotravel

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"It’s been a few years since I was last in NYC. A few thoughts nonetheless:

\-sounds like your AirBNB is in Harlem, which for many years was unsafe. This neighborhood has improved some over the years and should be okay during the day, but can still be sketchy after dark, especially the later you get.

\-you can indeed eat cheap here, but one of the big draws in NYC is its food scene — the city is a major foodie mecca. Visits to Gray’s Papaya and food carts are only part of the experience. Great deli (Katz’s, Second Avenue) and pizza (John’s, Grimaldi’s) and bagels (Murray’s) are available if not rock bottom cheap. There’s also great ethnic food here, which usually won’t break the bank, but also isn’t dirt cheap. There are also great fancy eateries that aren’t going to work on your budget.

\-several museums (and there are scads of them, including world class ones) have free days or hours during the week or certain times of the month. It’s worth the research to find out when. Since COVID, though, more attractions are requiring timed and prepaid entry. Check first.

\-for many NYC visitors, a Broadway show is a must. Those are usually fun, but cost plenty.",1630653421,hbf49bm,t3_pgn8c9,/r/solotravel/comments/pgn8c9/is_700_enough_for_8_days_in_new_york_flights/hbf49bm/,3,solotravel

george_sand_,t2_13q9vf,"I did a similar trip a few years ago and it was amazing! Stayed in a airbnb for &lt;$40 a night in Washington Heights for 11 days. The apartment I stayed in was fine...near Columbia University, but there were cockroaches which freaked me out at first, but then I settled down and went on a killing spree. 

I bought a 7 day pass metro card twice to get around and did a lot of walking which was a fun way to see the city. 

A great way to save money is to go out for only 1 or 2 meals a day. I brought some food with me...a giant bag of almonds, high calorie granola bars, etc. You also don't have to go out for expensive food. Go to ethnic restaurants. You can also go shopping for apples or bananas or whatever. 

There is so much stuff you can do for free in nyc!! I went to a ton of churches to look at architecture and appreciate history. Trinity Church in wall street where Alexander Hamilton is buried, St. Paul's Chapel very close to Trinity church. St patrick's cathedral, St. Bartholomew's Church, and St. Thomas Church are all very close and next to the Rockafeller center. The Church of St. Francis Xavier and a hundred others. 

Take the staten island ferry for free, walk across the brooklyn bridge, explore the parks, go to coney island and take a dip in the atlantic, go to chinatown, go to boro park in brooklyn (hasidic jewish neighborhood), and nyc library which is like a museum itself. Befriend some locals and have them show you around. It will be memorable!

Save your money for things like the Met, Natural history museum, top of the rock, statue of liberty/ellis island, broadway, jp morgan library, frick collection, cloisters etc. And really make sure you see the cloisters. It was probably my favorite thing in nyc! You might actually save money not doing the nyc pass, idk. 

I would suggest planning your days in advance so you see things that are near each other. The city is huge and you want to make the most of your time.

kimbabs,t2_5l84g,"Yeah, don’t forget tax. It’s 8.75% here.

Basically take whatever you eat and add 28.75% on top with tip (assuming 20% tip).

This combined with the fact that at a random joint, a beer can already be $8.

NYC is a culinary melting pot and you can find representative foods of that from every corner of the world. I highly recommend sampling it, and going beyond manhattan to local spots in Brooklyn or Queens is the best way to do that in my personal opinion.

That said, cheap IS doable, but it takes careful planning. Pizza and bagels are the best out of anywhere you’ll find it in the US, even out of a random mom and pop joint or your local bodega. You’ll also find fast casual from places around the world (gogo curry is great), or just random eats (viet, thai, chinese, if you order just like 1 dish). Don’t expect to be sitting inside too often for a $15 (with tax and tip) meal though - in general, real estate is pretty prime and spots here can be small and have limited seating.

Realistically though, if you’re not careful about planning every meal and just waltz into a random restaurant in the UES, you can expect to pay $30 just for a mediocre meal. Also, idk how $15 a meal was possible in London.

Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania *are* all members of the EU. The Schengen zone is a different treaty. Most but not all EU countries are also Schengen countries. There are also countries that are not part of the EU but are part of Schengen (like Switzerland and Iceland).

It is better to think of the EU and the Schengen zone as separate entities. There is a lot of overlap but they are not identical. So if you are planning to alternate 90 days in and out of Schengen, you should be looking at a [list of Schengen members](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/), not a list of EU members.

&gt; So my question is, does anyone here have an estimate (if that’s even possible) of when that 90-day rule exemption will no longer be a thing? Could it happen any time?

&gt; I find it as a way to share some commentary + sharing what Europe is like because a lot of my friends haven’t been able to travel because of covid

Commentary is fine, but I would try to avoid the mentality that you're sharing these things for your friends who can't experience them. That kind of attitude gets annoying really fast.

lattelover2323,t2_e3sq0qu1,"I have a follow-up question for OP and others - any destinations women have had a BAD experience with on solo travel? I’m a 31 YO woman with a couple of interesting circumstances that led me to travel solo to various Asian countries (work), European cities considered by some to be “dicier” (Istanbul, Naples, Athens, Budapest) (personal), and Africa and the Middle East (Ethiopia, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman) (visiting my SO overseas but traveling alone for various days of the trips). I’ve also traveled to some of the locations routinely considered “the best and safest” for female solo travelers.
Obviously, there is a degree of enjoyment and perceived comfort that made differences in my solo travels in places such as Stockholm and Oman. I’m also blonde, so had to overcompensate for the attention that would draw in places like the Middle East and Asia, and sometimes it was merely impossible (ex. I was detained in the Bahrain airport on the suspicion I was a prostitute and solicited while walking solo in a park in Tokyo). Frankly however, I’ve encountered uncomfortable situations in seemingly “safe” environments and places women would be more on guard in alike. 
Rather than location environment per se, in my experience, my level of security, safety, and perceived comfort revolves around (1) absolute awareness and adherence to the customs to blend in as much as possible (clothing color, body coverage, perceptions of women, not toting luggage around advertising tourist status, not staring at phone or map for directions, etc.), (2) walking confidently and remaining alert (i.e. merely giving the impression that I have a right or purpose in being there seems to go a long way - many of the uncomfortable incidents I encountered were times I was lost, obviously looking around, unsure), (3) research and knowledge about the neighborhoods, modes and methods of transportation, and accommodations to stay in, which began to develop naturally and intuitively after years of travel. Some of the latter involved knowing when to “splurge” (i.e. when I couldn’t risk taking public transportation, stay at a less-reputable hotel or hostel, etc.) as well as simply following my gut when a particularly neighborhood or even block didn’t feel right. I guess my query is: (aside from obviously war-torn or unstable places) are there really unsafe places for female solo travelers as a bright line rule, or do women confront the same risk and pitfalls as all travelers being thrust into unfamiliar circumstances, just higher because the commonly perception of women being “more vulnerable” potential victims? If the latter, could women reduce the risk of being targeted as travel victims by using the methods above (research, knowledge, awareness) and acquiring a skill and confidence of travel?",1630489270,hb624oh,t3_pfahsm,/r/solotravel/comments/pfahsm/first_time_really_solo_travelling_for_a_week/hb624oh/,2,solotravel

cosmicpr0xy,t2_4z2i8d1h,"I am assuming you are located in the USA? If so, start building up a credit history. If you have no credit card or credit history, then start with a secured card first. Use your card for everyday purchases and then (this is VERY important) pay it off within the billing cycle. If you don’t pay it off within the billing cycle, it will go against your credit and banks charge interest rates for late payments (most Americans are here and don’t know how to manage money). NEVER put anything on a credit card that you can’t afford to pay off right away. Make sure you budget well. If you are terrible at budgeting and keeping track of money, then don’t even think about getting a credit card and work on money management FIRST. 

Once you build up your credit history, you can go after travel credit cards that offer points and or cash back. These points/cashback can be used to travel for almost free or at a very minimal cost. This is what I do to travel and it doesn’t cost me much because I use the banks money to travel, which they offer through points/cashback. I get to travel anywhere I want without barely touching my own money. I am literally spending the banks money because I know how to manage my money and I am not in debt. This is the key to travel. You can check out communities like r/churning for more information on how you can use credit cards to your advantage, or places like flyertalk a forum for savvy travelers.

Like, he’d work for the yacht owner doing anything from cooking/cleaning to helming the yacht to a destination where the yacht owner was going to be. Managed to go all over the place from South Africa to South America, plenty of Europe, etc.

He was kind of a really likeable person, eventually he saved up enough money to buy his own small yacht (worth like 100k or so I guess? Not a big massive yacht but enough to travel aboard)

If you don’t get seasick and consider the risk of dying at sea to be fun then there’s an option

Also this dude was no stranger to roughing it. Pretty sure he lived in a cave for like 6 months before a park ranger decided he had to go.

gypsyblue,t2_4xoqe,"Cool! My city recommendations would mostly depend on your specific interests (are you into history? food? bars? monuments? museums?) but I can already give some general advice:

In Dresden:

* I strongly recommend booking your accommodation in Neustadt, on the north side of the Elbe. Most of the tourist attractions are in the Altstadt on the southern side of the Elbe, but that side was basically obliterated by Allied bombing in 1945, so outside the small reconstructed historical area it's not that exciting. The Neustadt maintained most of its historical buildings and is today a big 'alternative'/student/bar district. It has great nightlife, restaurants, street art, shops, etc... overall just a *cool* place to stay, and the liveliest neighbourhood in Dresden. Neustadt has its own train station (all trains from Berlin to Dresden, and all trains from Dresden to Saxon Switzerland, stop at Dresden-Neustadt) and depending on where you stay, it's just a short walk across the bridge or an even shorter tram ride into the attractions in the Altstadt.

* Definitely go to the Grünes Gewölbe (the Green Vault). It's basically the treasure collection of the former Kingdom of Saxony and it's amazing. The rooms themselves are very beautiful. It also has some very interesting exhibits on which rooms were damaged during the war and how they were (or weren't) rebuilt.

* If you're in Dresden between Sept 10 and Oct 3, there's a big *Herbstmarkt* (basically a fall market / fall festival) on the Altmarkt square. It's kind of the famous Christmas market, but smaller and fall-themed. They have booths with lots of local and seasonal specialties like Federweißer (a sweet, immature carbonated wine which you can only get in fall) served with Zwiebelkuchen (onion quiche) or Flammkuchen (a thin/crispy 'pizza'-type dish from Alsace made with a white cream sauce plus cheese, onions and ham).

* Depends on your taste, but I like to hang out at the Ostpol bar/club in the Neustadt, a trendy 'Ostalgie' (East German nostalgia) place which is purposely set up to look a bar from the Communist days. They have a lot of live music and it's just a fun/unique atmosphere. Other fun places: the Lebowski Bar (a Big Lebowski-themed bar that plays The Big Lebowski in a loop on TVs around the bar), Wohnzimmer (lit. 'living room', a cozy, shabby chic bar), Katy's Garage (an iconic local Biergarten), Planwirtschaft (lit. 'planned economy', a trendy restaurant with German cuisine), Raskolnikoff (a trendy restaurant with typical Central/Eastern European comfort food), and my absolute favourite restaurant in Dresden: Bautzener Tor, which serves local beers plus terrific Saxon and Bohemian food. All these places are in the Neustadt.

In Saxon Switzerland:

* When travelling from Dresden (on the S1 - the main train that goes to Saxon Switzerland), sit on the left side of the train (relative to the direction of travel) - this is the outwards-facing side that gives you the best views as you travel through the Elbe river valley.

* The most popular and IMO best hiking maps of Saxon Switzerland are the ones published by Rolf Böhm, which you can [get on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Rolf-B%C3%B6hm/dp/3910181090/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&amp;qid=1630498806&amp;refinements=p_27%3ARolf+B%C3%B6hm&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-11&amp;text=Rolf+B%C3%B6hm) or in any travel/hiking/tourist shop in Dresden. The maps themselves (handdrawn) are very beautiful, making them nice souvenirs, and Böhm himself is kind of a notorious local activist who has gotten in trouble with the park authorities for including 'unofficial' trails on his maps... he's very well known and so using his maps is a very 'local' experience.

* The typical ""main sight"" in Saxon Switzerland is the Basteibrücke (Bastei Bridge), which is cool, but I suggest continuing past the bridge to the Schwedenlöcher (lit. 'Swedish Holes'), a really cool system of gorges not far from the bridge. You can google it for pics; it's really pretty.

* One of the other main sights is Königsstein Castle, which looks impressive, although I have to be honest... I haven't actually been there. I think it looks cool enough from the outside and haven't felt too pressured to actually go inside.

* The actual core of the national park is located further south, between the S-Bahn stations of Bad Schandau and Schöna. I can recommend some hiking routes that take you through the most 'fun' parts of the core of the park, if you have time for that. Saxon Switzerland isn't a natural mountain range in the normal sense but is composed of huge sandstone formations, so you can do some really fun routes that involve a lot of 'climbing' (usually secured with metal grips, stairs and railings so you don't have to bring real climbing gear - it's like regular hiking but more of a full-body workout).

* Again... only if you have time... the national park actually extends across the border to the Czech Republic, so you can easily go over to the Czech side of the park too. The most famous site over there is the [Pravčická Brána](https://www.google.com/search?q=prav%C4%8Dick%C3%A1+br%C3%A1na&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvJEZa6Zt9cbyRfdNzhBBxFUD4RAOA%3A1630498559912&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=577&amp;ei=_24vYdaNNOeSxc8P78uRgAg&amp;oq=prav&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAxgAMgcIIxDvAxAnMgcIIxDvAxAnMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgARQ9AFY5Axg9xdoAXAAeACAAZUDiAG6C5IBCTAuMS4yLjEuMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1n&amp;sclient=img), which you can actually reach in an easy hiking loop from the Dresden S-Bahn station Schöna, including boat rides across sections of the [Edmund Gorge](https://www.google.com/search?q=edmund+gorge&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTtv294N3yAhUGMRoKHVS5C8cQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=edmund+gorge&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQGDoHCCMQ7wMQJzoFCAAQgAQ6BggAEAUQHjoGCAAQCBAeUJucBVjXtwVgybkFaABwAHgAgAHCAYgBog2SAQQwLjEymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=BG8vYdOkIobiaNTyrrgM&amp;bih=577&amp;biw=1280) and the [Wild Gorge](https://www.google.com/search?q=wild+gorge&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwin28bp4N3yAhURKhoKHbZdDNIQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=wild+gorge&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMggIABAIEAcQHjIICAAQCBAHEB4yCAgAEAgQBxAeMggIABAIEAcQHjIICAAQCBAHEB4yCAgAEAgQBxAeOggIABAHEAUQHlCUjANYn5IDYJqVA2gAcAB4AIAB1gGIAdwFkgEFMC4yLjKYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=X28vYeevOZHUaLa7sZAN&amp;bih=577&amp;biw=1280).

There is plenty to do around Kranjska Gora and in Soca valley, people spend week's holidays there. Kobarid (along Soca) has a nice museum related to WWI (years ago it got a title European museum of the year or something similar) with few open air locations as well. There was a WWI frontline along there (described by Hemingway in A Farewell to arms).
Mountain trails, waterfalls, climbing, zipline, canyoning, whitewater rafting...depends on the temperatures at the time of your visit.

Another nice museum is mountaineering museum in Mojstrana. Apart from interesting content in regards to muntaineering, you can borrow climbing equipment (helmet, harness, self-protecting set) and climb ferata Mojstrana in front of the museum (or two such trails in Gozd Martuljek nearby).

Regarding vineyards, there are several regions in Slovenia with different kinds of wine. I am keen of Goriska Brda, hills in southwest of Slovenia. Perhaps try Dominik Sosolic, I enjoyed many of his red vines.

Slovenia is developing towards sustainable tourism, but that is still tourism. Many people live from tourism revenues and therefore appreciate (responsible) tourists. Therefore you will not run in many people who will have anything against you. Now, if you dig deep enough in some village bars, you may get into troubles. But so may I just being from a different village :)

Regarding more history, Slovenia is full of medieval castles, also some Roman remains in Ljubljana and in the eastern part of Slovenia. Many castles are renovated (Bled, Škofja Loka, Strmol,...), many are in ruins (Begunje, Socerb, Celje...).

Around Bled, you may do easy trails for splendid views over lake and castle, you may visit Vintgar gorge or Pokljuka gorge, do some ziplining, row to the island...

Organic_Armadillo_10,t2_9gltqt79,"Saying this with years of experience, travelling to 70+ countries. Not sure where you're from or going to (which would be a help to give better advice), but travelling to a foreign country ONLY with cash isn't sensible. Especially these days where things are constantly changing (potentially leaving you stuck somewhere longer), and covid tests can be expensive... A couple of covid tests alone could potentially wipe out that money instantly. 

It's simple enough these days to get an account with an online bank (takes minutes to set up and a few days to get your card). They always give the best bank rates so you'll be saving money compared to exchanging cash. If you aren't old enough which it maybe sounds like, then you probably shouldn't be travelling like that anyway. 

Keep in mind that a lot of places, especially accommodation (depending where you're staying) may not take cash payments - some places require a card (to cover potential damages...) or to secure a booking. 

Not to mention with a card you can just withdraw cash from an ATM on arrival and not get completely ripped off by exchanging money - I went to Mexico on my first solo trip. Changed money in the airport (not knowing exchange rates and was very new to travelling alone) - got completely ripped off (I got £25 less than I should have from maybe $100). So exchanging $500 will probably end up more like $450 or less if exchanging it all. 

If you really are going to travel only with cash - and that's all the money for your trip, you'll be best off spreading it around your bags.  That way if you lose your wallet or get robbed, you have some money on you. An empty lip balm tube is a good place to hide money. Obviously don't just keep loose cash in your pockets - you are guaranteed to lose some of it that way.

You ALWAYS need emergency money too (I'm guessing you probably don't have travel insurance if you don't have a card, which I'd highly recommend, especially travelling just now). You'll likely spend more than you expect. As others have said $17 a day really is nothing to live on for a month - that would be living on an extreme budget daily which isn't enjoyable. Unless you have already free accommodation/meals. But again not knowing more details/where you're going makes it much harder to give better advice. The only places I can think of that would be that cheap mostly aren't open to tourists yet. 

I'm going to a 'technically cheap' country tomorrow - I've already spent £700+ on travel insurance and accommodation for the first 3 weeks. That's not including any meals or activities yet... And from travelling the last 7 years, know that there will always be unexpected costs. 

I've also travelled with multiple people who lost their cards - had a good amount of cash on them. And they were running out of cash within days and were having to borrow from other people (transferring money to their accounts to pay them back - another reason for a bank account). 

Overall - get a bank account and cards before you travel (it will really save you a lot of cash, worrying and hassle in the long run). It's a basic thing you need for day to day life anyway. Double check your budget again, and take more than you think (at least $100 emergency money that you do not touch and keep hidden away). $500 probably won't go as far as you think it will. If you absolutely have to travel only with cash - spread it out as much as you can in multiple bags. And try to never have it all on you at once (other than obviously travelling between places). And highly recommended having some sort of health/travel insurance. Even one minor accident and unexpected medical costs for something small will mess up your planned budget.",1630405655,hb1h0lv,t3_pevhro,/r/solotravel/comments/pevhro/first_time_traveling_with_cash_only_i_need_advice/hb1h0lv/,5,solotravel

Organic_Armadillo_10,t2_9gltqt79,"I wrote a long response - but I don't get it either. I've had a bank account since I was little - and don't really get how you can get by without a bank account and paying for things online these days. On top of that because of Covid, many places don't take cash now (although somewhere you can live for $17 a day I'm sure still would). 

I'm from the UK - I have my main bank account. And then opened up accounts with Revolut, Starling, Monzo, Wise for travel cards. It took 5 minutes to sign up on the apps, and got the cards in a few days.

I travel with all those cards (most in my wallet - a few somewhere else kept in my bag) so I have multiple backups to pay. You can lock them on the app if they go missing. They also give the best rates so you aren't ripped off by foreign exchange places. I take out some local cash from an ATM when I arrive, and I also make sure to have £100+ worth of emergency cash I can exchange if I absolutely have to. I wouldn't travel anywhere without at least one bank card. 

There used to be places you could maybe get by on $500 for a month (Laos/India...) but pretty sure none of those are open to tourists yet. And even still $17 a day for transport, accommodation and 2-3 meals a day, plus activities and unexpected costs.... Not even including travel insurance or covid testing (which can be expensive depending on the place - it would be so much more helpful to know where they're going). 

That's an extreme budget though anyway - you won't be eating much or sleeping in nice/clean places, especially towards the end of the trip.",1630406874,hb1ilzl,t1_hb13m2d,/r/solotravel/comments/pevhro/first_time_traveling_with_cash_only_i_need_advice/hb1ilzl/,3,solotravel

Bolt_DMC,t2_492ofqi2,"Hitchhiking in the US can be a major crapshoot. You may do okay, but bad experiences are possible this way, you may find it hard to get rides in some areas, and in some locations it’s illegal to do so.

Be careful about dehydration and sunburn, as the Southwest is mostly desert. Make sure you drink a lot of water and wear sunscreen and sunglasses and a hat, especially in higher elevations. It’s very easy to burn here, and you can get in trouble with dehydrating easily. The latter can become a problem quickly. Drink water regularly, even if you don’t feel thirsty.

Agreed with the other posters that “seeing the country” via hitching or bus rides will not bear much visual fruit. The interest will be in destinations, not the journey. 

Note also that national parks are a major draw in this area, and you can’t reach them via public transportation — and while a few have shuttles that run through them, many do not. A car (or a bus tour via a company such as Adventure Bus or Green Tortoise) is a good way to get bang for you buck visually in this area.

NOLA is a major food destination (along with San Francisco, New York, and Chicago), so research your options here.

As far as a good stretch from Louisiana to New York, you’ve got a ton of choices. Places such as Great Smoky Mountains, Savannah, Charleston, Washington, and Philadelphia are options to consider.

driving across canada can be fun (have done it) but if you haven't been here, it's hard to explain just how HUGE we are. also, the drive across the prairies can be....uh...dull.

i'll tell you a story from many years ago when i was in high school. we had an italian exchange student we took with us on adventures. i didn't understand until years later when i went to europe myself - but we would drive from one urban centre to another but in the many hours between cities, he would constantly be asking 'so where are we now? what is this place?' and the only answer was 'nowhere, man. we aren't anywhere. this is nothing. it's forest and farms and highway for another 5 hours.' europe is...small. you're always somewhere...canada has an awful lot of 'nowhere' when you travel by car.

you might be better off taking the train between montreal and toronto (4.5 hours, plus, you don't want to drive in montreal) and then fly to the west coast. you'll need a car to get around vancouver island.",1630306274,hawg5lb,t3_pe2xa2,/r/solotravel/comments/pe2xa2/help_planning_a_solo_trip_to_canada/hawg5lb/,3,solotravel

coatofarmour,t2_h4r11,"Hi! I'm currently planning pretty much the same thing for next year - a trip through Canada, relying on trains and busses.  

I'll start on the West coast, fly into Nanaimo and then take the bus to Tofino, which takes around 3.5 hours. A few days later, it's back to Vancouver by bus and ferry. Vancouver has a direct train to Jasper / Edmonton / Winnipeg / Toronto, which departs twice a week in non-Covid times. Same with the train from Toronto to Vancouver. If you wanna go to Banff, there's busses between Jasper and Banff as well as Banff and Calgary. From Toronto, you have daily connections to Ottawa / Montréal / Québec. The train from Montréal to Halifax departs three times a week in non-Covid times - as another poster wrote, currently it's departing once a week in each direction. Assuming travelling to Canada will be possible when you're taking your trip, I'd wager/hope that the train schedule would be back to normal(ish).  

The train between Toronto and Vancouver takes like, four days. If you're in it for the journey and not ""just"" the destinations and have enough time scheduled, I'd say it could be worth it. And if you don't necessarily need a bunk bed to sleep, it's also quite affordable in Economy class. Maybe take a break in Winnipeg or Edmonton, though, spend a few days exploring one of the cities. Both of them should have enough to do for those two or three days to fly by.  

Now, re: cities to visit - do go to Vancouver. The city has lots to offer itself, but the real treat is the nature surrounding it. You can get to Whistler, Squamish and the Sea-to-Sky gondola by coach, take the public transport for the Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain, take the bus and ferry to Bowen Island, walk around Stanley Park, etc. pp. I highly recommend the city.  
I've been to Victoria before, too, and it's a lovely place to spend a few days. It has some quirky spots, small shops and cafés plus a great bookshop that I adored. And while I didn't go, I think there should be a few museums and botanical gardens in the city slash close-by, too.

Also, I don't know where in the UK you're from, but there are direct flights from London Heathrow to Halifax that take five-ish hours, so if London isn't too far away from you, maybe that's worth considering!  

Anyway, please feel free to DM me more questions or anything, especially regarding the trains (and busses) plus Vancouver, I'd be happy to help (or just to be excited together about our upcoming trips)!",1630314379,hawplc2,t3_pe2xa2,/r/solotravel/comments/pe2xa2/help_planning_a_solo_trip_to_canada/hawplc2/,2,solotravel

walker1867,t2_327u06m4,"I live in Toronto. The cities you mentioned are all great. Your fine without a car in Quebec/Ontario, public transit is useable and the trains between the cities are reliable. Toronto pride is at the end of June.


Calgary/Edmonton would be a good addition so you can go to Banff/Jasper, but it’s the kind of place where you’d want to rent a car. A lot of the things to do there don’t have any transit, or have poor infrequent service and are not in the towns. For this I’d recommend flying to Calgary, renting a car and going to Canmore, Banff, Lake Louise, and Jasper. You could return the rental car in Edmonton and fly out of there to minimize driving. For hiking in Alberta Johnston Canyon near lake Louise, the hike to the tea house at lake Louise, and little Everest in Kananaskis are all worth doing. A lot of hiking trails and some roads in the mountains don’t open for the summer until the end of May/beginning of June.


On Vancouver island I’d recommend getting a rental car. Goldstream is cool, there’s a wooden train bridge that’s cool to visit. Other places in the Victoria area to go to are the Buchart gardens, and Salt spring island. Doing a drive out to Port Renfrew to hike to Botanical Beach is worth doing. There are tons of other beaches to stop at on the way there and back. Goats on the roof in Coombs is a nice stop on the way to Tofino. Nanaimo is worth stopping in for Nanaimo bars, but I wouldn’t bother spending a night there.


St. John’s, Newfoundland (not to be confused with St. John, New Brunswick) might be a good addition, the had direct flights to London before the pandemic and 737 Max issues, and might get it back next year. There’s a nice walkable downtown area, Quidi Vidi is cool, and you can see puffins there. 


For flying domestically Porter is the best but they only fly to Ontario/Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. They might start flights to western Canada next year. Air Canada and Westjet are good if your flying out west. If your looking for a discount airline swoop is a possibility (they are owned by Westjet so they are probably reliable). Avoid Air Transat, Sunwing, and Flair as they all have limited domestic service and reliability issues.",1630326219,hax5py4,t3_pe2xa2,/r/solotravel/comments/pe2xa2/help_planning_a_solo_trip_to_canada/hax5py4/,1,solotravel

Being the cashier for the group *and* acting as a negotiator when hostilities broke out was not a relaxing position to be in and did not make me popular. Fortunately, the cliques all went their different ways once we reached Delhi, and I immediately jumped on the train to Agra to get away as quickly as possible. I travelled solo around India and Nepal for the next couple of months before I rejoined the group for the trip back.

The cliffs and the water are absolutely beautiful. It's home to 200-300 feet tall cliffs, spanning about 10 miles along Lake Ontario. Just please follow any signs if you decide to hike up there, because fatal accidents have occurred because of people ignoring them.  You could do it if you go to the zoo earlier in the day, then follow that by the bluffs, since they're both in the east end. Just a thought.

To achieve enjoying solo travelling, you absolutely need to be in the right headspace to do it. Going home isn’t failing, you’re only 20 and you have so much time in the future (near and far) to go travelling. 

To me, these cities (Barcelona and Madrid) are quite overwhelming for a first time solo travel. I am currently in Vigo, Spain on an Erasmus exchange semester and have been here for a few weeks and will be here until the end of December and I’m finding even this low-key city tough!

I was living with a family au pairing for 2 months in Aragón as I wanted to help myself transition to living alone and it was a great experience! I personally needed this transition period away from home before moving to a city alone. No shame in it! :)

If you want to continue travelling, my suggestion is to possibly look into au pairing. It’s a great way to see a new area, have some routine, and spend time with new people with a different culture. 

Or, if you aren’t looking to work, choose a smaller city that is less touristy. I would say to stay in a Spanish speaking area if that’s a language you are comfortable with would be more manageable. 

Around this time of year, you can also find lots of Erasmus students who speak English and attend organised events in cities all over!

AstraofCaerbannog,t2_8kw5os61,"Is this about Covid? The context of it, such as you knowing about the world makes me think that’s their reasoning? Which in that case, yes travelling for fun right now is selfish and borders on irresponsible. We’re in the middle of a pandemic, doesn’t matter our reasonings, that’s the reality. 

Saying that, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t travel. But it does mean you’ll need to take certain precautions and recognise that you are risking spreading the virus/different strains to countries which may not have decent healthcare, so making sure you’re double vaccinated and not hopping from one place to another as quickly as you may have prior to the pandemic would be a good way to go. Even setting up a teaching job or something like it before you leave so you’ll know where you’ll be could help. 

Sounds like you’ve been through a very hard time, and you’re very young still to have gone through so much stress and should have the opportunity to explore the world and get away from things. Not everyone responds to people travelling well. In my experience I prefer not to talk to people about travelling unless they’ve experienced it as people say all sorts of random shit. Both of my parents were all full of bad advice despite never having solo travelled in this way themselves, and I had to respectfully explain that this was my journey and I would make mistakes, but that I’d like them to be my mistakes rather than theirs. 

You mentioned in another comment that they don’t want to be worried about your safety. I feel like there’s a lot of context missing here, but if that’s the case then having a clear plan would be good. Or even going somewhere “safe” like Australia, Canada etc where you can do a working holiday.

as soon as i was done with high school (in 2009), i started traveling. i didn’t have any real money, i bought a ‘92 ford explorer, laid one of the back seats flat &amp; put a twin size foam mattress in it. i went where i want, &amp; i worked there to get money to get to the next place.

I think you're right, I actually think one day would be enough if it wasn't for the fact that I want to go to Bamburgh and I think doing it from Newcastle is the best option (instead of from Edinburgh). I haven't considered Durham though, I will check it out. Same as Glasgow.

&gt;
Also did London, Bath, Cardiff, Conwy, Caernarfon. Loved all of them. The castle in Conwy is especially good, and you can climb around on top of the old city walls. It’s a beautiful little town, too. This was in late November and early December. It was cold, but still enjoyable.

We visit albania every summer, or almost every summer. 

My parents ALWAYS made sure I knew to never leave the  beach alone and make sure that I don't make trouble in any way possible. Even if you don't do anything and just walk by, someone could get offended... 

An other insight, never leave your belongings alone... If you want to go for a swim in the sea or maybe go to the toilet never let ur stuff out of sight.. 

Personally, I would say that it can be 'save' for a woman to travel alone but I would NEVER go without having someone who checks up on me every 1-2 hrs as some kind of secure that nothing bad has happend to you and maybe a selfdefense weapon like a spray or even tazer... 

As bad as albania sounds from my comment, people are really lovely there ESPECIALLY the old folk. There just happens to be those who are really xenophobic and just can't deal with their anger issues... 

For your night life: Definitely don't stay out too late and make sure you are always under people since albanians usually have a strong sense for justice and will most likely help you out if u are getting harassed. Again a self-defense weapon is your best buddy here.

Worse yet, depending on your itinerary, you will be going up hill from roughly 3400 meters in Cusco to 4600 meters through the pass on day 2. That is really going to suck in terms of timing and is rough even if you have been at altitude for more than a couple days. Once you get past the pass, it will be easier as you both become acclimated and you mostly go downhill after that. 

I hate to be discouraging, but it will probably not be enjoyable those first couple days. I’ve not medicated to get over the high altitude, so I can’t offer you much there.

richdrifter,t2_29rc3nbv,"Age minimum in a hostel? If anything, there are sometimes age maximums. 

Hostels are generally cheap. Sometimes just a few dollars per night to stay in a bunk room with shared bathrooms, that whole thing.

But make no mistake, hostels can be a very lucrative business not unlike decent hotels, but with less overall expense. There isn't any incentive to seek out older guests. 

Cheap accommodation appeals to young backpackers with small budgets and low standards.

Older people can generally afford to spend more and prefer more privacy and less noise. 

I volunteered in hostels in EU &amp; Africa for about 4 years. Can confirm, guest age averages around 26 - 31 for a $26/night hostel. Cheaper hostels attract 18+ younger guests. Generally speaking though, you will always find a couple 50+ guests who are cool with the chaos. Usually old dudes who are still down to party and relive their youth.

I stopped volunteering when I felt that I aged out in my later 30's and got tired of the constant parties and dorm living - so I feel you, OP.

If you want to socialize with a more mature crowd you should look into guest houses.

Perhaps you can plan to go away for a summer with a relative who lives far from you, or in a camp-based program designed to provide a radically different setting, like Concordia Language Villages in MN.  My daughter, having spent 2 summers away in that MN program, was then sent overseas on her own at age 17, on an itinerary I structured for her.  She flew into London, spent a week there, and then flew into Dublin to travel to a well-supervised program mostly for college-age students on a remote Irish island.  She got back with experience and adventures she wanted but, also:

\--- she fell ill just as her week in London was ending yet nonetheless got herself to a Dublin hostel where she recuperated just enough to handle a full day of ground travel plus a ferry to her remote island venue, and

\--- during her month on the island, she had full access to alcohol because she looked old enough and was in with older students when they went out on their own on weekends, but she spent every penny of the emergency money I had given her, and then

\--- just when she needed to get back to Dublin to fly home, her ground transportation ticket became useless because of an employee strike, so she had to cobble together rides among her new friends to be able to catch her flight (it worked !).

Disasters narrowly averted, but I am sure you need a lot more travel savvy before heading out on your own, unless it is in a program where experienced people have responsibility for your welfare.",1630156738,haogk3i,t3_pd1o9a,/r/solotravel/comments/pd1o9a/i_want_to_travel_so_badly_but_i_dont_know_how_to/haogk3i/,1,solotravel

properfckr,t2_dgcvejtx,"The saying goes, a lifetime in Paris is not enough. Five days is a good start, however!

To this day Paris is one of the great cities of the world. Always has been. For anyone to dismiss it as ""over-rated"" is beyond ignorant. 

In terms of timing, I consider travel days to be the better part of one day. 

Travel times and hassles are worse now than ever with COVID protocols, etc. Getting to your train/plane/bus on time, checking in, going through security, waiting for it, travel time, finding your new hotel, settling in. 

It's a full day, especially if the journey is 4+ hours.

You may go out that night, but it's only the next day which is your first full, true day there.

I reserve judgement of all new cities for at least two days. 

Most cities are just as much about walking around various neighbourhoods and feeling the vibe, as it is ticking-off tourist spots from your list. 

Does the Eiffel tower disappoint? No! See it at night too! But to really enjoy the tower, have a pic-nick lunch in the park sitting in its shade!  

These are things you cannot rush through on a whirlwind trip, just as you can't rush an afternoon drink at a cafe in Montmartre. 

If you try to, you will probably end up thinking Paris is overrated. 

Travel is just as much about ""being"" in a place, as it is about ""seeing"" a place.

glglglglgl,t2_5779o,"First, there isn't a right or wrong way to solo travel, so try and avoid comparing yourself to other stories of travel. Remember too that people generally will talk about good days and not tell you about bad days.

Jetlag is awful and don't be hard on yourself about that. I have experienced US-Europe jetlag once and it took a week or more to return to normal for me, and that was me being at home/work and not the effort of solo travel.

You say you have money - perhaps look into having someone move your luggage for you between places? I don't know any services myself, but I'm sure they must exist and I've been with tour groups where that is done.

Amazon.es exists, so you can use Amazon easily. I don't know if they have it in all countries but using Amazon Lockers or drop-off points can be useful to save you having to wait for deliveries. (And if you have login details on a different Amazon site like Amazon.com then those will work on these too.)

It sounds like from your post that you want to be living somewhere for a while, rather than moving to a new place every few days - that's great. I think (though I may be wrong) that Madrid is one of the hottest parts of Spain, so perhaps moving towards the coast could help with the heat issues. A few Spanish friends have said that they would visit Italy and just speak Spanish with an accent and it would work like 8 out of 10 times - take that with a pinch of salt but perhaps Italy is an option for you too. Although with English, a translation app on your phone (Google Translate for me) and a patient attitude you'll get by in most places in Europe.

You mention logistics and yes, those can be hard and tiring. The travel blogs rarely talk about that. It's okay for that to be getting you down a bit. It's unavoidable though if you're moving around.

&gt; I should be having the time of my life.

This should be whatever you define it as. The classic ""party every night make out with the locals"" is one definition but not the only one. If you would like to spend your trip going to museums, that's fine. If you want to spend your trip living like a local, that's also fine. I went to the cinema a lot when I travelled - both as a little bit of escapism (when seeing films with English audio) and because I love films and the cinema, and seeing the regional differences was cool to me.

Please beware of people in the comments trying to diagnose you. A diagnosis is a very complex thing and only a professional can do that. I am telling you this because I myself fell into the trap of autodiagnosis and completely misunderstood my problem and dismissed it as depression. I dragged it on for a decade or so before realising the symptoms were the same but for completely different reasons.

Travel doesn't substitute a therapist. Travelling helps you find yourself, but first you need to know your diagnosis.

As an example of how I did it (WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANT THAT IT WILL WORK FOR YOU), I got diagnosed and then started moving from place to place, getting to know new people. 

First I got a diagnose and started therapy, which made me understand the root of my problems AND the harmful behaviour or thoughts I had to try and change.

Then when moving around I tried to start anew. Try to be a different person... find myself without those behaviours... Who I am without those harmful thoughts.

gypsyblue,t2_4xoqe,"&gt; Which option do you think I should go for?

I vote strongly for the nine month trip, assuming it means you'll get a student visa somewhere if you aren't an EU citizen (otherwise you'd have to balance Schengen/non-Schengen countries to stay within the 90 day Schengen limit for tourists).

&gt; I’m a female and will be 25 by the time I take the trip. Do you think it would be safe?

Yes. I'm Canadian who came to Europe (France) at 19 to study and have lived and travelled in Europe for several years now. It is very safe, with violent crime rates well below US levels.

&gt; Any tips on how to save up?

Minimise your living expenses as much as humanly possible. Get a side hustle. Avoid drinking and eating out. Think about how much fun you'll have in Europe instead.

If you're on a student visa, you may be permitted to work part-time hours, so you could consider some kind of short-term gig while travelling like English tutoring or working in a hostel. [Apparently the student visa is fairly easy to get in Spain.](https://dtravelsround.com/2015/06/09/getting-a-student-visa-for-spain-as-an-american/)

&gt; I’m very into anything culture, history, art, and coffee. Prefer to make new friends there but also spend some time alone. Any recommendations for cities to visit with friendly but laid back communities?

Barcelona and Madrid are both very good options in Spain. Barcelona is more laid back and it's much more popular with travellers than Madrid, but Madrid also has some of the world's best art museums, like the Prado. Personally I liked Madrid better.

Other cities in Europe that fit your 'profile' and are fairly cheap: Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Krakow, Ljubljana. Vienna is also lovely and is famous for its art, culture, and coffee houses, but is expensive (ditto Paris, Amsterdam and Munich).",1630059739,hajf1vt,t3_pcgog5,/r/solotravel/comments/pcgog5/planning_for_my_first_european_solo_trip_need/hajf1vt/,1,solotravel

That's kinda the point. 

I'm not suggesting that solo travel means you can't ever speak to someone else or hang out with others because a lot, although not all, solo travelers enjoy meeting and engaging with locals and other travelers on their trips. But, usually the point of traveling by yourself is to experience and enjoy the destination on your own terms. You shouldn't rely on meeting people via a ""dating app"" to make or break a solo trip... and by the way, most women aren't trolling the dating apps for the purpose of providing entertainment for someone who can't enjoy their time in a beautiful destination on their own or for a one night hookup with said person.

I'm not sure what you define as ""older"", but clearly you haven't gotten to the point where you can just enjoy your own company working in a beach destination that many would kill for the opportunity to do as opposed to an office or at home.",1630062312,hajilsx,t3_pcebhd,/r/solotravel/comments/pcebhd/having_a_bad_and_depressing_solo_travel_time_in/hajilsx/,16,solotravel

Misrabelle,t2_n1lwi,"A bunch of friends and I did a quick day trip into and out of Albania as part of a much larger Balkan road trip in 2018. 

It was hot, we were all pretty hungry, and so the decision was made as a group to find somewhere for lunch, where we could park a dozen cars, (and be able to keep an eye on them). We also needed somewhere that either accepted Euros, or card payment, as we didn't have any Lek on us, and really didn't want to have to get any, since we weren't staying.

Anyhow, we finally find a place as we're passing through Shkodër, someone goes in to see if it would be ok, and we get a thumbs up. So 17 of us pack into their dining room, and go about trying to order food. The owner brings his English speaking daughter to translate, and we ask for whatever they would eat amongst themselves at a party or similar. 

She says to leave it with her, and returns to the kitchen. What followed, was easily one of the top 10 meals I've ever had, anywhere in the world. We had SO MUCH food, the local dishes were explained to us, and everyone was really excited to see and talk to our group of friends (We're from countries all over the world, and we usually meet up somewhere once a year to travel and hang out together). They took photos with us, plied us with more food, and it was a really great atmosphere.

The total for the meal, all up with drinks came out at something like 80 Euros - so we gave them a generous tip. Sure, it was their job to be nice to us, but they really went all out to make us feel welcome, and give us a fantastic memory.",1630071103,hajypks,t1_hajuen2,/r/solotravel/comments/pckj8z/that_one_time_i_thought_i_was_getting_kidnapped/hajypks/,12,solotravel

Travel is just one of life’s many adventures. University was some of the best years of my life and is massive adventure in itself. And a privilege - just like travel. My friends in my home country are some of the most important people in the world too me, and are hands down more important than any “deep connections” I made in a hostel over a few beers. If they don’t want to talk about my travels then that’s fine. I want to hear how their jobs are going or how their new baby is or how their wedding day is that I miss. You can’t replace years of connection with people you met in 7 months of travel. I’ve met some awesome people out here I see as friends, but many I wouldn’t even piss on if they were on fire. 

You need to make being home and going home part of an adventure. Uni will open your eyes and change you in so many ways and test you in so many ways too. Just like things that your family and friends have done in the past 7 months you’ve been travelled has probably changed or challenged them. Be grateful for every chapter in your life and embrace it.

- You have changed and if the place, room, location, friends, painting on the walls, job don't suit you, don't dwell on it and change it!

geezeer84,t2_boj0h0tn,"I only lived four years in London but I have also some personal recommendations :)

Get a bagel from the north end of Brick Lane (Beigel Bake). The salted beef with a gherkin and mustard is very popular. It became very touristy in recent years. You can combine this visit with a individual street art tour in Brick Lane. A lot of stuff to see there.

When in Camden I can recommend to walk along the Regent's Canal to either King's Cross or Paddington Station.

When I did visit London as a tourist, we went to places where famous album covers were taken. For example, ""What's the story morning glory?"" by Oasis in Berwick Street, Soho. I think something similar is possible with movie locations. Additionally, go Abbey Road (for THAT beatles picture) or the Harry Potter platform is in King's Cross Station. When this is your cup of tea of course.

Museums have been mentioned already. I can recommend the National Gallery. They have a Rubens, Van Gogh, Michelangelo, da Vinci, ... But it is big. I had to go a second time to see everything.

I didn't go to clubs in London, but I went to a lot of pubs which played music on a Friday/Saturday evening with a DJ. I did enjoy that very much.

I love Naxos.  The hike to the top of Mt. Zas is great.  It’s the highest point in the Cyclades.  There are a couple of ways up there.  If you go up via Aria Springs and the Cave of Zeus, it’s kind of steep for about half a mile, but definitely doable.  Going up the other way by the church (whose name I forget) is easier.  I did a loop from Filoti and climbed up the back way past the cave and came down the front past the church.  Both paths are pretty well marked and well mapped on All Trails.   

The sunsets from the Temple of Apollo are gorgeous, and the beach scene at Agios Georgios beach is great.  Naxos also has a really good public bus system, so you don’t really need a car unless you want to go to the far side of the island for some reason.  

The guided tour of Delos is worth it IMO.  

I agree with the above poster about Mykonos-it’s not my scene.  I think the amount of time you’ve allocated there and including the day trip to Delos is fine though, especially if you’ve never been.  My favorite place there is the outdoor cafe and open air cinema in the middle of the old town.  It’s kind of hidden,  but once you find it, it’s a great place to get a bite and chill away from all the tourist.  

The itinerary looks great.  I think some people might find it a little rushed, but if you like to move around and pack a lot into each day (like me), it works fine!",1629971980,haemkfo,t3_pbgpd1,/r/solotravel/comments/pbgpd1/10_day_greece_solo_travel_itinerary_3rd_september/haemkfo/,1,solotravel

In Naxos, I'd like to spend a day at the beach though so maybe a beach day (or beach in Mykonos instead) and a hike day, though it seems a hike would finish early in the day. A lone meal in an authentic Naxos restaurant would be lovely, but two or three nights in a row? I'm unsure. I have considered swapping out a day of Naxos for a Delphi day trip in the first half of the trip, as I love Greek history, but I do worry this would make the Cyclades portion far too rushed.

Eki75,t2_mkvjc,"If it were me, I’d get to Naxos on Day 7.  Stroll around, visit the castle and museum, catch sunset at the Temple of Apollo, eat loads of gelato.  Day 8. I’d take the bus to Filoti and grab (a light) breakfast at one of the great cafes. Hike up to Zas stopping by Zeus’s cave on the way up and the church on the way down (I think it’s a 7-10 mile loop if I remember correctly), then bus back to Naxos Town for a nice dinner.  Then day 9, lay on the beach until you need to pack up for the airport.  When I was there, I planned two nights but had to stay 3 since all the ferries were canceled due to weather (apparently this is rare, so don’t worry) and I found that was just the right amount of time for me.  

I think the beaches in Naxos are way better than the ones in Mykonos.  

Delphi is amazing.  Many people do it as a day trip, but I don’t think I would, personally.  If you just want to see the big archeological sites, the two little ones, and the museum, it’s doable, but I loved the small town vibe and enjoyed overnighting there.  Personally, I’d do Delphi OR your day 3 plan, but not both.  If you love history, I don’t think you’ll have enough time in Athens if you add Delphi to your schedule.  I’ve not been to Corinth or Mycenae yet, so I can’t make a recommendation on which to go with.

For the first time I was doing a lot of different amazing stuff. Met a ton of people made friends. But when I came back home I get caught into a habit  to telling all my story to everyone whom I met. In that process I made a lot of people mad LOL ! they felt trapped when I throw all my stories to them..   So I learned that I can't share everything to everyone. The best thing is that we can share all our stories online to YouTube and in these solo travel communities where we will learn from each other.  Anyway you can always resume your adventure !

Noridem,t2_ioo771e,"Hey there!  


I'm from Wilderswil it's a small village next to Interlaken and has also a train station where you would drive through if you want to go from Interlaken to Grindelwald. So I know the location pretty well.  


I clearly can't predict the weather but there should't be a problem with the view. The thing is, even if it gets foggy, you can always go up and still have a beautiful view.  


Lets say it's really a foggy day you go to Grindelwald and you can't see shit. Then you can decide to take for example the ""Firstbahn"". and go to ""First."" You will go up so high that you overpass the fog. You then have the beautiful surroundings of ""First"" and you have an amazing view of the sea of fog   which you overpassed.  
You have to know it can get cold 2° (35.6 °F) in October. It may even have snow then but this is extremely rare and I don't think this will happen.   


As I said I can't predict the weather. It's a gamble but I wouldn't worry about the fog.  


Last note: hiking, ""paragliding, kayaking, taking the gondolas/boats/trains"" all out of these are 100% possible except the paragliding because I don't know which (weather) conditions you have to met to go paragliding. But the other things are 100% available even if it's a shitty day.

What you don't realize is that all those other people weren't just lying dormant when you were having your experience.  Some of them went deep into things which interested them.  One learned how to appreciate jazz music, another got into home brewing, another started meditation, another got his pilot license.

I have ridden a motorcycle all over the back roads of Vietnam/Laos/Cambodia.  It was a fantastic experience for me.  So I get the travel thing.  You and I could sit down and talk about our travels and we would both be very interested in hearing about each others experiences.

But you know what else I am very into, something which for me is even deeper and more interesting than solo travel?  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I can talk BJJ for hours.  It is a deep art which goes far beyond the sport/self-defense/fitness aspects.  It has been a truly life changing thing for me.

properfckr,t2_dgcvejtx,"Dear Fellow-Traveller,  
I've been a lifetime traveller and explorer, leaving and returning to Canada many times over the course of my 59 years.   
My wife and I sold our Vancouver house in 2008 and took our two kids (son 12, daughter 11) travelling around the world for one year.   
As we flew back to Vancouver after having had a full year of extraordinary experiences, from famous cities and landmarks to remote and little-known parts of the world, my 13 year-old son astutely remarked, ""I guess we're going to go back to being regular, old civilians now.""  
My first time back to Superstore after our trip to buy groceries in our old, everyday big box supermarket, not really having cooked for the past year, let alone shop in a banal Canadian supermarket rather than a cool Italian one, I actually began to cry real tears!!  
In fact the return was so painful, the thought of humdrum daily life so repugnant to me, that I vowed to remain a tourist for the rest of my life.   
I had been living in Vancouver, having moved there from Montreal in '92. I shifted my perspective and realized Vancouver was as permanent a home as Montreal had been, or our Italian villa we rented for two weeks, or the current house I had been renting with my family.   
I am a permanent tourist in my own life. This is, after all, a temporary, limited-time engagement.   
You are not stuck in your current circumstances, nor are you stuck in an old self.    
I write to you from Mexico, having come down here last December for a month or two, and have yet to leave.  
After agonizing over where I wanted to live since arriving here, I have once again shifted my perspective: Mexico is now my home base, and my return to Vancouver next week is only to put some things into storage, tie up loose ends, and return here for good.   
""Good"" meaning, ""good for now.""  
As a solo traveller (I've been divorced for 5 years), I have had to accept that the experiences I have had over the past few years, and really all the experiences of my entire life, are my own experiences.   
No matter how long I take, or how hard I try, I will never be able to communicate all of me, to another, have them understand my trip to India in 1984, the time I fell in love in Colombia in 2018, my solo road trip from Montreal to Vancouver in 1992.   
What is required is that you start to be happy about who you are, and what you do, and how you live, regardless of what others think or understand.  
Your life is your own, and as you live it you cross paths with many others, share experiences with them, share stories of these experiences, and then move on.   
Ultimately, as you know, we move on from all of it.   
Your hometown folks will never know or understand, and possibly accept you and your life experiences. Your own family might not!  
None of this important. You are a traveller on your own journey through life. You will learn to meet people on their own level, in their own context all over the world, including the people you grew up with.   
As your perspective grows, your understanding will indeed surpass theirs. This means you will always be able to understand them, but they will never fully understand you. And that is all well and good.   
Returning also forces you to face the person you were. You no longer want to be that person or see yourself as that person, which is why it is so important to you that you make everyone aware of the fact that you are no longer the old version of you.   
You have changed! And they need to recognize this!  
I tell you right now: they will not comply, and never accept you for anything other than that by which they know you.   
From their perspective, ""Oh you think you are so high and mighty having gone to the jungles of Guatemala, well you are not! You are one of us. So lay off that shit.""  
And so you shall. I have had a lifetime of experiences which I can bring up at any moment. But I don't. In a day to day work environment, rehashing old travel stories is not welcomed.   
In reinventing yourself, you may indeed have to move on from your old ties. This too is part of the ever-changing aspect of life.   
Hang on to nothing, and give yourself the freedom to be whoever you want to be, regardless of what others think.  
There is only one person on earth who needs to be happy about you, your life's experiences, choices, values.   
Your own personal satisfaction is something you carry around with you all the time, something which others sense. And that's all they need know about you, all the explaining you need to do.   
Inside, in this amazing life of yours, you are happy.",1629990751,haflort,t3_pbh952,/r/solotravel/comments/pbh952/post_travelers_depression_help/haflort/,3,solotravel

This will come across a little condescending, so I apologize in advance. You're 19. You would have changed anyway, regardless of travel. Youre growing up and beginning to make your own independent choices, something you might not have fully been able to do a year ago. As for your friends back home, everyone has changed too whether you've recognized that or not. Everyone has had to deal with a difficult and ever changing situation due to the pandemic, with its endless lockdowns and openings. You've had an incredible experience being able to travel long term, especially right now (remember some people can't enter other countries even if they're fully vaccinated).

Cherish those memories you've made traveling, and use them to fuel future adventures. But try to recognize what you were able to do was a privileged exception to the norm right now. Enjoy connecting with your friends and getting back into routine life again, something that really makes post travel depression go away quickly (I should know, I've lived overseas and backpacked for a year in Australia, NZ and SEA). I found that after the post travel sadness and isolated feelings (from being one of the only people in my friend group to have done long term travel) went away I found that I really appreciated the chance to get back into lifes routines and connect with the friends who continued life at home. And I didn't notice it at first, but over time I noticed my friends had changed with me too, but for different reasons, even if they liked the same things or went to the same bars and clubs.

gypsyblue,t2_4xoqe,"How long is your total trip? There are so many hidden gems in Poland, but if you're just there for one week, you'll already have your hands full seeing the main sights in those three major cities.

In and around Gdańsk:

(Gdańsk is one of my favourite cities in Europe so I have a lot of suggestions for it...)

* **Museum of the Second World War** - when I went it was excellent, one of the best museums I'd ever visited (and as a huge museum fan, I have visited literally hundreds). Probably the best museum portrayal of WWII that I'd ever seen. However, that was in 2017, and I've heard that the current Polish government has since changed it to make it more 'patriotic'...

* **European Solidarity Centre** - a museum and cultural centre dedicated to the 1980s 'Solidarity' trade union movement, arguably the most influential uprising in the Communist bloc, which began in the Gdańsk shipyards and forced the then-Communist Polish government to hold the first free, democratic elections in Communist Europe in 1989, before the Berlin Wall had come down. This is one of the most significant moments in recent Polish history and is still a big part of the culture.

* **Westerplatte** - a peninsula just north of the city centre that was used as a Polish military base in the 1930s. This is the spot where WWII officially began, when a German battleship began firing on the Polish military base on September 1, 1939. The ruins of the base have been left as a memorial, and it's possible to walk through the destroyed bunkers. There's also a large anti-war monument on site. I certainly had a very emotional reaction to the site.

* **Museum of the Polish Post** - a small museum and monument in the Polish Post Office. In the first days of WWII, the German army seized all the Polish government institutions in the city of Gdańsk (then Danzig), but the postal workers refused to surrender, barricaded themselves inside the post office, and fought back. They held out overnight, but the Germans eventually captured the post office and massacred the entire staff. It is a powerful story, and there is a very moving monument in the courtyard to show where the postal workers were lined up and shot. Also a famous moment in Polish history.

* Definitely stop by the **Artus Court** just off of the main pedestrian street in the Old Town. It's a beautiful pre-war community hall type building with gorgeous interiors and elaborate model ships hanging down from a starry ceiling.

* Just north of the main train station is the [**Cemetery of Lost Cemeteries**](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cemetery-of-lost-cemeteries), which is a small but beautiful memorial to the 'lost cemeteries' of previous generations of Gdańsk residents. (Gdańsk aka 'Danzig' was a majority German city before WWII, but after it became Polish territory in 1945, the surviving German residents were expelled and most German cemeteries were demolished.)

* I don't know if you've ever read 'The Tin Drum' *(Die Blechtrommel)* by Günter Grass, but it's a very famous German book from the 50s about the Nazi period, WWII and the aftermath in Danzig/Gdańsk (among other things, it has a very vivid account of the siege of the Polish Post Office). Grass was born in Danzig and there are a few small monuments to 'The Tin Drum' and a DIY walking tour in Grass's old neighbourhood of Wrzeszcz (a bit north of the city centre).

* Places to hang out: Gdańsk has amazing bars and cafes. My absolute favourites are the cafe-bar **Józef K.** (named after main character of Kafka's *The Trial*) on ul. Piwna and the cafe-bars **Drukarnia** and **Cafe Kamienica** on ul. Mariacka.

* Nearby: the best daytrip from Gdańsk is to **Malbork (Marienburg) Castle**, easily accessible by train. It was the headquarters of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia and is the largest brick castle in Europe. The castle is very impressive and definitely worth the trip.

Between Gdańsk and Warsaw:

* **Toruń** is a beautiful medieval city about halfway between Gdańsk and Warsaw. It's famous for its gingerbread and for being the birthplace of Copernicus. You can buy gingerbread everything there - gingerbread tea, gingerbread beer, gingerbread schnapps... there's also a gingerbread museum where you can make your own gingerbread. There's also a quirky [travellers' museum](https://muzeum.torun.pl/en/tony-halik-explorers-museum/) created by a random travel-obsessed couple featuring, among other things, their collection of stolen hotel keys from around the world.

In and around Warsaw:

* The **Museum of the Polish Jews** - one of Europe's best Jewish museums, rivalling the famous one in Berlin. Be warned, you can be sucked in for several hours here. I went in five hours before closing figuring I'd give it a quick look and ended up running out of time BEFORE EVEN GETTING TO WWII! I'm not even Jewish myself, it's just that fascinating.

* A couple blocks north of the Jewish Museum is the monument at the **Umschlagplatz**, a large waiting area in the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto (which I think was the largest in Europe?) where residents would be packed onto trains and sent off to the death camps. 

* The **Chopin monument** in Łazienki Park. I'm not a statue person and it's not often that a statue makes me stop in awe, but this one is simply incredible. It's so moving. Apparently the location around the statue is also a live concert venue in the summer (I was there in winter), so it's worth checking out.

* The **[City] Museum of Warsaw** in the reconstructed Old Town. City museums are often boring, but not this one. This might be the best city musem I've visited and is certainly the most modern. It tells the story of Warsaw through fascinating infographics and 3D-printed models. One of my favourite exhibits was an infographic timeline of Warsaw's ""firsts"", like first skyscraper, first elevator, first pizzeria (in the late 90s!!!)... it really puts into perspective how fast Warsaw has changed.

* I also strongly recommend a trip to the **National Museum**, which contains the most significant collection of Polish art including one of the most famous Polish paintings of all, the [Battle of Grunwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grunwald_\(Matejko\)#/media/File:Jan_Matejko,_Bitwa_pod_Grunwaldem.jpg) by Jan Matejko... it's a huge painting that takes up an entire wall and must be experienced in person for the full effect. It depicts one of the most famous moments in (medieval) Polish history, the victory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth over the (Prussian) Teutonic Knights at Grunwald (Tannenberg).

* If you haven't seen it already, you should watch *The Pianist*, a film about WWII in Warsaw which also covers the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. Although it was produced in English, it's actually quite historically accurate in its depiction of the relevant historical events and the overall ambiance of German-occupied Warsaw... although I'm far from an expert, I have travelled extensively in Poland and speak some Polish, and as far as I know, it manages to feel quite authentic.

In and around Krakow:

* Obviously the **Kazimierz** neighbourhood, the former Jewish neighbourhood of Krakow, where you can get amazing Zapiekanki (Polish pizza, native to Krakow) around the Okrąglak

* Cross the bank to the south side of the Vistula where you can find the former **Jewish Ghetto** (mostly in the northern part of the neighbourhood now known as Stare Podgórze) - including the memorial at Plac Bohaterów Getta and the museum in the Eagle Pharmacy

* **Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory** - yes, the same one depicted in *Schindler's List*. The former factory is now a museum that tells the real-life story of Oskar Schindler and the 'Schindler Jews', and more broadly the story of the Holocaust in Poland/Krakow.

* The quarry and former concentration camp of **Płaszów**, just south of the ghetto and the Schindler factory. It was the concentration camp famously depicted in *Schindler's List*. Now it's mostly a big field with a few surviving buildings and a partially preserved Jewish cemetery. Although there's not much to 'see' anymore, it's worth walking around and soaking it in.

On Auschwitz: 

* Yes, I recommend going, and going solo. It is an intensely personal experience and IMO it's honestly better to go alone so you can process it on your own time. You can buy a small written guidebook from the information centre for extra context if you want.

* Remember that Auschwitz-Birkenau is actually *two* sites... you will probably start at Auschwitz I, the first camp, which is comprised of several large brick buildings that were largely used to house lesser prisoners and the prison guards/officers. The first site contains most of the formal exhibitions, including some of the most (in)famous displays (the collection of shoes, the collection of glasses, the book of names) and exhibitions on the deportations in each individual European country. So the first camp has most of the 'information'. But pace yourself and be prepared, because...

* The second site of Auschwitz (Auschwitz II, aka 'Birkenau'), which you access via shuttle bus from the first site, is what most people think of when they think of 'Auschwitz'. The 'Arbeit Macht Frei' sign, the train tracks through the imposing brick gate, the gas chambers, the extermination camp. It is a huge site (much of which has been destroyed) with some surviving exhibitions... you can still see the ruins of the gas chambers, some of the barracks, the toilets, the assembly area etc... it is probably the most emotionally upsetting part of the visit.

* It's OK to take breaks. It is YOUR visit and you can process it as you need to. If that means finding a quiet area to lie down for a while and process your feelings, so be it. If you feel like you need a hot chocolate from the information centre afterwards - go ahead. Just take it at your own pace.",1629995109,hafwjs4,t3_pbspsu,/r/solotravel/comments/pbspsu/hidden_gems_in_poland/hafwjs4/,5,solotravel

loqqui,t2_4lo3usy8,"Finding a language school in the region of interest is probably a good way. A lot of study abroad programs (at least from my USA uni) have language courses built into the class, so this would be a close equivalent of a study abroad. The ""study"" in study abroad is usually in relation to culture and language from my understanding. Language schools would also be a good way to meet people, and also increase your ability to interact more deeply with your environment while you are on your extended stay.  


If you are looking for more deep/academically rooting ""study"" experiences that actually teach you more in depth things like detailed history, etc. I personally don't have many ideas aside from specialized tour guides.

deliveryboyman,t2_4ac62,"While Slovenia is a beautiful country it's also rather small. For me three weeks would be too long, I'd definitely try to add a week of Italy or Croatia to your itinerary and cut back on some of your stops.

Ljubljana is nice, but in 2-3 days you'll have seen pretty much everything there is to see. Your time for Bled/Triglav/Soca valley seems good, just be aware that it can get pretty cold there in late October. Also from Piran to Celje it's like a two hour drive, so I don't see the need for a stopover in Ljubljana. On the way there you can stop at Trojane for some Krofi. 
4 days in the wine country and Maribor also seem a little long to me. Maribor back to Ljubljana is another two hour drive so depending on when your flight leaves you could just drive back on the same day. Or you could head directly to Bled on your first day and spend 3 days in Ljubljana at the end of your trip.

Regarding COVID I'd recommend that you request a formal vaccination document. Right now numbers are still on the lower side and to be honest barely anyone checks your vaccination status (at least here in Austria), but I think that will change once the numbers start climbing.

dmartin1500,t2_4rpdw5sn,"I'm honestly in the same boat - I never got to experience a semester abroad due to cross country/track and financial constraints (I was lucky to even afford school in the first place).

Two factors seemed to define the experience for my friends:  the amount of time largely spent in one place and the camaraderie of the other students in the program.

For the first factor, it's fairly simple.  Find a home base abroad from which to digital nomad for a few months.  Take weekend trips but largely stay put and get a deep experience in your city/neighborhood.  This kind of flies in the face of normal solo travel, as typically you're on the road after a few days somewhere (at least I know I am).  It can be a rich experience though, as I've done this with Taipei myself.

The second factor is much harder to replicate, to be honest.  It will take some work and probably not be the same, but you can certainly try your best.  You can kind of do it by doing things like yacht weeks, Contiki, etc., but even those are only days/weeks rather than months and usually have you moving around a lot.  I have had some success joining a local club or group, but that can also be very hard with a language barrier.  Running or sports clubs have worked for me, as it doesn't require me to talk much and can still have some camaraderie with people who can speak some English.

on the friends/roots part, that's just the way it is dude! can't have your cake and eat it too. just accept that. however, i will say that a lot of friendships STILL fall apart even if you stay right where you are. and the likelihood is, you'll make more likeminded friends when you do the things you wanna do.

Tamarindo is great for surfing especially if you're a beginner.

I'd recommend staying in hostels if your goal is to meet people.

Also October is not a great time to go because that's peak rainy season and it rains literally all day everyday in October.

Don't forget to pack bug cream/spray and sunscreen. And make sure to have a rain jacket.

Get comfortable with traveling to other countries on your first solo trip and then you become unstoppable. I have been to 80 countries already with this mentality. Then you realize that you don't need to plan any certain time in any certain place, you just go with the flow and stay longer in places you like and less in places you don't. Figure out what travel style works for you but if you have such a wide range of time, don't get bogged down on planning so much ahead because the minute you meet someone you vibe with, your plans can completely change.

db1139,t2_3h59pan2,"Go for NY, Chicago, or DC.

I'm least familiar with Chicago, but I live in NY and I've spent a ton of time in DC. For museums, I think DC is a bit better than NY, depending on what you want to see and the hotels should be cheaper. 

The hotel might really take too much of your budget for NY. If you do go for NY, you could try to stay in a decent section of Brooklyn, Queens, or NJ and then take the train in, but the hotel could still add up. I advise putting in some research. You don't want to stay in the hood. Also, download citymaper. People are often confused by the subway and it'll help. The busses in NY are also super underrated and cleaner than the subway. 

Look up which museums are technically free. Like the Natural History Museum in NY is technically free. The ticket price is a donation (at least it was the last time I went).

If you want museums and attractions, NY or DC. Portland isn't somewhere you can get around and New Orleans simply pales in comparison to the other two for what it seems you're looking for. I have been and I have friends who went to college there. NY has the best food out of your options, but definitely most expensive. Look up inexpensive restaurants wherever you end up going.

If you have other questions, I might be able to answer some. I've traveled extensively in the US, but I haven't taken public transit in every city. That said, you might want to look up Boston as well. Personally, I'd go DC because I think you'll have the museums and it's less expensive than NY. If going for NY, maybe shorten your trip to 7-8 days. You'll be able to hit most of the big places to see in that time and you'll be able to afford more.

Feel free to ask any questions about NY. I've done pretty much everything here at least 3 times.",1629810931,ha5p4k1,t3_pachxg,/r/solotravel/comments/pachxg/solo_first_time_traveler_looking_for_travel/ha5p4k1/,1,solotravel

My advice? Drive to IAD and fly United. They have a nonstop flight to Honolulu from Dulles. If the nonstop is too expensive, book a connecting flight on United and wait for the schedule to change. If the departure or arrival time changes by more than an hour or two, there’s a good chance you can get United to move you to the nonstop free of charge.

mbjb1972,t2_bmngt,"As a Torontonian who lived in Chicago and been to the other cities multiple times,  I can give you the perspective of someone who loves Toronto. 

If  you are looking for quaint with access to amazing natural environs go to Portland.  The city isn’t going to blow your mind with live music or anything like that but there are great Resto options and there is an artsy scene. 

New York is a must for anyone because it is so impressive in every way.   Can’t even write a lot more. Love this city so much.  My opinion is it is the Alpha city of all still. 

New Orleans feels like a different world, and if you are into Cajun food, zydeco music, jazz, colonial style architecture and blazing heat and humidity go for NOLA.  

Chicago has great architecture, lots of great restos, a blues and electronic scene and lots of bands come through at the Metro, Chicago theatre etc. There are so many great neighbourhoods to check out but you will be shocked at how homogenous it is and the total despair that exists for a lot of people. The few ethnic groups will shock you coming from Toronto. The El gets you around well, but Chicago is a different beast. Now a little smaller than Toronto, but 10x bigger in crime, street crime, etc even on Michigan Ave. Navy Pier is a definite pass, the art institute is world class, grant park is cool downtown and an effective use of public space. It is very EASY to make the wrong turn here and you stick out when you do it. In three years I was robbed at gun point once, knife point once and a buddy of mine was mobbed recently on State street in the loop for a phone. Tough city. Beautiful city and a dying city in some respects. Larger swaths of land west of the loop are showing vacancies and at least one hospital I know of has been converted to a hospital specifically for gun shot victims. I love the city and am blown away at how similar and how absolutely polar opposite Chicago and toronto are. 

Washington DC is one of my favourite US cities. Walkable, incredible museums, groovy architecture everywhere and for sure safer than it once was but so so vibrant. Maybe the most under rated city I can think of because of all the political baggage it brings. 

My other favourites are:
Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and in Canada Vancouver. 

Depending where you have been and where my opinions come from I can throw at you some other thoughts: I also like Winnipeg and Hamilton for the gritty urban vibes. I loathe with all my heart Calgary and Edmonton who have based their cities on the worst aspects of big American cities. I think Halifax while friendly is over rated and mind numbingly boring.",1629818214,ha65e2q,t3_pachxg,/r/solotravel/comments/pachxg/solo_first_time_traveler_looking_for_travel/ha65e2q/,2,solotravel

Wasn’t the most fun I’ve ever had, but music, and math helped me stay up along with the caffeine and nicotine. If I didn’t have music I would calculate how long it would take for me to get to my next stop and if the GPS was accurate, or how fast the GPS predicted I’d be driving (things like that). Idk why but that kinda stuff amuses me and keeps my mind stimulated. It really made me appreciate how close people/places I’d like to visit are and makes me think, “woah, this place is only 2-3 hrs away I wouldn’t mind driving there.” But if you really don’t want to do the drive solo, I’m pretty sure there’s an app out there that connects people who need a travel companion.

2) how much do you pack, would a single carryon and a backpack with about 5 days of clothes (assuming I take a chill day to do laundry mid way) be enough?

3) what do you pack?

4) what is the process like for getting visas as a US citizen?

If you do want to go to Bruges, I'd do it on a separate day. Doing the two cities in one day is going to be a very rushed day. Bruges is pretty but it is more of a tourist trap than Ghent is and therefore also probably more expensive and more crowded.

AStandAloneComplex,t2_7e1ll0kl,"Also from the American SouthWest, and my girlfriend from New Mexico just visited for over a week and we did this itinerary. I live in the Netherlands for reference on perspective. 

1. For such a short trip although I love Ghent, I would cut it out for another day in Paris. Not even one full day including traveling in and out of the city isn’t worth it in my opinion.

2. The food in the Netherlands is atrocious. I’ve eaten at little cafes all the way up to 100euro/plate fine dining in Amsterdam and I’ve never eaten somewhere I would return to since I moved to the Netherlands. So be prepared for that. I live near Amsterdam and love visiting the city to walk around the cute streets and spend time with friends though. You’ll enjoy yourself enough out of the new atmosphere and experience alone. You’ll enjoy the museums, they are very nice and worth the time invested I think.

3.Paris has everything you want and more. The architecture is stunning. The food in literally any cafe you walk into is incredible. I recommend you Uber over and have dinner starting at 7 at Le Petit Marche. The museums are hyped up for good reason. The French do everything right and are much kinder than stereotypes lead Americans to believe. 

Last thing I would add is if you must go, knock out the touristy places quick so you can get on to the real Paris. They are cool for a minute or two and then you go “welp I saw it?”

As far as day trips, you can totally avoid making a separate trip to Ghent and instead take a day trip to Bruges from Paris. Bruges is a place I think about randomly out of nowhere because it was such a special place when I was there for half a day over a decade ago. That will take care of your Belgium fix, but honestly it’s almost humanly impossible to not be satisfied by Bruges except to regret not staying longer.

Figured I’ll post this here then do that way if someone has better info or more knowledge with Europe they can chime in. Regarding your anxiety the sidebar has a really helpful mental health tab that I’d recommend giving a read. It’s helped me out when I did a lot of my solo US trips and thought it would magically cure me of my anxiety and damn I got dumped let’s run away to hawaii cause that fixes everything. 

1. super loose budget for ya cause of Covid I haven’t made a lot of reservations in case something goes wrong I don’t have to cancel as many things. Budget wise I have about $950 roughly planned for the trip, not including airfare assuming $300 for lodging (hostels for 7 nights at avg $40 a piece), $300 for my train tickets (1 round trip to Versailles, 1 way to gent, 1 way to Amsterdam), museums, sight seeing excursions, and then $350 for my food. I know, that’s a lot for food,  but I really really love food and find it to be one of the defining and best parts of a culture and will gladly invest money into great meal experiences. You can adjust your budget depending on what works for you and what your goals are. Don’t care so much for food? Then you can grocery shop and find hostels or Airbnb’s with kitchens. Or focus on local events for cheaper options then expensive museums. 

2. My plan is to one bag the whole trip with my Osprey Kyte 46, is it a bit big, absolutely but Im a sucker for shopping in other countries/cities so I might bring home a few extra pieces. I’ll also have a small purse for day trips and going out. Check out the subs r/onebag and r/heronebag they’ll have some awesome resources for you if you’re into minimalist packing and not into bringing a large suitcase

3. Same things you would pack for any other week long trip with the exceptions of some intercontinental items like converters, passport, copies of travel documents. Reference the one bag subs above for awesome packing list suggestions. 

4. As a US citizen, the schengen/ EU countries don’t require you to have a visa to visit! Visas play a role if you’re planning to stay for longer then 90 days but that’s the EU and every country is different but check out the US embassy website for what countries you want to go to and they’ll give you all the info you need to know! It’s a great resource and knowing where the us embassy is very helpful for you as a traveler!

Definitely book the Louvre in advance if you want to go, I'm not sure about the Arc de Triomphe. 

Somebody else already recommended it but the Montmartre area is great to walk around. We also have lots of parks to chill in (Tuileries but also Luxembourg or Buttes Chaumont), and the quais de Seine are always nice to walk on, you can see lots of landmarks from there.

lookthepenguins,t2_6jehkbz0,"I'm female, around the central Amsterdam area at night was never too worried walking around alone up to midnight, even through the redlight district.  Not so much after midnight, it starts getting very seedy indeed.

Often some dude will call out or try to make conversation - do not engage do not break stride, either ignore them completely or smile say politely NO THANKYOU and KEEP WALKING confidently.  They have various bait to get you to stop, or talk with them - ""tell me what's the time?"" , ""where is blabla?"" , ""let's have a beer?"", wtf ever - do not fall for it, smile with LOL all over your face, and keep walking.   If you get nervous, veer back into heavily crowded area.  Most of the central area has lot of people wandering around till at least midnight-ish along the more major streets.

Paris, plenty people around on the streets till 9 - 10ish at least, especially in the major areas eg Champs-Élysées Moulin Rouge etc, and the Metro at least the major lines, &amp; stations nearer the centre.  I often took Metro home alone just me, till up to midnight even.  I sure didn't live in a seedy ghetto area, but neither was it posh.

Mind you, post-plague, I'd be a bit more wary of pick-pockets &amp; tourist-scammers.  In Paris, also.  I hear lot of pickpocketing in Paris these days more than before even, especially in Metro.  No fear no paranoia, they don't have guns like in USA eh.  Everywhere in Europe, Keep your daypack / handbag on your FRONT, hanging onto it at all times.

No clue on how long. Friends recently went to various museums in Amsterdam. Apparently you now have to book your entrance time in advance.

opheliazzz,t2_9kmofhoo,"I love love love both Gent and Brugge, they are within easy distance from each other (30 mins by train). Just keep in mind that trains do not run after midnight, otherwise there are good connections throughout the day.

If you go to Gent, I sincerely recommend you to have the local stew called Waterzooi, the best place imo to have it, is at 't Vosken next to the cathedral.

Taking the boat tour through the canals is a great way to explore both cities. There's guided tours in English, ask about the times at the local tourist office or at your hostel. But they're very easy to find in the centres of both towns.

If you are 26 yo oryounger, you can take any train to the border for 6 eur, you can buy a special pass for 1 or 10 tickets at any train station or even at the ticket machine.

A lot of what's interesting about Montreal is unfortunately not at full steam because of COVID -- many things are shut down, running at lower capacity, festivals gone virtual, etc. I say this not to put you off, but to warn you that if you come here expecting the same feeling as you had in 2019, you may find the difference jarring.

Note also that our vaccine passport to access restaurants, bars, concert halls, etc. goes into effect on Sept 1st, and it's still unclear as to how this will apply to tourists. Note that while you as a fully vaccinated American can travel to Canada, you have to submit your info in advance on ArriveCAN and take a PCR test prior; check [here](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid) for travel info. Also please note that while Americans can come here, fully vaccinated Canadians are still barred indefinitely from crossing the land border into the US, so a lot of people are angry about that and are pushing for the border to be re-closed to Americans. 

Also, our Delta variant case numbers are going up sharply, and kids are about to go back to school next week (so far with no masks, which is just so idiotic I can't even begin...) so please be careful.

In terms of things to see and do, what kind of things are you interested in?

The 29th is also the annual [Tour de l'Ile](https://www.velo.qc.ca/evenement/tour-ile-montreal/classique/) cycling festival, so many streets around the city will be closed for the bike ride. Sunday afternoons there are the tam-tams at the base of Mount Royal (though do be cautious; masks are unfortunately rare in these crowds).

On my most recent Europe trip (just got back) I went with a pair of Brooks Ghost and a pair of decent-looking Clarks.

On my recent trip I only made the first couple of nights of hotel reservations and winged it.  I did fine, as tourist numbers are way down and there were always deals to be had.  Stayed in nicer hotels than usual because of the low prices.  Be sure to research the EU green pass before you go.  You likely will still need one.

PK-418,t2_a4mfopwu,"My recommendation, do not stay in Amsterdam. Stay in Utrecht, Rotterdam, Leiden or Haarlem. Amsterdam is over priced and so flooded by tourists that it’s turned the entire city to shit. Utrecht, Leiden and Haarlem are all cheaper and prettier with great  traditional old dutch architecture. Rotterdam is an amazing place to explore the modern side of the country. All cities are very accessible by train so you can stay in one and do daytrips to the other cities including Amsterdam if you want to see the van Gogh. To see the tulips you have to visit the Netherlands in the spring. You could go to visit the Keukenhof. There they turn the flower beds into giant art pieces. It is a cheesy tourist attraction, but even the dutch themselves enjoy it as a day out. So to conclude I would take 4 days. Day 1:Haarlem/Leiden/Utrecht, day 2: Rotterdam, Day 3: Keukenhof, day 4: Van Gogh in Amsterdam",1629645369,h9x1eud,t3_p9207f,/r/solotravel/comments/p9207f/first_solo_trip_to_europe_8_days_paris_ghent/h9x1eud/,1,solotravel

notyetwoozy,t2_7hveyzkl,"I've never been to Amsterdam, but have spent lots of time in Paris and did a trip a few years back to Brussels&gt;Ghent&gt;Bruges. 

I think Ghent is totally the right choice over Bruges, and definitely both are better than Brussels. It's been said here, but reiterating that Hostel Uppelink in Ghent is amazing. Another favorite spot was Hot Club Jazz if you have any interest in or even patience for jazz, it's good to do as a solo person (easy nightlife without any ""everyone knows I'm here by myself"" spotlight feeling, in case that's a thing for you; it has been for me sometimes). Again, I can't speak to Amsterdam but I kind of wish you had more than just one day in Ghent, especially after coming from the bustle of Paris. 

As for Paris, do you know where in the city you're staying? I think not having a strict itinerary is great, but maybe think about a couple of things you'd really want to make sure you see and check off your list, and then make a plan for those, especially for Paris. It's a huge city, like London, so wandering the city and shops and cafes are a bit better in some areas than others, but I think just wandering and walking around is the absolute right way to go. It's a beautiful city from the streets. Be aware that August is a popular month for locals to leave Paris to vacation in the south so restaurants might be more closed down than usual. Le Marais, Montmartre and Bastille are great areas for wandering and getting classic Paris vibes, Canal Saint Martin / Canal du L'Ourcq are my favorites for young hip things and people. Favorite spots for hanging out, people watching, sipping coffee or beer and eating food include Le Pavillion des Canaux, Shakespeare and Company and it's little cafe. Everyone has said baguettes, and yes baguettes are amazing, but you also need to do crepes, both a sweet crepe and a savory crepe. My favorite spot when I did my semester abroad in Paris was a little Creperie called Creperie Genia, which had an affordable ""formule"" where you could get a savory crepe (I would usually do egg, cheese, and ham) plus a sweet crepe (my favorite is the plain old crepe au nutella but people also love crepe nutella banane with banana) and a drink for a few euro. It's not far from Shakespeare and Co. The view from the top of the Arc de Triomphe is worth it. The Champs Elysee can feel like an overly busy shopping street because it is an overly busy shopping street, and I mean like H&amp;M and Louis Vuitton. The Louvre is fine, but it's so overwhelmingly huge and crowded, my favorite museums are the Atelier des Lumiere for a modern take (so cool), Musee d'Orsay for the classics, and Jeu de Paume if you're into photography at all.

3 places that come to mind are:

- The leaning tower of Pisa. It's cool to see in person, but you don't nees long there. It's packed full of people most of the day, and just a tourist trap.

- Chichen Itza. This may be because I took a tour there (so arrived with all the other buses and was a very long day). But having so many vendors all through the place hassling you was just irritating. 

- Angkor Wat Sunrise. Don't get me wrong - it's an experience you kind of have to do, but trying to get to the reflecting pool before the hundreds of other people, all being packed together, swatting mosquitoes every few seconds kind of ruins the experience.

gypsyblue,t2_4xoqe,"If your main priority is to practice your language skills, I would recommend not choosing Berlin. I say this as a Berliner myself. English is so widespread in the city (to the extent that service staff in many 'hip' restaurants/cafes don't even speak German) that it can be hard to actually practice your German.

I came here as an international student in an English-speaking Masters program. Almost all my international classmates said at the beginning of the program that they wanted to learn German. By the end of the two years, very few actually did. It's just too easy to fall back on English.

Hamburg and Munich are both good options, but if you really want to maximise your language practice, I would suggest going for a smaller city, especially in the east... like Dresden or Leipzig. There are also some very nice smaller cities in Bavaria with access to great hiking and outdoor activities, like Regensburg or Passau.",1629542094,h9rwfl6,t3_p8oeh1,/r/solotravel/comments/p8oeh1/upcoming_germanyaustria_trip_for_1_month_october/h9rwfl6/,8,solotravel

I'm not a fan of going somewhere standing with a large group of people and taking picture of a famous sight from the parking lot. I love doing day hiking trips by myself and found that you couldn't really do that in Iceland. I was solo traveling without a car so that contributed to it.  
One trip I did do was in Akureyri where there's a small hut called Lambi I believe and a nearby mountain Sulur which was nice. But overall I found myself hiking along roads and across bridges where you really shouldn't walk. The nonexistent public transport meant that you would have to hike back, where as in other places I've done hikes and than taken the bus back to my starting point.

Usually there is a handful of things I really, really want to see/experience in each place (likely the reason that city was on my radar in the first place), and then there are the things that would be nice, but not necessarily something I'd be heartbroken to miss if I couldn't get there.

I'll set up a rough itinerary either on paper or in my head, and research the best way of making the pieces fit, but if I get there and the weather is awful, or the transport connections are too hard to make work, I unexpectedly find something else I'm really excited about, or even that I'm just not feeling it on a particular day, then that's ok too. 

It's MY holiday, and MY experience, so I'm free to do it any way I want. If that means I get out of bed before sunrise and wander the streets in the rain taking photos, then go to the markets and have a fresh cooked breakfast, or sleep in until midday, grab some fast food and then relax indoors all afternoon, that's fine.

If you do both, the ferry ride between Split and Dubrovnik is awesome - just get there early to get a window seat.   Other problem we had in Croatia is that some of cabs have Uber accounts and will accept your fare - when they’re just out of sight, they’ll cancel Uber and then drive by and “check on you.”  Cabs fares when we were there were about double Uber rates.

I explored AZ first about 8 years ago. 

I had more time than most and so explored most of the state. Hiking and biking, including thousands of miles of overnight bicycle trips.

I ended up finding myself wanting to spend more time in the Tucson area in the end.

The culture, variety of terrain, cost of living and other factors made me want to come back and after another couple visits I ended up moving there.

Phoenix is a mass of suburban sprawl. You always have to drive long distances in traffic to go anywhere. It can also be a relatively expensive place to visit compared to other places in AZ.

Adventurous_Tone_273,t2_3xwod43u,"Hey! I’ve been traveling around Croatia for almost three months. To be honest, I think packing so many cities in will be a bit stressful and you won’t get to see each one properly. And like someone said, the cities are quite far from each other so you need to account for travel days. I would probably recommend cutting Zadar and maybe instead staying near Plitvice and focusing on that. I did Krka and it was nice but I think if you’re seeing Plitvice, that park is supposed to be bigger and better than Krka. The tours to Krka from Split are very quick so you don’t get to see too much of the park. Maybe that’s a day you could allocate to one of the other cities instead of Krka. Split is great, Dubrovnik is great. I didn’t see Zagreb since it’s so far so I chose to focus on southern Croatia and save northern Croatia for a separate trip.

glitterlok,t2_2aa6i,"These kinds of things are very personal, so obviously YMMV, but...

Rome blew my mind. I've been hearing great things about it my entire life, but never had much interest myself. Then a few months ago I finally decided to go, and I was nearly in shock for the first few days there. It was just *so fucking lovely*.

Similarly, Japan totally lived up to the hype for me (depending on what you think the hype about Japan is). I became totally enamored with it by the time I left, even though the trip was a bit of a lark (a cheap flight popped up, so I took it).

India...is both, I think. I had romanticized it prior to visiting, and that's always a bad idea. The reality of India was a slap in the face of that mindset, and there was a lot of disillusionment that had to occur. But once that faded, I started understanding the language other people use to describe it (vibrant, full of life, diverse, rich) in a more appropriate way, and it totally delivered on those ideas.

A lot of the Caribbean islands fell on the ""disappointing"" side of the spectrum for me in the moment, but that's mainly because of the expectations I had going in.

Domino Park by the water is new, will find folks there sunbathing, reading, or drinking. Brooklyn botanical in prospect park is beautiful, but might be a pain to get to from bushwick. Red hook has an amazing bbq place called Hometown bar-b-que. There’s also distilleries and lobster joints there, and a delicious key lime pie shop. The Brooklyn mirage is great if their music is your jam. 

For more garden type stuff, the NY botanical in the Bronx is very nice as well but also a bit of a trek from bushwick. The High Line in Manhattan is a great example of an urban garden, and has drawn international admiration. Might be crowded, or not due to the nature of the times.

I'm finally planning my overseas travelling again after all this years/months :).

Here is my current plan at the moment :  
  
flew to warsaw  
  
take train to krakow  
  
train to bratishlava (Slovakia) &gt;&gt;&gt; is it worth to go ? need some advice !  
  
maybeee vienna  
  
maybeee Prague  
  
maybeee berlin  
  
Wroclaw ???  
  
Gdansk ???  
  
back to warsaw  
  
I'm thinking of taking train to go around, but I'm up for another suggestion if there is more efficient/effective way to travel like bus/plane.  
  
Haven't really decided on the length of the trip might be \~2 weeks in end of Sept - early Oct, I'm from Canada btw.

Hi! I’m thinking about traveling to Lisbon next week but with COVID and restrictions, I was wondering if there are any Americans who are willing to share their recent experience visiting Portugal. I know hotels and some restaurants are requiring a negative Covid test in order to be accommodated. Was it difficult to get these tests? Are there any other restrictions or requirements that people should be aware of? A negative Covid test is also required before departing. Did you find it easy or difficult finding a test that was valid for US entry (as well as affordable)? Any information you could share would be helpful. Also did you have a stopover/layover on your way there? My trip has a 2 hour layover in France. I don’t think this would disrupt my chances of entry, but would like to know how your journey to Portugal was if you didn’t fly direct. 

Also if you can please let me know from your experience whether you feel going at this time is worth it, I’d love to hear your opinion.

segacs2,t2_gxfcx,"IDK, hosting people from around the world just seems like a bad idea in the middle of a pandemic. But owning your own place will more easily allow you to do what you want, vs. renting, especially if it's a single family home or standalone place vs. a condo. Not so affordable these days, and most single family homes are in the suburbs where travellers won't want to stay, so YMMV.

In some cities, there are increased restrictions on AirBNB sites where you rent out your place for cash, because of their impact on housing costs, gentrification, etc. If you just plan to host couchsurfers while you're around, that's likely fine as it's the same as having guests. But a private guest bedroom would probably make people feel better about staying with you.

Just a note: This may not be fair, but if you're a single dude, you probably won't get a lot of women willing to stay with you.

ccccccml,t2_dn7l8q8o,"Hi!
I was just in Istanbul with my best friend. We are both females in our twenties. 
We stayed at a cute little Airbnb in Sultanahmet and I couldn’t recommend it more to stay in that area. There are also very nice and cheap hotels that you can stay at! It is a very touristy area close to the mosques and close to the sea as well. There are boat tours that leave from Sultanahmet (we did one).  The area is very safe IMO. My and my friend regularly stayed out late into the night and walked back to our Airbnb with no trouble whatsoever. 
If you are going to take taxis, make sure the meter is running from 5.5 TL and that you can pull up the address to where you are going. Most taxi drivers will speak little to no English so having google translate is a must. I’d learn basic Turkish greetings as well… I realized that when they hear you trying to speak their language they become 100x friendlier!!
Sultanahmet also has a couple of taxi stations where you can go to call a taxi so that’s also a perk of staying there. 

I can’t speak for Taksim as I didn’t get a chance to go; but a friend I made in Turkey told me to be careful when you go there. It is sort of touristy but there are some dangerous streets at night.",1629269189,h9dt0jb,t3_p6ay6x,/r/solotravel/comments/p6ay6x/solo_female_in_istanbul_from_malta/h9dt0jb/,3,solotravel

gypsyblue,t2_4xoqe,"It sounds like she might just be really burnt out from her job and wanted a more slow-paced, relaxing trip than the one that you wanted. An all-inclusive resort or tour package where she wasn't expected to contribute to the planning or make many decisions might have been the better choice for her. It's not a bad thing, it's just that you evidently had very different goals for the trip.

You can be great friends with someone, even best friends, and just not be compatible travel partners. It happens. I love my best friend to death, but travelling with her drives me crazy. She's a late riser and travels at a much slower pace than I do. So we usually don't travel together, or if we do, it's for something like a concert or event, or to some place I've been before, where it's easier to bring our travel styles in sync.

Usually if I'm travelling with a friend and realise we're not travel compatible, I'll suggest just splitting up for the day, or doing things together in the morning and then apart in the afternoon. This is harder or impossible though on a car-based trip where you're both dependent on the same transportation.

pulledporksdwch,t2_2xs8wsbh,"I did an ""Adventure Tour"" when I was there. It literally had horseback riding, zip lining (which was stunningly beautiful), white-water tubing, and the day finished at a volcanic mud bath and hot spring. It was a really fun experience! The tour company picked me up at the hotel and did all the driving, and I lucked out because he didn't have any other passengers. So I was solo for all the transportation. There were about 70 people doing it all together, but they broke us down into smaller groups for each activity. 

I've said this before in other comments about CR, but Hacienda Alsacia, the Starbucks Coffee Farm, was a really amazing experience. Very educational and informative, and it completely changed my outlook on the company to a positive view. It was about 30 minutes from San Jose, and even if you don't want to do the tour, I'd highly recommend at least going for the cafe. Open concept, with the cafe literally jutting out over the valley. Waterfall off to the side. Oversized lounge chairs. That view was breathtaking. Most relaxing cup of coffee I've ever had. 

I did spend the last part of my trip relaxing on a beach in the Guanacaste area, and fell in love with that part of the country. Even if you're not a beach person, it was still beautiful to see. The place I stayed at was a resort, and I splurged on myself to be there. Not my typical choice, but after a bad experience at another hotel, it was incredible. Definitely had plenty of unique food and drink options (both were amazing!). They even had kayak and stand-up paddle boards for rent. Seemed much more relaxed and laid-back up there, so if you want a change of pace, definitely make time for it. 

I hope you enjoy your trip! It's a great and welcoming country with plenty to see. As far as food goes... whatever you do, find some fresh gazpacho.

AtreyuThai,t2_3toxp3o5,"I was in NYC for 4 solo days and tried to pack in as much as possible.  Must see places for me were the 9/11 Memorial Museum, Empire State building,  Statue of Liberty, Times Square and Madison Square Garden (I did the tour and also saw a concert).  

When I arrived I took a double decker bus tour from Times Square and it went all over the city,  this was a great way to cover a bunch of ground easily.  I remember going across the Brooklyn bridge on the bus tour and the driver pointing out a legendary pizza place but I forget the name? I wish I walked back there from Manhattan, across the Brooklyn bridge and had this pizza which I believe was one of the pioneer pizza restaurants in the area. Many, many tourists walk the Brooklyn bridge,  I just ran out of time. I remember driving past Jay-Z's high school and the tour operator pointing it out.  Lots of great memories.

Upon my arrival and asking around everyone told me to see a Broadway musical which may be difficult now but is definitely a bucket list item.  I saw The Book of Mormon and bought tickets from the theatre it was playing at, directly and last minute as they were heavily discounted, excellent seats.  I'm not sure if Broadway is running again but if you get the chance please see a musical,  it was truly incredible!!

Another surprise was these multi ticket packs for various attractions that were discounted and I ended up seeing the MoMA and 30 Rock building as a result of this.  Admittedly I rushed through the MoMA but I did get to take a quick walk in central park while I was there.  

I'm doubtful I'll ever make it back to NYC but I would definitely want to explore Williamsburg! I would also make a point to visit Yankee Stadium.

sleepy55,t2_6z6m4,"You’re only going to be there for 2 days so you should tailor your list a bit to make sure you can actually fit everything in. NYC is bigger than people expect.

I would recommend: 

1) Take the **FREE** Staten Island ferry (don’t approach or interact with the scammers/salesmen who approach you in lower Manhattan trying to sell Statue of Liberty cruises or make you pay for the SI ferry). I would recommend it for anyone visiting. It’s a quick 30 minute ride and you get really great views of the Statute of Liberty and lower Manhattan. 
2) Brooklyn Museum OR the Met. I would only recommend doing both if you really like museums due to your time constraints. 
3) Walk over the Brooklyn Bridge
3) The best pizza place in Dumbo (and one of the best in the city) is Juliana’s. Don’t go to the place next door called Grimaldi’s. It’s super overrated. 
4) Take a bike ride around Central Park. It’s 6 miles and you can buy a day pass for a Citi Bike for $15 that gives you unlimited 30 minutes rides for the day. 

This is just off the top of my head but one of your days could look like this:

Take the subway to Battery Park. Walk around the park a bit. Take the SI ferry for the views. Optional: Stop for lunch in SI near the ferry. Take the ferry back to Manhattan and walk through the 9/11 memorial plaza and check out the new freedom tower. You can do the 9/11 museum if you think it would be interesting. Take the subway uptown to Central Park and do a loop of the park on a bike. Optional: go to the Met. Optional: go to 30 Rock for the Top of the Rock for a cool view of midtown and the Empire State Building. Take the subway back downtown. Walk around Wall Street and walk back over the Brooklyn bridge to Dumbo. Have dinner at Juliana’s.",1629305540,h9fe87z,t3_p6s1rg,/r/solotravel/comments/p6s1rg/solo_young_adult_female_going_to_brooklyn_nyc/h9fe87z/,1,solotravel

LadyLandfair,t2_5x1qubn7,"For me the setting has a lot to do with what I’m open to. I solo travel mostly because I prefer to be on my own. However, if I’m on a tour, or at a bar or something, I consider it to be a group experience which includes interacting with fellow travelers. Otherwise I’m open to chit chatting here and there, but I’m not the type of person to suddenly go somewhere or do something with people I just met. I know lots of others are so I’m not put off when it comes up, I just say no thanks and move on. 

I also know there are lots of people, young people it seems for the most part, who have no qualms about sharing all their personal information- where they are staying, their phone numbers, etc. I’m typically more cautious about these things, especially as a solo female traveler, but I admit to some envy of the connections they cultivate from that style.

Do yourself a favor though and find the popular self drive routes.   Kenya for example has tons of people with their own vehicles.   The thing that I think made Namibia different though was that they were using more simple pop ups.

I'm not an expert on the road trip route from Cape Town to Winhoek, but that doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Driving in Africa there is a whole lot of nothing for long stretches, and I imagine that more exaggerated in Southern Namibia. The main highway in Namibia is well maintained from what I saw, but the side roads can be challenging to travel. I would recommend flying to Winhoek and booking group tours from a hostel.

butterballsgalore,t2_6uuud,"The comments here are laughable. I just finished 5 weeks in South Africa and drove over 2500km in 2 different rental cars. Take basic precautions, be sensible, and you'll be fine. Avoid driving at night, and just make sure you go over your planned route of travel beforehand. Google maps will sometimes take you through lesser traveled roads as the fastest route which may not have the best quality. Stick to toll routes when possible. The tolls are inexpensive and the road quality is excellent. 

South African drivers are very friendly and accommodating, and much better than virtually anywhere else on the African continent. I had a flat tire on the motorway outside Durban and 2 gentlemen in a lorry stopped within minutes to lend a hand. ""We are all brothers in this world"", they said.

Cape Town is incredibly beautiful and although the crime rate is high, it's mostly centred around the gang activity in the city. Again, take basic precautions and you'll be fine.

I come from a really hectic lifestyle which makes it hard to keep in touch with my current social circles as it is. In true introvert fashion the reason I solotravel is to get away from it all and wrap myself in quiet solitude so I can recharge. And forming new friendships abroad has never been a goal, because chances are I'm not going to be able to keep in touch with them upon returning home, my existing friends reserve that priority. The idea of sharing plans (esp with men, mostly for safety reasons) is also unappealing to me because one of the highlight of solotravel is to do whatever the fuck I want.

Are there any countries where you can travel visa-free? I'd recommend doing those first before going to any country that requires a visa.

Before the pandemic, obtaining a visa from SEA countries is probably far, *far* easier compared to obtaining a visa from the US. Yes, it's multiple countries, but your chances of getting approved are much higher. We're not as fussy about who gets to visit us.

That said, if your passport is empty, avoid Singapore and Hong Kong until you've got a few countries under your belt. Their immigration is notoriously strict and have been known to deny entry if your passport is empty.

When are you travelling? SEA is really not recommended right now due to the delta variant (I'm speaking as someone who lives in SEA. Covid really bad here and our hospitals are overwhelmed.

Darthlentils,t2_u6onm,"OP, you should mention which passport you hold, that's super relevant to the conversation.

From looking at your profile, I'm assuming you are from Algeria. A quick Google research shows me that **Indonesia** and **Malaysia** have visa-free travel for Algerian. For me it's a no brainer. If you think it's gonna be difficult to get SEA visas, I'd expect the US visa to be much harder, and I doubt you'd get one for 3 months.

I have been to Malaysia and it's a fantastic country. People speak English, it's modern, there's a fascinating mix of culture, so much fantastic nature, you can go to Borneo see orang-utans, hornbills, turtles, learn to dive on beautiful coral reef, and food is great. I have not been to Indonesia but this is a place I'd love to visit.

The US is an amazing destination, but I assume getting a visa will be super tough for you. It's also way more expensive, and I don't personally think it's actually safer than somewhere like Malaysia, but in any case safety with these countries should not really be a problem. As other have said, it's huge and you'll have to plan carefully as distance are massive there.

I'm all for dreaming big and going for it. If you can get a US visa, even is you have to do a shorter trip because of budget, go for it. But know that SEA can be way more accessible and much cheaper to you, and I'd bet you'll have a great time.",1629103552,h94uyty,t3_p4xl4u,/r/solotravel/comments/p4xl4u/usa_vs_sea_for_a_first_time_traveller_with_a_weak/h94uyty/,1,solotravel

rosegarden98,t2_3lfp0hae,"For some reason I can't reply directly to your questions so ill add another comment. Covid test center was available within walking distance from split airport. 15 mins for antigen test and cost 75 krona or about $12 usd. Just need to make sure you have your passport. I believe you can test at or near dubrovnik airport as well not sure about zagreb. I stumbled upon a testing site in Hvar walking down a random alley. I booked hotels in advance because the requirements said you have to but honestly no one looked at my paperwork. Just stamped my passport and sent me on my way. Coming back into the US, the airline did really review the covid test information though. 

I was only there for 10 days so I packed in a lot each day and was up early every morning. That works for me but for others it may be exhausting. I did dubrovnik for 2 days, 1 day tour in Montenegro, 1 in Bosnia and rest of time was in split island hopping.

If there are any restaurants that are on your must eat list, make reservations in advance. Maybe just a day in advance but they do book up quick.

coachcrowder,t2_bph6igwv,"I think it’s not terrible advice if, like they say in the exchanges, you’re doing two things: 1. Ready for them to come in case they don’t bail, and 2 being ready for Drawing boundaries and outlining expectations because of that. If it’s 50/50 ish, almost okay if this person joins, I think this is a risk one can take. I find I’m pretty go with the flow as it is so I could see myself “seeing what happens.” If she cancels, you’ve saved face. If she doesn’t, is it really the worst? 

Now, I have a friend who I love, who loves to travel, who for some reason — I think I might not like to travel with. We are too similar sometimes and too different other times. If it were this friend, I’d not take the risk. On an active trip we’d have enough to do, but in a beach context someone is going to have a bad time feeling like they’re doing what the other one wants. I love sitting in the sun, he hates it/is allergic. He loves climbing and diving and swimming, I hate heights /have phobias and I only like water if there aren’t too many surprises. I’d feel there’s no chance we’d both enjoy PR the same way. We’d be torn apart with our different desires. So I would not wait for him to bail if I knew I’d be sad/dreading it when I see him all happy in the airport. As much as I love him and love travel with more equal footing for our interests. 

That’s the friend I’d say “I really love you, and I really want to travel with you, and I know you think PR is easier, but I seriously want to SHOW you a place and I wasn’t thinking of PR as being the kind of trip we’ve discussed, where we’ll be active which we have in common. This one, I wanted to be passive” and before she interrupts, “and on my own to get some alone time on the beach, clear my head, very opposite kind of trip I guess,” and if that sinks in okay, I’d add the promise, if it’s genuine “but seriously let’s go on a world class trip together, or another US place like Alaska or Guam or Hawaii, and we can check these fun things off.”

Don't write off travelling with friends, I've travelled alone for years and can honestly say I'm happy enough doing both. Pick the friends carefully and set boundaries, make sure that when you're with them you're enjoying their company, and make sure to still meet new people. Others will dilute the overbearingness that can come from spending too much time with someone.

Also, to all the people saying she was rude to invite herself; I disagree. If she's a good friend as OP suggests and they'd been discussing travel plans, then it's not super unusual. I'm sure that she probably doesn't understand why you'd want to travel alone when someone wants to join you, but if you'd said immediately that you were hoping to go alone she would've respected that. At this stage you need to nip it in the bud now or go through with that she may potentially come with you.

The plus is that we have almost every biome in the world -- southwest desert, chaparral, deciduous forest, swamp, subtropics, alpine, temperate rainforest, etc.

SE Asia will have more international backpackers and is cheaper, but I imagine getting a Visa for each individual country would be exhausting.

Flying to/from non-hub airports can get really pricey, and when calculating in layovers, security screening, sometimes it isn't very time efficient either.

JoWeissleder,t2_3me5940n,"Of course not. You do whatever excites you.
And not every place is interesting. I've left places after thirty minutes of arriving.

Just... The statement of ""getting bored"" after seeing only the most tiny fraction of a city (or nation!) I can only interpred as somebody checkmarking the first three pages of a Lonely Planet under the illusion that handful of churches, towers and shopping malls are what defines the place or holds its interest.
And then it's packing up and looking at the next main Street in the next city.

And that way of judging place wouldn't make sense to me. OF COURSE a two days weekend trip to Berlin is worthwhile and a nice thing to have but saying we grew bored of it after that would be just ignorant nonsense.

IF being somewhat picky we have zero chance exploring personal points if interest within a weekend.

Still, I don't expect people to stay in a place that doesn't click with them. Of course not.

I did a solo trip to Spain before the pandemic. I spent a day walking from one town to another with a guide - just the two of us. We bonded over a shared love of language learning and movies. She practiced her English and I practiced my Spanish.

We recommended a lot of movies to each other, and I've spent the last four years tracking them down and watching them - first in English and then in Spanish. Great fun.

You'll find something in common - food, wine, books, soccer, whatever you like - and you'll bond over it. Make sure to ask detailed questions about their family. People love talking about themselves, and most guides are excited to share their love of their country with foreigners.

Poor Ottawa. :-/

I happen to like it, and it's a bit less boring compared to a decade ago, but I'm biased from having family there, and for years the running gag was that everything fun was 90 minutes away in Montreal.

As a New Yorker, I like Ottawa, but it's because I go there to mellow out with family versus run around and do stuff. Given your compressed schedules, unless you're collecting national capitals, I don't blame you for skipping it. It's effectively a mini-Toronto in feel, and the food/ethnic stuff is better done in Toronto or Montreal. It doesn't mean never visit, but visit when you have more time. :-)

Couple of watering holes I like. Depending on your style and where you are staying. Sainte Elisabeth Pub has quite a cool outdoor courtyard, and the bit of Saint Catherine's street it is off is very classic ""seedy"" Montreal. Reservoir is a bar off St Laurent that has a nice rooftops seating area, craft beer and nice snack menu. Usually busy but late afternoon in the week you should be fine. Terasse St Ambroise is a little out of the way in the west, but large and run by a pretty big local brewery. Very popular summer spot. 

Smoked meat at The Main on St.Laurent is good, although you might go to Shwartz for the photo op. There is a very good ice cream place right across the street from there. Poutine is pretty good just about anywhere, with a steamed hot dog for that classic experience. 

I would suggest parking somewhere (maybe out of the city if you are on a budget). Stay in the city centre, plateau area near a metro and use public transport to get around. Public transport is great in Montreal and driving is awful. Bixi is a popular docked bikeshare service that is good for getting around, just plan your journey to avoid big hills. 

I lived in Montreal for around 7-8 years so feel free to ask questions if you are looking for anything specific",1628948584,h8wr8me,t3_p3r5hg,/r/solotravel/comments/p3r5hg/torontomontreal_recommendations/h8wr8me/,2,solotravel

Don't forget that you are the visitor. You are the one showing interest in their place. Of course the guide is going to carry most of the conversation. He/she is proud of their location and determined to show its best face. 

If conversation dips, just ask questions. It doesn't have to be about deep socio-political things. If you drive past a fuel station with a strange name, ask about it! 

""Hey, why is that fuel station called 'Cara Gorda'?"" 

""Oh, that place was run by a very fat woman named Maria. She had a big fat face so she named it ""Fat Face"". Very funny! Everyone loved her. One time...""
