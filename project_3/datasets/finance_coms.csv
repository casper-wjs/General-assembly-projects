So why did the US not have inflation in the first 7 rounds of QE? Starting in 2008, especially given all the inflation scares and the size relative to GDP then. Why no inflation after each of the first QEs?  
Why was there not inflation in the Euro from 2009 on? Why no QE in the other European countries that do it?  
And Japan... didn't have inflation after 400% of GDP because why? All currencies are convertible into all other currencies, why would Japan doing QE 13 times larger than the US (relative to GDP) not lead to inflation because their currency (like all currencies) is convertible to the dollar? Also, even if related to the dollar... The US has ALSO been doing QE since 2008... So again, why hasn't the dollar also been inflating and instead had disinflation?  
The simple question is: if QE dilutes the money supply, why would no currency that has ever done QE had sustained inflation? And why in the world would they have disinflation/deflation from diluting the money supply?

Willing_Fig_9235,t2_9e26mpk3,"So let's start with All economies (especially US but ex-Japan).

There isn't one answer to this so you might hear different ones from different practitioners depending on their background, i'll just answer it through my lens.

We did have an inflationary effect. You must understand where most of these economies were pre-QE, most of them were facing huge deflationary pressures from multiple sources. QE did help clamp that down, the key thing that we haven't seen yet is Stagflation, which is what worries me and literally everyone else right now. The biggest reason for all of this succeeding mostly relied on the actual use of the new monies being ""printed"". When it comes to actual hyper-inflation, all the examples we see from history are of economies printing cash to repay bonds issued in foreign currencies and place orders in the local economy to revive struggling industries/prop them up. So here think of Weimar Republic / Zimbabwe etc. All of these obviously have inflationary effects. You can argue that the US does that too, but the key difference here is the reserve currency status enjoyed by the US. So an argument can be made that the inflation caused is distributed amongst the many constituents of it's users. That's why you might notice a Japanese, Chinese or Russian central bank head lambast US about the constant QE/printing. 

All the money that is ""printed"" isn't really being used, since the GFC of '08-09, its largely been used to bolster bank balance sheets. It's easy to notice how strong the US Bank balance sheets are compared to literally any other country in the world. Dimon keeps bragging about the ""Fortress Balance Sheet"" he's built, and tbh, he's not wrong. That shits admirable. There's obviously tons more, but these 2 are the main ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

About the convertibility issue:

Most developing country currencies aren't convertible, or at least not fully convertible. The Chinese RMB, for instance, isn't convertible, neither is the Indian Rupee. After the Asian Financial crisis in the 90s, they all pretty much firmed up their stance on convertibility. The Japanese situation with the counteraction of the population would not be possible, at least not conceivably, in China or India for instance. I'd recommend looking up the list, you'll only find developed economies on the full convertibility status, the rest of them are somewhere on the continuum of no-partial convertibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up, the QE has been counter-acting disinflation/deflationary forces. So yes, there is inflation, but the severity of the situation needs to be considered in a context of no QE. The picture becomes a little clearer then. 

Again, it's not an exact science and we are living through it right now. A situation that is evolving everyday. For reference, most of us have experienced the chatter on at least 2-3 of the last crises, when LTCM happened everyone lost their shit. The conversations were equally ridiculous in terms of possible severity, if not more, in relation to today. And look around, has much changed? It is important to judge the situation at hand, as you maneuver through a crisis, but it is equally important to hold your bearings and understand that things might change but they never do so drastically enough. Bitcoin isn't going to be legal standard for instance lol. Would you like to discuss that?

travelisfree,t2_ad0j7,"So... I didn't hear a single reason why QE - which is supposed to be a major dilution of the money supply - isn't inflationary. 

Why would a minor increase in gold reserves in WW1 cause inflation and not an exponential increase? Why would minor deficit spending in France and England cause major inflation by 1923... but not exponential increase in the US today?

My personal philosophy and understanding of logic is to *not* believe things without evidence. There is absolutely no evidence that QE is inflationary (other than they hypothetical idea that it could have been worse... which isn't evidence). 

The truth is, the Fed even admitted that M1 and M2 were not relevant measuring tools of money in 1974 and this is why they created M3. But as Greenspan continued to lament, we can't track how many dollars are being created still.

Also, I highly recommend reading directly from the source and not speculation on Youtube and Bloomberg.

Read the various [BIS.org](https://BIS.org) reports on how the dollar shortage caused the global financial crisis in 2008. The repo market had mass failures well above what should have been related to mortgages (as Bernanke explained to congress during the crisis). 

If you can begin to understand how shadow banking had a collateral shortage, and therefore understand the Great Financial Crisis, you'll be able to understand what QE is. 

It doesn't sound like you understand how Repo works or why it exist, but I assure you it is at the center of the GFC and the entire monetary system.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is confusing, and honestly it takes years and years of research to understand. But let me know if you have any questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess, lastly, out of curiosity, I'd love to hear your predictions on what is going to happen with inflation over the next months or years? I think this one subject can clarify our differences:

What will happen with inflation? Will CPI continue to go up? Is there any chance it crashes?

What do you think is the most likely scenario for stocks? Will they go up? Is there any chance a crash much bigger than March 2020 happens?

Finally, what do you think will happen to corporate junk bonds/CLOs and mortgage backed securities? Will those remain stable? Any chance those have a major decline?",1632257136,hdrieur,t1_hdqvlfi,/r/finance/comments/pr9do5/inflation/hdrieur/,1,finance

allexj,t2_u2avs,"Some ethical questions about **cryptos** and the future

1. Decentralization here and there, a good word, but who is stopping smart contracts or exchanges from becoming the new banks and loan sharks? All those who say ""banks get into debt!!11! they print money from nothing!!11!!"" but why would it change in better with crypto? Debts will always exist also in crypto world.
2. We have to agree on one fundamental thing: some say cryptocurrencies are useful to block and find money laundering or criminal acts but others say they will have to be more and more anonymous because currently ""traditional"" payment methods (with credit cards, bank transfers or also cash)  are better for privacy (since there is no public blockchain and no public transactions). What do you think that will be the future of cryptos in this regard?
3. I noticed that cryptocurrencies are seen more as a type of investment (so they are kept by people hoping that in the future the value will grow to earn money) rather than being used as real exchange currencies to buy stuff.  Also how can they be used as exchange currencies if for example in El Salvador a citizen does his shopping and costs ""x"" btc and then he arrives home and sees that btc has gone down and therefore he has lost money.... It's not very good.

They can issue bonds, but they are of equal value to the assets they buy. Either way, QE is always swapping assets of equal value determined by market rates. Period.

How do you assume that the Fed issuing bills in repo is any different? other than the right to repurchase the next day - which is what they would do in QQE anyhow.
It is literally the same. Because they are swapping assets of equal value the Fed has the ability to buy back their assets - which they often do!
I'm not ""claiming"" these are asset swaps, they are asset swaps. You think they just give JPM $2.5 trillion? No, they bought $2.5 trillion in MBSs and other assets as well.

Like in March everyone was worried about the SLR cliff, but they literally got it reversed as to whether or not tbills were limiting in loans. Or everyone writes about repo (because shadow banking is the new bank reserves) but no one understands it. It took me a decade of reading before I felt like I understood the 2008 financial crisis. 

Well, yes, is the short answer. This is EXACTLY what happened in 2008. Like just google ""labor shortage"" ""2008"", or look at CPI in 2008 - [https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm)

It went up to 5.6% in summer 2008 and slowly came down, then boom. We went up to 5.4% and it's slowly coming down, but last month was actually the biggest drop ***ever*** in CPI if you remove rent (which usually lags because housing is less liquid than virtually everything else). 

This is as old as the hills - in fact, I just read Phil Fisher's book from 1957 and he talked about this cycle then: there is a shortage, so we build and over build supply, then demand normalizes and we're left with a glut of supply. Heck, this happened to an extreme degree in 1929. And even Keynes said deflation is more dangerous than inflation.

Ultimately though, and this is more complicated, I believe there is a global dollar shortage (hence bill yields still going down) because TBills are the global currency and there is demand globally and a flat supply. So as happened in 2008, one form of USD denominated bills went bad (MBSs) and everyone had to bid up the price of tbills, but there simply weren't enough to clear all trades (like gold shortage in the great depression). Hence financial institutions diving into [reverse repo at insane levels](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD).

Reverse repo is simply lending in the repo market, they are the same thing. Simply the Fed is now lending in it to supplement the collateral market.

I don't think you understand the repo market or how it is THE driver of the global economy (the EuroDollar system). EuroDollars are a clearing mechanism - like chips and fedwire. And I've posted some questions that you've brushed over that would help you think through these concepts.

Let me pose some more and reiterate and try to answer them:

- why are real yields negative? If inflation is real why would any financial institution bid up the price of 30 year zero coupons? That would be the worst most terrible thing to hold during inflation. Why are long yields down? (The answer is that 30 year on-the-run STRIPS are THE clearing token of the global economy and there is a shortage of them).

- why would any financial institution park their money with the Fed in repo for .05% (point zero five PERCENT) PER ANUM? Why not park your money in a higher yielding asset like MBSs, CLOs, CMOs, etc...? Why would too much money lead to ridding CMBs and taking a lower yield? Who would do that? (And wouldn't too much money lead to higher yields?)
(The answer is collateral risk or counter party risk, not too much dollars).

- why has Japan had 20 years of deflation if QE is dilutive? Why assume our QE of 30% of GDP is inflationary but Japan is up to 400% and no inflation?

- why after helicopter money in early 2008 and QE starting in late 08 not lead to inflation? Why?

- then when again in 2013/2014, 2016, 2018? Why no inflation? Why would we have disinflation after 7 rounds of QE!?

- why no inflation in Europe after QE? Why deflation? ALL countries that have done QE for a long time have had disinflation, not inflation... Why?

- why is China (virtually every country) complaining about not being able to get enough dollars if there is too much?

- why did the repo market stop complete due to a collateral shortage if there was too much liquidity? (If you understand that we had a collateral based system and there is too little, you'll understand why derivatives exist, why repledging and rehypothetication exist, and what caused the Great Financial Crisis).

- why are financial institutions repledging and rehypotheticating TBills (and other collateral) 6 to 20 times? If there was too much money, why are they forced to share TBills? (I know I'm getting in over your head now, but I think this is a good thing to look into).

Here's some light reading to better understand this https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull15.htm

Yes, the banks have cash, but they are sitting on it. The Fed gave them cash (which was from TGA and not printed or diluted) thinking they would lend it and thus multiply and create inflation (this is why the Fed restricted buybacks for one year, to force them to lend). But they are butting heads with the banks because the banks stopped lending, thus not multiplying.

Kid, I'd love to hear you explain each of these bullet points from your dollar dilutive world view.",1632074870,hdhonyv,t1_hdhijqc,/r/finance/comments/pr9do5/inflation/hdhonyv/,0,finance
travelisfree,t2_ad0j7,"Exactly. Same shortage. The dollar being the ""reserve"" currency (meaning dollar denominated debt, mostly TBills) is a way of saying that all trade is cleared in dollars. If other countries can't get enough (El Salvador) they're locked out of global trade. (This is also what causes us to be a net importer).

Cash is great. Just sit on cash until a big market collision happens, then hopefully I can get some Berkshire stock or whatever on discount.
I started buying zero coupon TBills (ZROZ) in spring because it is what is needed in a collateral shortage (like 2008, and I assume is what is causing reverse repo to spike), but dollars are easier and perhaps safer. But I sold all my stock, so I'm peak paranoid 😃 I'm getting too much 2008 vibes, so I figure better safe than sorry.

Willing_Fig_9235,t2_9e26mpk3,"I havent read through your entire post earlier so i apologize for that, but id love to answer your question.

Tbh Japan is a conundrum for everyone. Initially it was meant to fight rampant deflation/disinflation and at least marginally spark inflation, BoJ was hoping it would be able to raise growth by hiking inflation since nominals really werent that great. But it hasnt worked at all, and this has surprised everyone really. The best arguments i have heard, that i partially agree with, is the full convertability of the JPY. So whenever rates rise in the US (not isolated to the US but a grand majority of the noticeable correlation to this argument was with the USD). Most pensioners/retirees would immediately convert their JPY and counteract the BoJ. This theory is obviously in concert with the ageing of their population. 

Yields

This is honestly a fairly simple answer, and with the preceeding conversation we had it might seem a little weird, but please feel free to ask pointed questions about it and id be glad to elaborate/point you to the right resources. 

Simple answer = Fed.

The insane amount of printing/asset purchases theyve done since covid are unprecedented. Ive personally seen their book balloon from sub-$3T to the $8T+ it is today (FYR: It was ~$4T in 2019, around october if im not wrong). So theyve doubled their book in ~2 years and the numbers are simply staggering. It creates a lot of latch on effects that makes our jobs considerably harder. Since we use the 10yr as a discount rate (depends on instrument but this is the most widely used in my experience). They essentially started doing this by buying any and all T bills in sight, im sure you're aware that bond prices are inversely related to prevailing rate (if rate goes down price goes up). If you look at any Investment Grade Bond (IG) fund, one thing youll find common amongst them all is that they sucked throughout the last decade but they suddenly began to do really really well during covid. ^ Is the reason. 

Now think about the knock on effect of this, we are all afraid that the world is going to shit, so we want UST bills/notes ofc. But the fed keeps buying everything in sight. This pushes rates even lower since our other portfolios (equities mostly) are doing extremely well, abnormally well, so we need to park some of those profits and lock in gains. Guess whats the only place to do that reliably 100% guaranteed? UST!! 
Id also recommend considering pension funds, again, i cant be too specific to maintain discretion i can only point you in the right direction. Id check the millman index, specifically, funded status of DB pension plans. Thats half your answer about the super duper excess demand, over and above the fed. 

The other gift that keeps on giving is congress that cant agree on whether it wishes to pay its bills. All of which needs to be done through issuing T bills, so T bill supply is super super short. And we are required by regulation to maintain a certain amount of T bills that are issued. Same as above, discretion but pointing you in the right direction, check treasury auctions and demand, look at the timing of that with reverse repos (beginning around April this year if im not wrong)

(Our mandated reserves are based on deposits, also recommend checking out total holdings in money market mutual funds. Not making claims here lol, but numbers dont lie. Im not exactly sure where youd get the mmf numbers unless you have bbg terminal but id google, im sure theres something you can find. Check the spike in deposits, you can draw a straight line from the beginning of the pandemic if you keep total bank deposits sheet under it. Banks started pitching mmfs instead of taking deposits because of this reserve requirement crap.)

I hope that clarified a few points, there are more, but please feel free to ask any pointed questions. Request to keep it relatively short pls.

So why did the US not have inflation in the first 7 rounds of QE? Starting in 2008, especially given all the inflation scares and the size relative to GDP then. Why no inflation after each of the first QEs?

Why was there not inflation in the Euro from 2009 on? Why no QE in the other European countries that do it?

And Japan... didn't have inflation after 400% of GDP because why? All currencies are convertible into all other currencies, why would Japan doing QE 13 times larger than the US (relative to GDP) not lead to inflation because their currency (like all currencies) is convertible to the dollar? Also, even if related to the dollar... The US has ALSO been doing QE since 2008... So again, why hasn't the dollar also been inflating and instead had disinflation?

The simple question is: if QE dilutes the money supply, why would no currency that has ever done QE had sustained inflation? And why in the world would they have disinflation/deflation from diluting the money supply?

I believe 1- Large scale criminal enterprises will find methods to counter this. 2- Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Centralized absolute control over the currency will have a more downside than upside for the people. Yes, it will likely prevent some money laundering. At the same time, this power will be used to hurt the general public. Want to protest something? CCP will just pull the data on all the cell phones in the area and freeze their assets. This is to much power. I fear the US is going down the same path... Now they are trying to track all bank accounts with $600+ in transactions under the premise that it will help raise funds for the infrastructure bill. Bullshit. It's to further surveillance.

“Diversify among different brokers,” she said. “Everybody who had invested with Madoff, … we all thought we were diversified because there were tech stocks. There were commodities stocks.”

Greenberg agreed that people should spread their investments among more than one advisor.

“I have a great deal of sympathy for people who had all of their money with Madoff,” she said. “It’s not wise to put all your eggs in one basket, to use an old fashioned saying.”

…


The net winners argued they should have been covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corp., the industry-funded nonprofit organization — of which Madoff’s firm was a member — established in the 1970s to protect clients of failed brokerage firms. SIPC guarantees customers’ securities up to $500,000, and cash up to $250,000. But SIPC — and Picard, who is paid by SIPC — argued that the guarantee does not cover a fraud like Madoff’s in which no securities were actually purchased. The courts agreed, completing what Kent called a “triple tsunami.”

“At first you find out you lose all your money, and then the next day you think, ‘Oh, that’s OK, I have insurance.’ And then the third day you find, ‘Oh no, not only do you not have insurance, you are now being forced to pay back any money you took out,’” she said.",1631882858,hd790jn,t1_hd6yy1a,/r/finance/comments/ppl648/manhattan_us_attorney_announces_additional/hd790jn/,1,finance

jorge1209,t2_rcyrj,"I would not assume that the cost to the broker to execute a trade is anywhere close to $4.99. That may be what some brokers charged, but that doesn't mean it cost that much.

Prior to May 1st 1975 broker prices to execute a trade were set by the exchange and were extremely high. It cost hundreds of dollars to trade. When the SEC ended that system, we saw the introduction of ""Discount brokers"" who would only charge you $40 a trade. What a deal right?!?!

The price consumers will pay is largely based on what they think a good is worth, not the true cost to create the good. Coming from that insanely high price point it takes a long time to get consumer expectation of prices down to the ""free"" level that we have now reached. 

In addition it is obvious that computer technology has dramatically reduced the actual cost of execution to the point where it is probably only a few cents. Even firms which don't participate in PFOF can just absorb the cost as [a courtesy to customers](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/transaction-fees-commissions/stocks).

Imagine a client with $1MM in named stocks in their portfolio, then they will probably generate at least $100k/yr in cash dividends, which is something like $10k/mo. Assuming they don't regularly login to that account and use those dividends to make purchases you might assume an average daily balance of at least $5k cash in their brokerage account. Even at a relatively low 1% interest rate that is worth $50/yr in carry. How many trades could you process with $50? Probably a lot. I would bet that the carry interest on the dividends generated by the average investors named stocks is sufficient to cover the cost of their transactions.

If there is a change and PFOF is barred the real question is consumer expectation, not actual cost to the broker. If consumers say ""I guess the broker does deserve to get paid here"" then a nominal fee might become the norm (and then the question is what is ""nominal"" $1? $5? $10?)

On the other hand I think it more likely that consumers just assume that ""trades are supposed to be free"" and refuse to use platforms that charge them.

Nickjet45,t2_zk2nk,"&gt;U.S. Treasury officials have reportedly identified several risks posed by stablecoins.The government body is set to make 
recommendations for stricter rules surrounding cryptocurrencies. 
Treasury Weighs in on Stablecoins

&gt;Treasury officials have identified several ways that stablecoins could pose a risk to investors and the wider economy, Bloomberg reported Thursday.According to anonymous sources cited in the report, ensuring that investors can reliably move money in and out of tokens is a top priority, whether through centralized or decentralized exchanges. 

&gt;Additionally, the Treasury raised concerns about a market sell-off causing widespread financial instability and how certain stablecoins could scale up dangerously fast, outpacing national currencies. In particular, the sources expressed worry over the growth of tokens that are sponsored by tech giants like Facebook, which is currently developing its own stablecoin called Diem.   

&gt;While the comments on stablecoins are currently little more than recommendations from the Treasury, officials are said to be discussing plans for a more formal review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. If carried out, the council would closely assess whether stablecoins could pose an economic threat. 
The regulatory attention being paid to stable, dollar-pegged assets is not unexpected. In July, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with the Working Group on Financial Markets to discuss potential stablecoin regulations. The latest recommendations from Treasury officials indicate that regulatory decisions on stablecoins and the wider cryptocurrency market might be closer than anticipated. 

&gt;Over the past several months, stablecoin providers have faced increasing pressure from regulators and the crypto community. The largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether, has long faced scrutiny over whether its USDT coins are adequately backed by cash. Additionally, Tether executives came under investigation by the Department of Justice in July over possible misconduct during the company’s early years.  

&gt;Other stablecoin providers have not escaped inspection either. USD Coin, which is widely used on Coinbase, has recently been criticized for the lack of transparency regarding how its coins are backed. While Coinbase initially stated that “each USDC is backed by one U.S. dollar, which is held in a bank account,” the company has since updated its website to include cash equivalents in the backing. 

&gt;Stablecoins form an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing a great deal of utility to those investing in digital assets or participating in decentralized finance. As such, U.S. regulators are quickly identifying the risks associated with stablecoins before they become more widely adopted.",1631899509,hd8b8v6,t3_pq0cjr,/r/finance/comments/pq0cjr/treasury_prepping_stablecoin_clampdown_report/hd8b8v6/,18,finance

whatisliquidity,t2_5ns3g9vb,"I don't and don't really mess with Chinese anything except speculative bets here and there. Recently they've been dumping and pumping sectors regularly through ""anonymous regulators"". Casinos look promising short term without any really bad covid news.

My opinion: it's geopolitical for China. It's a win win for the CCP.  They want to be a superpower, have very specific ambitions and can't execute if they become further financially weakened. They can still prop up economic activity with reserves and weakening the yuan and it gives the CCP more influence then they already have on their internal markets.

It could also force America to continue inflating away debt. Compounded with slowing GDP growth and genuine supply side concerns a lot of which China has influence over it could mean economic slowdown for America. Not to mention as we continue to maintain low interest rates other countries regionally in emerging markets who hold American debt become irritated with the US and China can fill that void with real goods. A tactic they already use effectively which further diverts supply away from America and bolsters Chinese production.

I personally don't think the CCP wants to get into a financial pissing contest with America but it seems to be unfolding this way.

Bottom line if the CCP says one thing expect another. If they say they're waiting this out it means they're working feverishly behind the scenes to create a solution the CCP finds acceptable.",1631899707,hd8bq0u,t1_hd87udv,/r/finance/comments/pq2ge8/beijing_stays_out_of_evergrandes_financial_crisis/hd8bq0u/,23,finance
surferfear,t2_110alc,"OK the yacht comment was hyperbolic but the $25 million versus seven dollars thing was pretty much spot on. If you spent your entire life accumulating a nest egg and then you bet the farm on one money manager, then you deserve to be poor. Yes. That’s a financial Darwin Award. I honestly don’t think that that happened because the type of people who stay the course long enough to accumulate wealth probably didn’t do it by betting the entire farm on one guy.

If I spent 40 years earning 1 million or I spent 40 years accumulating 100 million, at any amount I wouldn’t be stupid enough to give my entire net worth, or even more than 25% of it, to any one guy. I don’t care if he’s the current chairman of the SEC, if he got a letter of rec from Christ or what else his qualifications are. Nobody gets more than 10% of my money. 

I am also concerned about the crypto people, but anyone putting more money in than they can afford to lose deserves what comes to them.

Banner80,t2_4yx0hi91,"&gt;U.S. regulators are quickly identifying the risks associated with stablecoins before they become more widely adopted.

Yes. The risk that the gig is up for the hamfisted way the US uses its currency for unfair advantage.

Stablecoins are the future and they are here to say. In 20 years the USD will not be the world's currency, and that's going to have a devastating effect to the US's ability to print money to solve it's horrible ineptitude in maintaining a federal budget, and it's unquenchable goblin thirst for manipulating markets.

The problem with stable coins today is the lack of transparency and regulation. I welcome stricter rules and aggressive oversight. This will only progress them faster, because they will have a stronger foundation and thus become more trustworthy.

I predict that the coin that the world settles on after B is going to be some sort of stablecoin. Once that happens, crypt market cap will amply surpass the USD, and the next big coin will actually be used as currency instead of just a proof of concept. And once that happens, the Fed's money printers will no longer be able to operate all through the night without consequences.

Regulators are now starting to understand my last paragraph, and they are afraid that the gig is up. And the US being the US, they think they can stop the future by just screwing us all over until we relent from progress. Much like the electric car and accessible health care, the gov can throw a tantrum and swing its club at all our heads, but eventually modernity will come to pass.

They can't stop the future, they can only delay it, make progress way more painful, and make sure that we all suffer an unnecessary toll to get there.",1631900674,hd8e111,t3_pq0cjr,/r/finance/comments/pq0cjr/treasury_prepping_stablecoin_clampdown_report/hd8e111/,7,finance

What insurance company is going to guarantee literally the best performance in history? Do you understand why that’s impossible?

Start a new coin called USDD and peg it to the USD. We pass regulation that says this coin is backed by the US gov and it stands as equal to a paper bill. We allow any exchange to give USD for USDD. We call it ""the first backed and regulated digital coin in the world"", and we push to make it the defacto around the globe. We are now in the driver's seat and can make any laws we want around it.

Fast forward 20 years, the USD + USDD market cap is 3 times larger than today, and we maintain our place as the world's currency, thus guaranteeing our ability to keep printing money and screwing up budgets and markets for the foreseeable century.

Banks had a solution to get rid of garbage debt, of repackaging it to the uninformed, or forcing it off via a malicious instrument like adjustable rate mortgages. So the worst lenders were incentivized to create garbage mortgages (unverified credit worthiness, inflated asset price), and churning them.

The culture of refinancing contributed greatly to house price inflation, because it became a cycle of ""name your own price"". With relaxed rules, loan originators would use an assessor that was in on it, and every property magically goes up maybe 10% from the last deal. Keep that up a few months and suddenly your house is ""worth"" so much more so time to refinance again. This scheme was not just in use by predators but by anyone seeking to max out ""their investment"" by refinancing the last asset at the new inflated price to buy another overpriced one.

Protection from draconian govs.

Potentially immune to inflation and deflation.

Universally accessible with simple tools like your phone.

One easy way to make sense of the benefits of a decentralized currency is to think more about the current conditions of emerging markets. People with no access to banking, and no easy means to perform non-paper transactions. Perhaps under political instability, at risk of having banking funds frozen or devalued, and forced to use a currency that inflates faster than you can buy food with it.

The same benefits that make a ton of sense in those situations are benefits that would make the first-world better as well, except with a lower but still meaningful impact. You may not be worried about USD inflation, but you still lose 2% on it every year. You may not be worried about the impediment to buying from a business across the atlantic, but you may still be subject to transactions that take several days and may be taxed or have unreasonable fees.

czl,t2_4xtds,"That same article further down mentions several more people in similar sad situations. 

Three further thoughts:

(1) media monetize eyeballs so focus is on sensational losses of the wealthy society icons; little people are hardly mentioned.

(2) financial savvy people have trouble understanding what it is like not to be financially savvy. 

Pinker calls the general case of this the “Curse of Knoweldge”:

https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-curse-of-knowledge-pinker-describes-a-key-cause-of-bad-writing

StartQuote

A common theory-of-mind task in which the experimenters invite young children into a lab and hand them a candy box. Expecting to find candy, the children instead find the box contains pencils. Ultimately, the children not only believe that other children entering the lab will expect to find pencils rather than candy in the box, but will say that they themselves knew all along what the box really contained. The children simply can’t reconstruct their prior ignorance about the bag’s contents (Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983).

EndQuote

Not just kids, adult experts make this error all the time. This is how Pinker explains why so much technical communication is hard to understand / poor quality. The more expert you are the more important it is to realize that most people are not like you and to try to remember what the world is like when you do not know all the things you know.

(3) finally in modern society we depend on and are so used to dealing with reasonable people that it is hard to imagine how much at risk we are from rouges. A ill intent by even a single person can easily end your life.   When you are a passenger in a car / plane / bus / train usually there is just one person you have to trust. Even when you are in control or are just walking such a vehicle could crash into you. Ditto in the pharmacy when your prescription is filled. Ditto when your food is grown and/or your meals are prepared. How do you protect yourself? You are financially savvy so have that on your mind often but how do you verify medicine you got matches your prescription and will not kill you?

It is hard to admit but when you think about it deeply enough most of us today are vulnerable dummies for many things and for many people this incompetence includes investments.  The “Curse of knowledge” may be  hiding that fact from you.",1631911932,hd94g26,t1_hd8jr50,/r/finance/comments/ppl648/manhattan_us_attorney_announces_additional/hd94g26/,1,finance

If we keep USD as our ""base"" currency (i.e. everything is related in terms of dollars), and we are *buying* another currency, we'd like to see something like a 1.50 exchange rate (meaning 1.50 Euros per 1 dollar). You'd put in 1 dollar, and get 1.50 EUR. 

If the next day we have Euros and we see a price quote with USD as the base currency, we want that exchange rate to be lower. If it's 0.50 (which again means 0.50 EUR per 1 USD), then we'd be getting $2.00 for every 1 EUR we convert.

iKickdaBass,t2_ky9kr,"&gt; For instance, in 2007 we had a plethora of predatory lending making money hand-over-fist by stealing realty equity from the least financially-educated citizens in the country, synthetically pushing property prices up, and leaving them in loans that were impossible to pay back.

You seem like a smart enough guy to want to actually get to the bottom of the housing crisis, but you haven't done enough research to support this answer.  Your evidence is anecdotal and not substantiated by analytics.  The number of sub-prime loans as a percentage of total loans remained the same all throughout the housing bubble and sub-prime borrowers did not disproportionally account for more defaults than prime borrowers. This has been studied quite a bit and the evidence supports that speculation and flipping along with a glut of new homes were the primary causes of the housing crisis. Homeowners with good credit and those who owned multiple homes disproportionally defaulted, as interest rates rose and home sales slowed. They realized they could not make a profit by flipping the first home or by selling the second home and thus defaulted on the mortgages because they could trade down to something cheaper and weren't living in the second house to begin with. Additionally, researchers were surprised by the number of home owners who did not default given the negative equity in their homes. This is evidence that those people who were not speculating on the housing market were the ones least likely to default. 

There were just too many homes being built to support prices. This was evidenced by falling rents early in the cycle indicating that people were moving out of apartments and into homes, then rising rents as the cycled peaked indicating that people were not moving into the glut of homes that were priced higher than the market could afford. The number of new housing units coming to market was well over 2.3 million a year in the mid 2000s and fell to 500,000 shortly after. Here we are 13 years later and new homes constructed has yet to pass about 1.6 million a year. Also to put to rest the theory that adjustable rate mortgages were to blame, something like 88% of all defaults happened by borrowers who had the same or lower payments than at the time of origination. 

Finally notice that the narrative of predatory lending was primarily being driven by the media at the time and not by academia after the fact. After a long period of fact gathering and analysis, academic studies just don't support the original media narratives.",1631833351,hd51rk4,t1_hc82t5b,/r/finance/comments/pl15rk/debt_markets_eerie_calm_echoes_eve_of_2007_credit/hd51rk4/,1,finance

PFOF sounds nefarious so many people assume the issue is some kind of informational advantage that is being used against the retail traders via access to their order book. That could not be further from the truth. The very reason why retail orders are valuable enough to pay for is because they contain so little information. With a large enough book of aggregated retail trades, market makers are guaranteed to make a bid/offer spread since the orders are so close to random. 

The issue that Gensler and the SEC are worried about is that by routing so many orders to places other than the exchange, it reduces the amount of ""lit"" trades that are observable by everyone and therefore has negative impacts on price discovery. At some level this is intellectually dishonest. If retail trades are actually random, then their contribution to price discovery would simply to be to add noise around the actual price if they were routed to the exchange.

When you make a trade on for example robinhood, your low fee broker, Robinhood processes your trade and sends it to citadel in return for a fee.

Citadel is just a middle man providing liquidity; financialization is too abstract to appropriately be compared to logistics. Wholesaling is less of a stretch I guess.

As others in the thread have pointed out, the problem with PFOF is the informational asymmetry, not the existence of bid/ask spreads.

EtherVirtualMachine,t2_dwsc0ut5,"Friction caused by legal and regulatory compatibility for CBDC cross-border transactions through private payment service providers might burden domestic financial market integrity arising from a dissolve in efficient levels of market competition in the payment system.  
  
I guess one of the first question to ask is what role with central banks play with regard to issuance; Will design considerations for CBDC factor direct or indirect issuance to households and businesses?  
  
If CB's decide to provide Exchange Settlement Accounts (Australian Financial Market) used in the clearing process of transactions, directly to business and households, will this be to the advantage of healthy market competition among commercial banks / and payment service providers?  
  
If CB's decide payment service providers be responsible for the face services stemming from CBDC issuance, the capacity for payment service providers differs case by case, giving rise to friction in the promotion of healthy market competition.  
  
Another concern addressed at the health of financial markets is the CB's ability to maintain the capacity of banknotes as a reliable and secure means of transferring and storing value to those wanting the use of physical cash - which can be argued, supports the health of domestic payment systems adding to diverse methods of payment (and this want of use could reason from individual / merchant identity security, merchant convenience through point of sale / accounting etc.)  
  
Global policy action and compatibility (similar to Electronic Document Exchange standardization) targeted at financial market participants within complex markets to communicate common message standards (ISO 20022) and align their legal frameworks takes time. However, systems could be designed with international markets in mind, fostering conditions for a diverse range of private participants, relieving concerns for the health of payment systems and market competition, in due time.  
  
DLT networks capable of facilitating CBDC or even commercial bank USC's are sharpening interoperability capacities, and should lead to the establishment of a common global language (ISO Standards.) And further advancements in the technology may prove to aid CB's in the design of the necessary sovereign conditions accommodating CBDC's and Cryptoassets alike.",1631630020,hctondb,t1_hc6pc7u,/r/finance/comments/pkha41/digital_currencies_pave_way_for_deeply_negative/hctondb/,1,finance

Lestrade1,t2_2bspxubo,"&gt;**Disgruntled investors voice anger at headquarters as company appoints advisers and says firesale of assets won’t cover debts**  

&gt;Property giant China Evergrande Group has said that it cannot sell properties and other assets fast enough to service its massive $300bn debts, and that its cashflow was under “tremendous pressure”.  

&gt;Only hours after angry investors besieged its Shenzhen headquarters and the company denied it was set for bankruptcy, Evergrande issued a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange saying that a significant drop in sales would continue this month, which was likely to further deteriorate its liquidity and cash flow.  

&gt;The company blamed “ongoing negative media reports” for dampening investor confidence, resulting in a further decline in sales in September – usually a strong month for sales in China.  

&gt;Evergrande also said two of its subsidiaries had failed to discharge guarantee obligations for 934m yuan ($145m) worth of wealth management products issued by third parties. That could “lead to cross-default”, it said.  

&gt;And in a sign that restructuring plans are speeding up, the board also said it had appointed advisers to “assess the group’s capital structure, evaluate the liquidity of the group and explore all feasible solutions to ease the current liquidity issue”.  

&gt;Shares in the group closed down nearly 12% in Hong Kong on Tuesday. The statement also said it had failed to find a buyer in the distressed sale of its electric vehicle and property service subsidiaries, prompting shares in those businesses to fall by 25% and 12% respectively.  

&gt;Evergrande is one of the world’s most indebted companies, and has seen its shares tumble 75% this year, sparking fears among analysts of “a risk of contagion” spreading through China’s overheated property sector and also its banking system.  

&gt;Years of borrowing by Evergrande to fund rapid growth has combined with a crackdown on the industry by Beijing to fuel the crisis.  

&gt;The dramatic announcement on Tuesday follows a turbulent day on Monday which saw increasingly desperate protests by small investors and homebuyers demanding their money back.  

&gt;Chaotic scenes erupted at the company’s headquarters in Shenzhen as around 100 disgruntled investors crowded into the lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.  

&gt;More than 60 security personnel formed a wall in front of the main entrances to the towering skyscraper in the southern city where protesters gathered to shout at company representatives.  

&gt;Evergrande has been struggling to manage its enormous $300bn debt pile for several years  

&gt;Du Liang, identified by staff as general manager and legal representative of Evergrande‘s wealth management division, read out a repayments proposal for those who held wealth management products, according to financial media outlet Caixin, but protesters at the company’s headquarters appeared to reject it.  

&gt;“They said repayment would take two years, but there’s no real guarantee and I’m worried the company will be bankrupt by the end of the year,” said a protester surnamed Wang, who said he works for Evergrande and had invested 100,000 yuan ($15,500) with the company, while his relatives invested about 1m yuan.  

&gt;Hundreds of people in recent months have also protested on an online forum set up by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist party, seeking government help.  

&gt;Many analysts believe Evergrande will be forced to restructure its debt and possibly faces being dismantled under a government-orchestrated operation to ensure a soft landing that does not capsize the country’s bloated property market.  

&gt;But late on Monday, Evergrande responded to the speculation that it was facing a restructuring as “totally untrue”.  

&gt;“The recent comments that have appeared online about Evergrande‘s restructuring are completely false,” the company said in a statement.  

&gt;It went on to say the company “is indeed facing unprecedented difficulties at the moment, but it will firmly carry out its main corporate responsibilities, fully dedicate itself towards the resumption of work and industry”.  

&gt;The group will “protect housing transactions (and) intends to do everything possible to restore normal business operations, and fully guarantee customers’ legal rights and interests”, the statement added.  

&gt;However, the group faces serious financial problems and the statement on Tuesday appeared to lay bare the magnitude of the crisis which has seen its bonds fall to less than 75% face value in some cases. Some trading was suspended again on Tuesday amid wild swings in prices.  

&gt;After highlighting its problems raising cash from the firesale of properties and other assets, it said: “In view of the difficulties, challenges and uncertainties in improving its liquidity, there is no guarantee that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations under the relevant financing documents and other contracts.  

&gt;“If the group is unable to meet its guarantee obligation or to repay any debt when due or agree with the relevant creditors on extensions of such debts or alternative agreements, it may lead to cross-default under the group’s existing financing arrangements and relevant creditors demanding acceleration of repayment. This would have a material adverse effect on the group’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.”  

&gt;According to Caixin, Evergrande on Monday proposed that investors choose to accept 10% of the principal and interest of the matured product now and the rest via 10% instalments quarterly, payment by property assets, or by using the outstanding product value to offset home purchase payments.  

&gt;On Friday, Evergrande vowed to repay all of its matured wealth management products as soon as possible.  

&gt;Many buyers of Evergrande-built homes have expressed concern about down-payments made for projects now suspended by the property firm, airing concerns on Weibo, China’s Twitter equivalent.  

&gt;A report last week by Capital Economics said Evergrande had 1.4m properties it has committed to completing, as of the end of June.  

&gt;Analysts at the Hong Kong-based market intelligence firm Reorg described in a recent report how the disputes over contractor payments intertwined with Evergrande’s large exposure of unfinished properties that buyers – as is common in China – have already paid for upfront.  

&gt;“In extreme cases, if China Evergrande fails to complete pre-sold property projects on time, due to inability to pay contractors, China Evergrande will be liable to the purchasers for their losses,” Reorg said.  

&gt;“In line with industry practice, the group pre-sells properties prior to their completion – as a result, banks providing financing to end purchasers require China Evergrande to guarantee their customers’ mortgage loans. If a purchaser defaults on a mortgage loan, the group may have to repurchase the underlying property by paying off the mortgage.”

ThoseThingsAreWeird,t2_jzs4t,"When you're looking to buy / rent somewhere, you can either nip down to the local estate agents or check a site like Rightmove that aggregates properties. The vast majority of properties listed on something like Rightmove will be already built - the UK doesn't have a tradition of knocking down existing housing stock, which I think exists in Japan?

So for example [here's a list of houses for sale in Lewisham](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/find.html?locationIdentifier=REGION%5E85388&amp;propertyTypes=bungalow%2Cdetached%2Csemi-detached%2Cterraced&amp;mustHave=&amp;dontShow=&amp;furnishTypes=&amp;keywords=) (south of the river Thames, near the financial centre Canary Wharf).

When you find a property you like the look of you'll contact the estate agent to arrange a viewing, where you'll take a look around that property. If there's very high demand for a specific property then you might not view it, but that's uncommon. If you like the property you'll then go through the various legal bits, get a mortgage, that sort of stuff. From the point of view of someone in Asia the odd part may then be the waiting: If I'm trying to buy property A, the owners may be trying to buy property B, who are buying C, etc. This is called your ""chain"". When there's a lot of movement in the local property market then your chain can get exceptionally long, and can be prone to failing if someone's situation further down your chain changes.

I've not had experience of buying a new build. But when new build estates are being built there'll typically be a ""show house"" (aka ""model home"", or ""display home""). This will give buyers an idea of what the finished houses on the estate will look like. The houses that are under construction won't be exactly like the show house, but they'll be close enough.",1631635125,hcu14bg,t1_hctljm3,/r/finance/comments/pnxuto/china_property_giant_evergrande_admits_debt/hcu14bg/,2,finance

BanUbiquitousPlastic,t2_12zu5uk7,"Hong Kong is a historical western foothold in China and it was the training ground and launch point for the infiltration (Operation Yellowbird) of a legitimate protest by students and rural workers that led to the famous ""June 4th incident"" in Tiananmen Square.

China has the right to exert authority in order to quash color revolutions and insurgency backed by the UK and the USA, just as you would likely agree that western countries have the right to suppress foreign backed coups on their own soil. The difference is that these western countries use their propaganda apparatuses to point to these events and say ""look they're aUThOrITaRiAN.""

The same can be said about the USA backing of ETIM in Turkey and Afghanistan where now decades later China is forced to combat extremism caused by ETIM in places like Xinjiang. The USA sends terrorists or even people who intend to meet with terrorst groups to prison for life. China, on the other hand does ""anti-extremist reeducation"" and is lambasted throughout the western propaganda apparatus as ""committing genocide"" and once again being a ""dictatorship.""

Another great example is Cuba. Fidel is constantly criticized for his ""authoritarianism,"" but the reality is that Cubans are free to be politically vocal and they are free to protest. What they are not free to do is form pro-USA political parties or perform pro-USA protests. This is because if the USA is allowed a foothold in Cuba politically, the USA will crush Cuba and end their attempts to build socialism, just as the USA has done in dozens of South American countries, and tried to do in East Asia.

I say you believe propaganda because despite all of corporate media screaming about totalitarian China being very very bad &gt;:( you are unable to identify that it is manipulation. This is partially due to the fact that Americans tend to have little to no historical memory.

PM_UR_PLATONIC_SOLID,t2_10nxnv,"Min wage sucks. Look for higher-paying jobs.

Go to school student loans can supplement your income. More people are using student loans to get them through to a masters or PhD and then leaving the country. You can still visit the US, but they can't garnish your wages if you work outside of the country. Or, you know, you could pay them off. Basically, student loans are an investment in yourself. No matter what happens.... divorce, bankruptcy, jail.... no one can take your education from you.

The secret to getting ahead is to spend less than you make. Give yourself breathing room. Easier said than done, I know. Being poor is expensive, so find life hacks. Thrift stores in/near good neighborhoods will have designer clothing for cheap (especially in January when rich folks clean their closets to make room for Christmas gifts). Get a reliable car (or no car, if you can). Find roommates who pay their rent on time (including you). Eat healthy/learn to cook. Optimize your entertainment budget (i.e., a $60 video game that takes months to beat is better than 6 trips to the theatre. Netflix is cheaper than comedy clubs/concerts/movies.).

Basically, eliminate any and all waste, where it may be. That will get you to baseline. 

When I made minimum wage, I saved until I got $1000 in the bank. That became my new $0. When friends asked me out to eat, I would say ""sorry, but I don't have any money."" Having $1000 in the bank was worth the peace of mind. As I got older, my zero grew larger. Currently, it's $10,000. A lot can happen to you before $10,000 won't cover it. Any time my account gets down to $10,000, it's ""sorry, but I don't have any money"" again.

Get a free account on [mint.com](https://mint.com) and track your expenses, even if just for a few months. Be religious about it. It will help you understand how much little things like vaping and having a dog actually cost.

If you rent, ask your landlord if you can do any work on his/her rentals for extra cash. Everyone needs a little help sometimes, plus you learn good life skills for when you one your own place one day (or just don't want to wait for maintenance to get around to your ticket).

jorge1209,t2_rcyrj,"There are already reports mandated by the SEC that give summary statistics and compare execution quality against the NBBO. The problem is that everyone beats the NBBO and so the NBBO isn't really a good metric as everyone (at all levels) is executing AROUND the NMS system, not through it.

The problem at its core is with the NMS, not so much PFOF. The continuous time distributed system with less than universal access means that there is no ""one true price"". If you submit an order its possible that someone local to your exchange could pick it up at a price better than is advertised by any other exchange, and that in fact could happen that every exchange has better internal prices than are available across the wire. The NBBO is not the best bid or offer, its the the best of the worst. We need to think about alternatives to the NMS system, such as frequent discrete time auctions, and how pricing might be set in something like that vs the NMS system. But this makes our questions deeply counter-factuals. 

A great example is your ""$5 commission"" idea. What makes you think it will be $5? There are many brokers who don't participate in PFOF and charge zero commission. There may be no cost at all to eliminating PFOF.",1631545315,hcp4xwy,t1_hc539g0,/r/finance/comments/pk71s8/sec_needs_to_find_a_way_to_curb_payment_for_order/hcp4xwy/,1,finance

Second, even if Evergrande goes under the changes in banking regulations since 2008 means that no single bank should have excessive exposure to one entity. If Evergrande goes under, then JP Morgan wont directly take too big a hit. If China Minsheng goes under, then JP Morgan's exposure to them is also limited.
