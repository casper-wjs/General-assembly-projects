fltpath,t2_9x953mx2,"Thank you for the time and effort!

I found the video on youtube as well. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ)

at 6:13, you get an idea of the size...at 6:36, there is the concept. In space, all of the smaller deploy then the pieces link up.

They also state they will need 200 of these phased arrays in orbit for coverage?

Its an interesting prototype, but at this point, a prototype that has not launched yet, nor been tested in space.

I see difficulty getting all of those little pieces to link up in space...there has to be hundreds. We see the issues the World had with Starlink, these are very, very small at only 5m span, compared to this array...

Next year they will launch the first array. If it is successful, there will be one.

Page 32: Looking at their costs, currently, there is not enough cash on hand to build the first one and launch it. (the exact amount from the SPAC and capital raised to date exactly matches the cost for the first launch???)

Lets say that is true, so currently, they have no cash left, right? It has all gone to factory build and the prototype. They claim not to begin revenue generation until 2023...which I am not sure that one array can generate 9 million customers and $181M in rev.

That is asking alot from subscribers to add another monthly fee to their bill with very, very limited coverage (for many , many years)

It appears there will have to be a significant offering in Q1/Q2 simply to keep going and keep building arrays.

To the business model of providing coverage where none exists...

There are reasons, in many under or un-developed countries why there is no coverage, they simply have no money. Keep in mind, the ASTS fee is in addition to the cell phone providers fee, and of course, there is a cost of the cell phone itself. These cell phone companies provide cell phones and service where there is a market to pay for such.

Yes, it is nice when someone visits remote areas to have cell phone coverage, but I am not really sure that this is worth paying the extra costs for (especially with the very limited coverage)

and really, until there is infrastructure in developing areas, I see no reason for a cell company to provide cell phones and service, simply for the ASTS add on.

My opinions:

Its an interesting concept, but given the shear size and number of the required array, I see a regulatory hurdle. The time required to set up 200 of these is another big issue for me.

I simply do not see the numbers of subscribers ramping up that fast, given that there is one array with limited coverage for a few minutes a day when it is overhead.

At a current $2.35Billion valuation...this company is at the pre-development, pre-testing, pre-approval and pre-revenue phase....there will be many more rounds of dilution, and the valuation leaves no upside for at least 10 years if even successful.

niffrig,t2_5zhe7,It took more than 40 years to hit 700k aids fatalities.  At current rates covid will reach that in less than three years.  Cancers are a big one but I think it makes sense to stratify diseases by risk factors.  Because of that it's not apples to apples to compare covid to all cause cancers in my opinion.  The biggest cancer killer is lung at about 140k a year and second is colon/rectal at about 50k.  This two combined aren't matching year one covid.  Granted covid overall death rates should decline as we manage it better.  However we've yet to determine the longer term effects of covid..... Such as cancer like we see from things like HPV.  Anyway.  Tldr covid is arguably worse than AIDS or any particular cancer.  Luckily we have tools to combat it so maybe it doesn't have to be.

NeResearcher878,t2_9ztadljj,"I do.  Capital gains tax is about 10% less if you hold on to your stocks for a year.  That's why it's good to just buy stock you actually like.  I hold on to all my stocks.  Some, I have had for 15 years.  They're all up by alot.

I really like IRNT.   

I do think that it's going up faster after getting noticed.  It has a lot of trust in the cybersecurity community.   

It's a great opportunity for the people who can't invest on GOOG AMZN or other expensive high growth stock to invest in.  

It will follow the pattern of ascent as CRWD and other cybersecurity companies. But this one is a current favorite because of its CEO is a former NSA chief and its published white paper gain traction for its effectiveness so it will surpass CRWD price. 

Cybercrime is only getting worse so they're getting more government contracts and partnering with more corporations.

They’ve lived with it for 65 fucking years.

Now, this doesn’t mean that the market couldn’t still see this as a catalyst. BUT it will be short lived and more like a P&amp;D if so, because it’s backed by no behavioral change.

I really like IRNT.   

I do think that it's going up faster after getting noticed.  It has a lot of trust in the cybersecurity community.   

It's a great opportunity for the people who can't invest on GOOG AMZN or other expensive high growth stock to invest in.  

It will follow the pattern of ascent as CRWD and other cybersecurity companies.  CRWD ipo at $34 only two years ago.  But this one is a current favorite because of its CEO is a former NSA chief and its published white paper gain traction for its effectiveness so it will surpass CRWD price. 

Cybercrime is only getting worse so they're getting more government contracts and partnering with more corporations. 

It will go up and go up quickly with or without any pumping or dumping.",1632055255,hdgfyuv,t3_pqzoym,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqzoym/irnt_cost_to_borrow_for_shorts_calculations/hdgfyuv/,10,wallstreetbets

It would be like calling Bezo's retarded because a government crackdown crashed his stock and he lost billions. But if he sold that stock you guys would be saying he lost faith in the company. I dunno, I still think this sub has plenty more retards than this guy. Holding stock in the company you own while it crashes is just what happens when you own a company, that's why people like the owners owning lots of the stock in their company because it shows they have faith in it's future. I know I've seen this sub constantly get front page posts on a CEO every time he dumps .05% of his holdings in the company. ""He's lost faith, it's going to to tank!!!1!""

getBusyChild,t2_129emh,"*Chinese authorities have told major lenders to China Evergrande Group not to expect interest payments due next week on bank loans, according to people familiar with the matter, taking the cash-strapped developer a step closer to one of the nation’s biggest debt restructurings.*

*The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development told banks in a meeting this week that Evergrande won’t be able to pay its debt obligations due on Sept. 20, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Evergrande is still discussing the possibility of getting extensions and rolling over some loans. The developer will also miss a principal payment on at least one loan next week, one of the people said.*

*Evergrande’s inability to repay bank interest is the strongest sign yet of liquidity stress at the world’s most-indebted developer, which is sitting on more than $300 billion of liabilities. Chinese authorities are already laying the groundwork for a debt restructuring, assembling accounting and legal experts to examine the finances of the group. With senior leaders in Beijing silent on whether they will allow Evergrande creditors to suffer major losses, bondholders have priced in slim odds of a rescue.*

*It’s unclear whether Evergrande, founded by billionaire Hui Ka Yan, intends to pay about $84 million of dollar-bond interest due Sept. 23.*

*The company’s complex web of obligations to banks, bondholders, suppliers and homeowners has become one of the biggest sources of financial risk in the world’s second-largest economy. Bank and property stocks slid after Bloomberg reported the delayed payments.*

*Evergrande’s debt shrank to 571.8 billion yuan ($89 billion) as of June 30, the lowest in five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But trade and other payables climbed 15% from six months earlier to a record 951.1 billion yuan. The company has received down payments on yet-to-be-completed properties from more than 1.5 million homebuyers.*

*Most of Evergrande’s working capital in now being used to resume construction on existing projects, the housing ministry told bankers, according to one person familiar with the matter.*

*Evergrande’s failure to meet its obligations on time has led to protests across China by homebuyers, retail investors and even the developer’s own staff, raising the prospect of social unrest if the property giant’s troubles spin out of control. The company said on Tuesday if it’s unable to repay debts on time or get creditors to agree to extensions or alternative arrangements, it may lead to cross-default.*

*Evergrande and China’s housing ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.*

*Uncertainty over Evergrande’s fate has fueled outsized swings in its bonds and shares, with the latter plunging 81% this year. The stock fell 5.4% in Hong Kong. Trading of Evergrande’s 5.9% local bond was suspended after prices plunged.*

*The CSI 300 banks index headed for a third successive loss, losing as much as 1.5%. A gauge of property stocks slid 2.4%.*

*Guangdong officials have turned down at least one bailout request from Hui, who owns a controlling stake in the developer, a person familiar with the matter said this week.*

*Bond investors are bracing for missed payments, with some Evergrande notes trading near record lows around 26 cents on the dollar. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have both downgraded Evergrande this month, citing an increasing likelihood of default.*

*Whether the selloff drags down the broader credit market may depend on the company’s ability to buy time with banks. A messy default on loans could stoke fears of widespread contagion, something Xi Jinping’s government has been keen to avoid even as it tightens financing restrictions on overstretched developers and discourages government bailouts.*",1631709320,hcxyk3a,t3_pop89z,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pop89z/china_tells_banks_evergrande_wont_pay_interest/hcxyk3a/,70,wallstreetbets

“We have managed to secure more capacity for this year compared to last year, with accessible capacity expected to grow quarter by quarter during 2021. Looking further ahead, we are taking measures to work with our strategic foundry partners to further enlarge our longer-term capacity pool. We will give more details as they come about,” concluded Mr. Jordan Wu.

First quarter driver IC revenue for automotive amounted to $43.7 million, up 16.4% sequentially and up 44.3% year-over-year. Automotive driver IC business accounted for more than 14% of total revenues in this quarter. Notwithstanding the decent growth, the Company is still suffering from severe foundry capacity shortage for automotive applications.
