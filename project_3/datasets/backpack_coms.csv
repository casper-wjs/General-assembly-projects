I don't know where you got the bag in the sun idea but the way exterminators rid a structure of bbugs is to crank the heat up to 130°c for several hours, so the bag in the sun might do it. Borax in the wash definitely will. It's probably good to check whether you go. I have never seen them in my travels but I know someone who brought them home from a cruise ship. She was fucking freaked so I helped her. Looked up the remedies on the net and the Borax revealed the majority were hidden behind the baseboard at the head of her bed.

Hey everyone. I have a backpacking trip lined up for Canyonlands NP next year. I've been an East coaster all my life and have been using a bear box to store food and scented items (weighty, sure. But I find it more convenient then hanging). When I visit Canyonlands I'd like to leave my bear box behind and use the room and weight it took up for extra water storage. Now my question is, if I'm in the desert and there aren't an abundance of trees to hang my food in at night, where exactly and what is going to be the best way to store my food?

TheTaters,t2_9ryja,"Thanks for the info! 

I am old, I still navigate with maps. I look over dozens of maps and memorize them, then take 1 or 2 with me for navigation. I had the original Spot back in the day but haven't used it in years because it wasn't that useful. It actually caused my family to panic when it placed me in a lake instead of next to it, then failed to update for hours. My family though I had drown when I actually had no issues at all.

Would the inreach work well enough for my PLB? I also want to give my family peace of mind since it is typically just me and my dogs traipsing through the woods. I don't want a repeat of it placing me 100 feet off into a lake and then failing to update!",1632328668,hdv25ni,t1_hdu5i2i,/r/backpacking/comments/pqwd1u/sir_charles_had_a_more_enjoyable_weekend_than_i/hdv25ni/,1,backpacking

Personally, if I were being paranoid about losing bags, I'd do this, regardless. *Most* of the time, you can pick your bag up at the jetway between flights. Sometimes they'll actually check it through to your final destination, however.

Either way, I've never lost a bag, including having them offloaded from a plane delayed 12 hours, and having them sent ahead on a flight that I was not able to get onto.

&amp;#x200B;

Non-vaccinated travelers on the rise: 58% of Americans that traveled abroad this summer were not vaccinated. As countries reopened their borders, non-vaccinated travelers returned to the same travel patterns as before COVID-19.

  
Old travelers on the rise: 42% of travelers were 18-25, followed by 25% who were 50+. Middle-aged families were unusually low.

  
Florida is the hub for unvaccinated travelers: 20% of unvaccinated American travelers live in the state of Florida.

  
Traveling is more expensive than ever: On average, Americans had to shell out an extra $330 in COVID-19 related entry restrictions when traveling abroad.

  
Traveling is inefficient: Each traveler spends more than 5 hours on determining entry requirements, and filling out paperwork.

My second luggage was just a regular airline piece of luggage and I took it as a carry-on and stuffed it with about 3 days worth. Be sure to put a couple different name tags on your bag or in them with contact info offering a reward if found, to deter people from simply stealing your contents or bag If it's unfortunately stolen rather than lost.

Crossing multiple borders in your own car involves mind-numbing amounts of paperwork; crossing multiple borders in a rental car won’t be allowed. The roads can be difficult, and there are also some roadless areas like the Darien Gap along the Panamanian/Colombian border, so you can’t drive directly through all of Latin America. A few countries (Honduras, El Salvador, likely Venezuela) are simply unsafe for tourism. 

Latin American public transport and taxis are vastly better and cheaper than the US version. Tourist hostels are cheap (not always cheaper than cheapest local hotels), generally safe, and often fun. 

Work part-time and summers, as much as you can. Learn Spanish and practice it.

The fuel canister is completely overkill; I acknowledged that in my OP.  It's what was available with all the supply chain shortages.

First time sleeping in a hammock. I traded in my tent for a hammock, table and chairs.

Favorite pieces of gear:

Helinox Chair One XL: I am a pretty big guy and found this chair to be extremely comfortable. This was a bit of a sludge for me but glad I made the purchase.

EDEUOEY Aluminum Folding Table: made sitting in the chair and preparing meals a breeze.

ThereMayBeDogsAbout,t2_78yb6pjm,"Well I don’t mean to be “gatekeeping” like you reference. Like yeah it’s annoying when people lie but it’s not the end of the world. Nature belongs to us all and it’s really infantile and peevish to get defensive about it. It deserves to be enjoyed no matter the size of a trip.. It’s just the 2nd and 3rd photo literally look like a picture I took upon driving around the park, before hiking thru. That winding escarpment I thought was a pull off by the road, because it honestly looks like a specific spot. But hey man! We both know that shit can look repetitive I’m not trying to be accusing you of ‘Reddit backpacking fraud’ or anything, I don’t think you’re a scum bag, it was just a “huh looks Familiar” moment. 

Anyway, I do think it is a little ignorant sounding to say it’s only “a little intense” as if I’m being super dramatic or something. Parts of the park are easier than others. Like this past June, I backpacked around the ENTIRE Shoshone lake in Yellowstone with 75 pounds and a Mossburg on my back. That was intense. Taking pictures of Old Faithful, not so intense. BUT exposing oneself to nature is what it’s all about, and like you said you had a child with you. Obviously you can’t be getting killed out there, but don’t go responding to all these comments with werewolf stuff implying that you are some kind of Badlands guru, when by your own admission this was a somewhat chill excursion. 

But yea none of this matters. Why are you responding 4 months later to my comment? Why am I responding to yours? Idk. At the end of the day “back packing” means some very different things to different people. Was my initial comment unnecessary? Yeah it was, sorry to sound rude I don’t mean that. I’m not a fan of some of your responses, but pfft it’s the internet. I’m glad you went, it’s an amazing place. I wish my father could have taken me to do stuff like that when I was a kid, so good on you for that. This isn’t a fun time to grow up with the Covid politics going on and I bet that experience is really impactful for your family.

StrawThree,t2_9tpv7ps8,"I’m a veteran, when I say something is a little intense, this is an opinion based on my experiences and because I’ve lived through much much worse, camping in a fucking park isn’t that bad.  Bring water, learn how to read a map and take care of the land you are on. No shooting snipers, no Nicaraguan drug farmers trying to kill me, zero Taliban oddly enough.  It’s a little intense, especially for those unaccustomed to being alone or who are not prepared. Don’t try to use landmarks solely as your method of navigation and you are fine.  Where I was earlier in my life, people died all the time…daily.  Quite ignorant of you to tell me my opinion on this is ignorant, don’t you agree?  I mean, it’s a beautiful dry park in the middle of America.  A bit of perspective.  If you don’t respect it, it’ll get you.  Maybe. Now quit trying to make up reasons to get your panties tangled.  I’m not a guru on anything BUT everyone of those posters acting like the Badlands are too tough for everyone and that they are more special than all of the “fakers” is mind boggling.  I was doing that shit when I was 15 and I’m no more skilled than the average backpacker.  Spend more time communing with nature and less on whatever manly hierarchy you think you need to move up on.

The community is generally welcoming and I’ll even go out on a limb here and say I’d bet 50 bucks that this guy here would be all smiles and welcoming if you were to run across him/her out in a park somewhere.  Fuck the gatekeepers, these experiences are here for everyone but please do not wander into one of these parks without doing your homework first. I’d rather lose an arguement on here than to think I accidentally got some kid killed who didn’t think he needed to respect the dangers of their environment.  But if you can walk far, carry some water and can sit alone with your own thoughts without going bonkers, do the homework and learn.  I personally carry a book from Readers Digest and I try to identify any animals or plants I run across that I didn’t know, it’s a great hobby for my children and myself, there is something spiritual about it.  So ya, I get mad.  No different than some jackass standing at the door of a church and barring people because HE doesn’t think you believe in Jesus enough.

People can see how normal people can become jackasses for a moment and resolve their differences peacefully, we need this way more.  Also, some of those pictures COULD be something you can drive up to.  I had kids as you read, they sorely wanted to see the prairie dog town and I spent more time there than I wanted to.  I didn’t leave off the roads until the sun was just about to set.  I think we hiked only a few hours the first day but surprisingly, my family made really good time for a group as large and diverse of age as we were.  Your trip around Shoshone sounds epic, I went to Yellowstone after we left the Badlands but the family didn’t want to rough it anymore plus, most of the trails were shutdown because of a bear attack that had just happened.

Blabbityblabby,t2_cl6yxdv7,"No need for a coupler if the little tube and big tube have somewhat similar sized openings. Just hold the two ends together like someone else mentioned and squeeze the big tube; little to no waste and less messy than a little jar. I have the coupler and one of those refillable tubes, but I found a smaller, thinner single-use travel sized toothpaste tube that fits in my bag better.

If both ends are clean before refilling, I figured reusing the little tube is not much grosser than swiping your toothbrush on the same big tube for several months at home.",1632076859,hdhtnas,t3_pr9r54,/r/backpacking/comments/pr9r54/refilling_your_standard_mini_toothpaste/hdhtnas/,2,backpacking

baesicscience,t2_3i68uq36,I lived in Saratoga Springs for a bit. It's about 3 hours by train from NYC. Just north of there are the Adirondacks which is an incredible area. Maybe you could take the train to Saratoga and then rent a car? Or look for group outings to join on Meetup? The Catskills are nice too but the Adirondacks are really special (and not full of rich people's vacation homes).,1632078906,hdhytzc,t1_hcq1efa,/r/backpacking/comments/pnb2fd/weekly_rbackpacking_beginner_question_thread_ask/hdhytzc/,1,backpacking

Heynony,t2_mjyja,"&gt; save up for a nice dehydrator

So many people buy inexpensive dehydrators and then move up that I have to think there are a lot of used ones around. Tag sales and such. You want a fan and a temperature control (NOT, for example, the old Ronco's which are for sale used all over the place). The modern trend is to put the heating element and fan on top, which I don't really understand.

A good budget one is the old FD-30 Harvest Maid Snack Master with the heating element and fan on the bottom. I see used ones on eBay for about $35 but if you could find one at a tag sale I bet $5 or $10 would do it. If you look at the pictures of it you may run across the same unit with different brand names and knock-offs with the same design which probably work just as well.

Frankly the ideal dehydrator would be the Alton Brown DIY design with two window fans strapped together with trays in between like a sandwich, because it's the moving air in huge volume you want more than the heat. But who has the room for that? You need heat in the consumer units because their tiny fans don't work fast enough and the food would spoil.",1631863869,hd6kao1,t1_hd64tex,/r/backpacking/comments/ppr1wd/anyone_else_all_about_the_gourmet_backcountry/hd6kao1/,3,backpacking

Top-Tundra,t2_bp0ffrg9,"I did a +40 mile, two night hike at Mt Hood last summer in a deluth backpack, measuring 13""W x 7½""D x 19""H (30L).  I hung my sleeping bag from my belt, which acted like a hip shelf for the backpack, which does not have a waist strap.

If I were to do it again I would have ditched the 3L camelback for two .75L smart waters, but the pack did great. No tent, but a large tarp, bug net, and Paracord. It rained on my second night and I was fairly miserable using the tarp for both a floor and roof, but I survived and had a great final day of hiking. 

So depending on how much food and comforts you bring, your pack will be cramped, but honestly you probably need less than you imagine. Extra clothes was only one cotton underwear and rayon socks. Extra equipment was a travel pillow, multitool, headlight, reflective survival blanket (which I used the rainy night and next morning), gloves, wet wipes, ziplock bag, salt, iodine tablets, and spoon. I'd bring a cheap poncho if I did it again. Being wet up high really drains you.

Food was some cooked beans and spam in a takeout tub and jar of peanut butter and a bottle of hot sauce. No bear requirements on this trip.

I've done some survival style hiking before, so maybe try a 12 mile, one night hike on your first time out. Stick to the trails and bring a map and compass for practice and emergencies.",1631879887,hd73q4n,t3_ppu4vy,/r/backpacking/comments/ppu4vy/travel_backpack_used_for_little_hike_have_you/hd73q4n/,1,backpacking

One time I was washing a knife in the kitchen and sliced my finger open pretty good. Lots of blood. I eventually get myself down to a 24/7 emergency clinic and they tell me it'll be $70 but what they'll use is essentially superglue. So instead I head to the nearest grocery store and grab some. Worked like a charm. 

I also remember working with an electrician at some point and he's sitting there with a knife stripping the insulation off some wires. He ends up really cutting himself with the knife... but instead of running to the medic and having file all that incident paperwork he just simply pulls out some superglue and closes the wound right up.",1631881782,hd770is,t1_hd6l5f1,/r/backpacking/comments/ppqgt8/any_suggestions_for_my_med_kit_5_night_solo_trip/hd770is/,3,backpacking

And by that standard, sure — now may not be the time for casual tourism.But for others, travel is a calling — something that brings us not just enjoyment, but meaning. For me, travel goes beyond mere “leisure.” Travel isn’t optional; it feeds my soul. I’ve devoted my career to travel not because it’s fun, but because it’s transformative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""**For me, that question — whether a place wants me to visit — is critical.** For example, the governor of Hawaii has discouraged tourists from visiting the islands for now. They are facing an acute crisis: When you’re running out of ICU beds, and the nearest capacity is a five-hour flight away, you can’t afford to take chances. And if a place is saying they don’t want me there, I’m not going.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""One in ten people on this planet derives their income from the travel industry. And it’s not just tour guides, flight attendants, and hotel desk clerks. It’s the farmers who supply restaurants, the engineers who design and build airplanes, the Lyft and Uber drivers making some extra cash with airport transfers. **At some point we will cross (or already have crossed) an imaginary line of “safe enough” to help these industries rebound.** It may feel cynical to boil travel ethics down to euros and cents, but for people who need those euros and cents, that’s no small consideration.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""And I think this is the way of the future. Taking the long view, I agree with experts who now recognize that this pandemic will never really “end” — at least, not the way we might’ve hoped. **COVID is gradually migrating from “pandemic” to “endemic”: Most likely, it will always be with us, floating around like common colds or the flu. The good news is that those miraculous vaccines have done exactly what they promised: For those who are vaccinated, they’ve turned COVID from a potential death sentence to a nuisance.""**

**TL;DR**\- This is his passion. He's only going to places that want/can handle tourists. He feels the need to help his friends abroad. The pandemic is now an endemic, it's never going to end.",1631885003,hd7db71,t3_pq02pt,/r/backpacking/comments/pq02pt/rick_steves_crew_traveling_again/hd7db71/,4,backpacking

Hope_Integrity,t2_5vbil9t0,"OK, I'll try.
Shoulder straps should be equal length, but they don't have to be. If your bag is unevenly loaded (bad idea) you may find uneven strap tension can help-but repack your bag. Or a back / shoulder injury may mean you consistently one run strap longer than another.

Shoulder blades comfy to the bag. Try lots of bags I really like osprey bags as they fit me very well but go to a real shop get some weight in them and try them on to see what fits. 

Your gait when carrying heavy will suffer. Dont use this as a template. You should walk with a pack very similarly to without unless something is wrong (bad pack, too heavy, etc) . Pack as light as possible 15kg / 30lb all in is very doable and the max I would tolerate- check out r/ultralight for this. 

Swinging / grabbing is fine. Get a framed pack with load lifters eg osprey rook and you will never need to do this again-though I still do occasionally to mix things up whilst walking. YouTube backpack fit videos to get an Idea here. 


Chest strap is simply there to keep the shoulder straps in a good comfy position. It shouldn't be tight it certainly doesn't take any load and it doesn't matter where it is. On some packs you might find your body keeps the shoulder straps in position well and you don't need one, but I once borrowed a pack without a chest strap and the straps wanted to slide off my shoulders. I spent the whole walk with one hand holding them in place. Not cool. 

Straps needing to be loosened to put on or take off a pack is normal, depending on the pack. One bag I loosen to put one, one I don't, one I loosen to take off and put on. 

Pelvis position is a hot topic. You will have to come to your own conclusions here but personally I think in the west our ideas of healthy backs is all wrong as evidenced by how many people have back pain. 

I try to strengthen and engage my core and keep my lower back straight with my pelvis rotated forward. But my natural urge is to bear all my weight through my spine with no core muscles coming into play and a hunched upper back.

I certainly wouldn't advocate leaning back whilst bearing load.",1631778916,hd1yydz,t3_poshdq,/r/backpacking/comments/poshdq/looking_for_a_real_answer_in_laymans_terms_about/hd1yydz/,1,backpacking

FWIW, we fit 3 average sized women and a dog in the Copper Spur UL2 and it was cozy but absolutely fine. I think a 2 person backpacking tent is completely adequate for 2 people on backpacking trip (especially if they’re a couple!) but I also understand why people would want a larger one.

Kananaskis_Country,t2_tanne,"With 4-5 months don't worry about seeing it all, just go with the flow. It's not as if you have to plan the itinerary in advance, simply start in Cancun and then work your way south. You'll end up where you end up, don't worry about it.

That said, if you're a fast traveler you can easily work your way down the Gringo Trail in that amount of time.

If you're a slow traveler then you'll likely fall in love with a few places and stay longer, thus making it impossible to get all the way south in your time frame.

No matter what happens you'll have a great time. Latin America is fabulous and offers loads of great experiences.

veritas723,t2_fyzqi,"the only way to meet new people is to meet them.    


my advice... see if there's any low threshold entry points.    Like...  i know REI  in nyc, would hold ... compass reading classes in the parks in the bronx,  or other really basic outings.   Then they would have little guided hikes to the super basic like... short train ride upstate hikes you can access from the city.    


I did one of those.  because I didn't have any hiking friends.  met a guy, his partner.  and they became good hiking/outdoorsy friends.    


I also had an old co-worker from a job i left like 10 yrs prior.  her IG was always... super dirt bag bike camping.   and I reached out to her,  sort of met for drinks, expressed how much I always wanted to try bike camping,  so went out a couple little outings with her and her friends.   was a lot of fun,  and made some friends into bike camping (turns out i hate bike camping... but i did enjoy the bike touring aspect)  


I tend to disagree that it's easy to convert friends.  i've never had much success with that.  I think people... will tolerate a bit of light hiking or camping.  but when you're talking multi-day hiking/camping trips.  that's a lot.   Someone has to want to be into that.     I would take my girlfriend to like...pretty waterfalls  or short like...maybe 4-5 loop trails.   other friends... same thing.  low inclines,  low technical threshold.       i think there's a huge barrier to having to actually shit in the woods.   a lot of people are just not into that.     


and to a degree.  you have to put yourself out there.   find organizations or opportunities to meet people.   it's not that easy.   but... like most things in life.  it's an effort and numbers game sort of adventure.   maybe not every effort will produce results.  but keep an open mind,  be open to meeting new people... put a positive effort forward.  and you'll attract like minded people.    if you put yourself out there. maybe...give a little more than you take... engage in events where meeting like minded folks is possible.  should find some kindreds",1631804842,hd353sf,t3_ppefgc,/r/backpacking/comments/ppefgc/how_to_find_backpacking_partners/hd353sf/,17,backpacking

Yo_Biff,t2_8kqtf6rz,"First time out and getting rained on constantly might not be the most fun experience.  However, if you are well prepared, it is not the end of the world.

My first backpacking trip was a 3 day, 30ish miles.  Temps were in the 90's, humidity was through the roof, and the mosquito population was insane.  It rained the second night into the third morning.  Definitely not ideal, but I still enjoy the memory of that inaugural trip and its challenges.  I think you have to ask yourself a couple questions.  

Are you ready to be wet consistently, especially your feet?  Good socks and footwear that you have used and know works for you is going to be a must.

Do you have the right clothing to stay warm, especially when you aren't actively hiking?  Hypothermia is no joke.

Are you ready to set up camp while getting wet?  It takes a little more time.

Is this going to challenge you past a point where you never want to do this again?  My girlfriend went on that first trip with me.  She'll day-hike whenever, but never backpack/overnight again.",1631706295,hcxtfk9,t3_pojzdi,/r/backpacking/comments/pojzdi/should_i_go_backpacking_in_the_rain_the_high/hcxtfk9/,2,backpacking

nonyabusiness123,t2_vb4qq,"Kentucky is a pretty middle of the road state. Parts of it are south, parts of it are north, and its pretty wide spanning left to right. Its easy for me to classify what's south...to me anything below 38 degree latitude would be officially south because the sun is strong enough there year round that you can make vitamin D from it, even in winter time. Not so much once you venture above that. Where I live, Louisville, is pretty much north and possibly Midwest. I would not classify eastern Kentucky, which is where the gorge lies, as the Midwest. Much of it is part of the appalachia mountains, and the topography is steep rolling hills, cliffs, and mountains which looks alot more like the Appalachian mideast. This is certainly true in the gorge. Once you get out to western KY especially bordering IN and IL, it starts to get quite flat in some regions and resemble the general topography of the Midwest. These areas of KY I would certainly classify as Midwest. So I'd say half the state is north and south, and part of the state is Midwest with a decent portion being mideast. Plus if you zoom out and look at a map of the entire US, most of the state falls to the right of center closer to the east coast. I'd say we're more of an Eastern state than anything.",1631625685,hctevth,t1_hctdogy,/r/backpacking/comments/pneqvi/red_river_gorge_2_nighter/hctevth/,1,backpacking
TboneXXIV,t2_3397rf75,"Well, my wife and I take turns on most of our trips &lt; 1 month just to keep our household and business running.  Since we both take trips this works out pretty well for fairness as well as having a partner that understands fully how much the home base operator has to just deal with the things that come up.  Big boy/girl pants are essential.

Now, when we've both gone (AT, 5 months) that was a whole new twist on things.  We had 4 cats at the time, one prone to UTIs.

We wound up getting a person to take care of them in exchange for reduced rent to live in our condo.  We cut down the rent by $600, for context.  Our kitties are pretty important to us and that's less than we'd pay for kenneling them plus they'd get to stay in their home albeit with a new person.  That was a big bonus, especially for UTI boy, who was easily stressed.  He was a lovable sweet boy who just had the unfortunate health issues that seem to crop up from overbreeding.

Getting the right person was super critical.  I had ads out a couple of months in advance.  I interviewed in 3 stages.  Internet, phone, in person.  

The person we wound up with was fantastic.  Conscientious, kind, stable, good communicator, very nice personality, etc.  Essentially, I was targeting the interviews just like I would for a potential adopter plus a potential renter.  When I found someone I believed was excellent for both, I selected her.  We adjusted several of our parameters to fit her as well because they were easy adjustments for us and it made things into an easier fit for her.  

I think a lot depends on what happens to your home while you are gone.  Will it be empty?  Will you just not have a place?  That sort of defines your options to even consider things like what we did.   In our case we owned that condo and while we eventually sold it that was several years after the AT trip.",1631625798,hctf4a5,t3_po1hh9,/r/backpacking/comments/po1hh9/for_those_that_have_pets_i_know_its_a_stupid/hctf4a5/,6,backpacking

So let's just say you'll need 5 cups boiling if you want to pour water into all the freeze dried meals at the same time. That's 1183ml. 4.5 liters =4500ml.  So unless you have some special requirement like everyone has to have a hot cocoa and a coffee and dinner at the exact same time, then I'd recommend bringing either a 1600ml or even just boiling twice.

L0ckt1ght,t2_ynz5u,"Hey all! I'm going to do devil's path this Friday/sat, looking at 14miles the 1st day and the remaining ~10 the second. I'm not a stranger to the woods or backpacking, but this will be the longest hike I've done by a long shot (miles not time in the woods). (Longest was old rag in Shenandoah, VA, 9-10 miles and 2600' elevation gain and loss).

I'll be under 30lbs on the pack weight fully loaded, and have a bail plan where the trail crosses over the road. I also have gps/communicator so I'm not worried about getting lost and will be able to text.

I guess what I'm worried about is usually I'm the strongest hiker in my group, and I have a slower pace cause I like to wander and mosey. So it's not an issue for me to go with weaker hikers (acting kinda like a guide in those cases). This is will be the first hike where I'm the weakest hiker with the slowest pace.

sindersins,t2_yfft3,"Different jobs have different levels of flexibility and different vacation structures. 

For example:

Some people can work from anywhere with an internet connection. Doesn’t work for backcountry camping, but certainly applicable for traveling. 

Some people (millions in the US alone) are teachers with 2 - 3 months off in the summer, or have other jobs with lots of vacation and/or down time.  

Some people work jobs that let them retire with excellent pensions after 20-30 years (cops and firefighters, for example) so you’ve got hundreds of thousands—or perhaps even millions—of retired folks in their 40s and 50s. 

Many people are unemployed. 10s of millions of them, in fact. Most of those folks aren’t likely to be in a financial position for travel / camping, but many are. 

Some folks have jobs that are essentially fungible (service industry, retail, etc.), so can feel free to quit, live off meager savings for awhile, then get another job when they run out of money. 

Some folks have family money and just plain don’t need to work.

Kananaskis_Country,t2_tanne,"For long term travel - *especially* to destinations that are super popular with budget backpackers - here's the first thing you can safely do: Throw away your travel itinerary.

Thailand is the most popular backpacker destination on the planet and that has been the case for decades. It's a fantastic place for a first timer to ""learn"" how to travel. It's cheap, safe and completely non-threatening while still being utterly foreign to what you're used to. Most importantly its popularity means its tourist infrastructure is incredible so it's super easy for you to learn the ropes about backpacking travel.

Once you gain a little confidence and start to get itchy for new experiences then you can decide to move on. Some places you'll love and you'll want to settle in an extended stay, other places just won't do it for you and you'll move on faster. Another huge factor is that once you hit the road you'll discover loads of places that you've never heard of and you'll decide last minute to give them a try.

Bottom line: The secret of long term travel is to be totally flexible and most importantly realize that an itinerary/schedule is the last thing you have to worry about. You have the rare gift of time and that's a wonderful thing.

If you swing by Hanoi drop me a line and I'll introduce you to the cheapest beer in the world.

acadianabites,t2_6ysowwbj,"I don’t think what you’re looking for exists at this point in time. 

It would be really nice to have a wilderness GPS that works just like a car GPS or could tell you to go right or left if you get off track, but satellite technology has its limitations. If you and a friend walk the exact same trail and use a breadcrumb feature to track it, there’s a good chance you’ll have different elevation gain/loss and other variations in positioning. This doesn’t mean these devices aren’t useful, it just means that you have to take this margin of error into account when using them. If you’re hiking in dense forest, this makes a GPS unit even less reliable. 

I don’t know if this is a limitation of Gaia specifically or all GPS apps/devices, but I’ve tried to plot a point to point route on Gaia while offline and it’s not something you can do. 

I think you just have to accept that there’s always going to be an element of uncertainty when you’re in unfamiliar territory in the backcountry, and personally I think that’s part of what makes walking through these places so exciting. Learn how to use a map and compass and just trust yourself. I also find that constantly glancing at a GPS unit might make me feel better about what direction I’m heading in, but it takes away from the experience a little. I find myself focusing so much on the destination that it takes away from the journey. Just my 2 cents though!",1631346603,hceua6l,t3_plo1vy,/r/backpacking/comments/plo1vy/minimalist_gps/hceua6l/,1,backpacking

ShenmeNamaeSollich,t2_1pny6ssk,"Sawtooths are supposed to be that cold already *this* coming week … 

In a couple more weeks it *might* only get down to 25-30F and stay clear … 

Or it might hit 16F and dump a few feet of snow on you … 

Or it might rain all day down low during your hike before you hit a higher-elevation camp in the snow &amp; really need to dry out after a sweaty quasi-snow-shoe trek. 

Or both. 

You never know, so you want some buffer to ensure you can *warm back up* from a deficit. Starting out 25 degrees in the hole is not ideal. 

Camped Alice Lake a few years ago in October, other spots in the area in Sept for a few years, Cascades in Oct before that. Temps ranged from 18ish-30ish. 

Last 2mi to Alice was in the snow. Once the sun dropped after a 60F day of hiking, temps crashed to low 20s &amp; fingers and faces got numb quickly even w/heavy gloves on.

I have a 20F down quilt (that I need to send in to have restuffed for lower temps), a poly/silk liner for another ~5F, and decent sleeping pad that’s like a 4.5 R-value. 

Spouse also has a 20F (I think) down bag &amp; we basically sleep close together zipping both bags open/together for warmth. 

We sleep in long underwear, down vests &amp; fleece/knit hats. Thin gloves sometimes as needed. 

On some trips we haul a separate fuzzy ground blanket due to expected low temps. That’s probably the biggest help. Lots of added bulk &amp; weight, but *most* of the time we’re super toasty by keeping that extra floofy layer between us and the ground. Sometimes it’s just damn cold out. 

I think our next purchase will be a 0F couples down bag …",1631348874,hcewrkw,t3_plzem4,/r/backpacking/comments/plzem4/50f_sleeping_bag_in_30f_weather/hcewrkw/,2,backpacking

branzalia,t2_32iry6zd,"It's not too late.  But it's also probably the wrong time.  I had a RTW trip cut short after 4.5 months due to covid and am waiting for things to settle down before I try again.  Things aren't going to change much in a few months and you're going to be fairly limited where you can go.  So, maybe consider getting a job for a while and build up a financial buffer that you will absolutely need if you travel widely.  My last RTW trip had an extra $10k added to it due to unexpected circumstances.

The other thing it temper your digital nomad dreams.  It's the sort of thing that a select few make work (and they all seem to blog about it) even though it's often portrayed as something that nearly anyone with a passion can do.  It's not.  In all my travels, there have been very, very few I've met who've been able to do it.  It sounds better than it really is.

A better idea is to work for a while, save a lot, and then enjoy your travels completely.  Not sure of your field but are contract jobs an opportunity?  Why not work for three years and then travel for two?  I didn't get a ""real job"" until I was your age but since then, have spent less than 50% of the time working but when I do work, make decent money and enjoy the travel time.  This is a much more probable path than a digital nomad.",1631382089,hcgirly,t1_hcd3oyn,/r/backpacking/comments/piv2ge/weekly_rbackpacking_beginner_question_thread_ask/hcgirly/,1,backpacking

If you want the work to be part of your experience, than this may work for you.  New Zealand and Australia have special arrangements for UK citizens although you can't travel there for the foreseeable future.  I met tons of people picking fruit in NZ but it's hard work and generally doesn't pay well.  Countries are usually pretty stingy giving away their good jobs to foreign people so you can't count on making a lot. 

You can travel long term on a budget but it will take some learning if it's the first time traveling.  My usual advice is work for a few years and save like crazy.

Standing_At_The_Edge,t2_21jmb7ql,"From what I understand the TSA requires that there be no Vapours or residue on the stove.  The thing about your type of stove is that they don’t have a means of holding vapour or residue.  I believe that this rule relates more to the MSR whisperlite stoves that have a self contained bottle that you pressurize.  That type of canister is a part of the stove and could hold vapour.  

Because your stove uses a 3rd party pressurized canister (which you can’t fly with) your stove on its own is safe to fly.

To be safe use soapy water to wash the stove down - don’t submerge it, rather just give it a good wipe and the dry it.

Hope this helps.  And enjoy your trip",1631285528,hcbh0vq,t3_plly8t,/r/backpacking/comments/plly8t/how_do_i_clean_msr_windburner_stove_for_airport/hcbh0vq/,2,backpacking

xtiansimon,t2_3pz7j,"Your question as written is over-broad, so I will try to orient you towards further research.

**How long will you be hiking or camping?**

For short trips (day trip or overnight), a current weather report will have a higher likelihood of predicting the different weather events you will encounter. If you have just a single night, and you're camping in a well marked area, then the worst situation you will encounter is a wet and sleepless night. Longer trips require more planning and preparation. 

**Where will you be hiking or camping?** 

If you're hiking in, say, California's _coastal ranges_ you can enjoy a perfectly moderate day-nighttime temperature shift. If on the other hand you venture into the High Sierra, or one of several desert regions, you will find day time and overnight temperatures vary in the extreme. To be comfortable and safe you need to be prepared.

Different regions also have different flora and fauna. Is there poison Ivy or Poison Oak in your region? You need to understand what types of pests and animals you may encounter such as ticks or snakes. This will determine if you should be wearing long pants and not shorts, and sturdy boots, and not hiking sandals.

**What activities will you be participating in?**

If you're car camping in a designated camp site within a National or State Park, then you have one situation. You could mostly wear anything you would wear in the city. Your clothes will become dirty, but will otherwise perform just fine. And if you are uncomfortable, well the car is right there and you can leave if you learn you really didn't prepare well. 

At the other extreme is backpacking in a National Wilderness. You want clothes which are not too bulky. Space in your backpack is limited, and each ounce is just more weight on your back. What's more, you will take care choosing each garment for its materials and features. When exercising as with hiking, you will want a 'base layer' of 'wicking' fabrics to help move moisture away from your body. When you're in the wilderness, as opposed to exercising in your town, you have different long term needs. In the wilderness you need to keep warm if it's cold, and cool if it's hot. If you're going for a longer backpacking trip and expect to encounter diverse weather conditions such as rain, then high-tech clothing constructed of Gore-Tex would be a common recommendation. High-tech clothing is not only constructed of performance materials, they also have very smart features. For example, 'pit-zips' are vents under your armpits to help reduce overheating while still protecting you from the rain.

**General topics for clothing**

- layering
- base layer
- shell layer
- wicking fabrics
- light color fabrics. Recently I was reminded of the problem with ticks. Light color fabrics help you spot these potentially disease carrying bugs.

These are just a few orienting topics for further research and questions. I encourage you to read up on the subject at your public library. There are a vast number of publications from the 1970s about camping and backpacking, as the environmental movement of that time created greater appreciation for the outdoors.

Another source are publications from the Boy Scouts. For example, J.E. West and W. Hillcourt. Fieldbook for boy scouts, explorers, scouters, educators [and] outdoorsmen. Boy Scounts of America (1945) 1967
(https://archive.org/details/fieldbookforboys00boys)

I'm sure the Girl Scouts have their own educational publications, but I'm not familiar with these. I wasn't a Girl Scout.

3. Chinese food. No joke I have gotten food poisoning from two different Chinese restaurants in Berlin and San Francisco.

Complex_Lingonberry2,t2_7m7gt2hs,"Welcome! :) 

Over the years I tried different systems and a couple of years ago I decided not to use collapsible bottles and water bladders anymore, but that's my own preference. I find both not that easy to clean after all, compared to other bottles. 

This being said, back when I was using them, I preferred the collapsible bottles because I could see how much water I had left / had been drinking and I agree with you about the water bladder potentially leaking. Mines never did, but in the back of my mind I was always a bit worried they could leak. I also found collapsible bottles easier to use with filters and to refill at public taps, like for example along the Camino de Santiago or other similar trails. Overall, I find a collapsible bottle is more practical to handle than a bladder. But again... this is personal preference. 

I guess your choice will also depend on the type of trails you go to and the type of water sources. I'm sure many others here will have interesting and useful experiences to share.",1631122222,hc2zgoo,t3_pkertd,/r/backpacking/comments/pkertd/collapsible_bottles_vs_water_bladders_i_need/hc2zgoo/,2,backpacking

Saw some of the largest bull elk I’ve ever seen.
Take caution when getting out there at night. We were all very tired after driving for three days and it was a jolt of adrenaline seeing so many animals pop out.

Also for anyone going, leave yourself water to come back to. You can’t refill along the trail and there’s nothing at the trailhead (hilltop).

schlankykitty,t2_4evowid0,"I use a combination. On most trips, I have a 32 oz wide mouth Nalgene (non-collapsible) bottle in one side pocket and a 1 liter collapsible bottle in the other outside pocket. That starting amount of water will generally will get me to most campsites I use, but YMMV.

I carry larger 2 liter bladders (empty) in my pack to use for water storage at camp. I hate filtering water and prefer to just do a bunch at one time if I have a good source near camp and not have to worry about it again.

On trips with bigger miles or hotter days, I use two collapsible bottles in side pockets of my pack and ditch the Nalgene bottle. I use a drink tube so I don't have to stop as much for water. When one bladder runs dry, I just switch the tube over to the other bottle. Over time, I find I used the drink hose less often and just make a quick stop to drink.

I use Platypus collapsible bottles and bladders and drink tube. They're all easy to clean if you do it right after a trip, but they're a pain to get completely dry.",1631123832,hc33er3,t3_pkertd,/r/backpacking/comments/pkertd/collapsible_bottles_vs_water_bladders_i_need/hc33er3/,0,backpacking

ObamasLoveChild,t2_hjn9i,"The Balkan countries were beautiful, but oftentimes, a little hit-or-miss when it came to the people. Albania had some incredibly welcoming people, but passing through Montenegro, I found myself feeling very unwelcome, and the people to be generally cold towards foreigners. I summited Montenegro's tallest peak and then was out of there on a bus to Bosnia as soon as I could. Bosnia turned out to be much more warm, both in temperature and in people. As soon as I got off at the bus stop in Sarajevo, I was offered a ride into the city center by a local who was on the same bus as me.

It did not take long for me to feel at home in Bosnia. Throw in some incredible natural beauty and villages like Mostar pictured here, and you've got yourself one of the most severely underrated travel destinations in Europe.

It was my first 14er so I definitely noticed the elevation. Total the hike was just over 20 miles and 7,500 ft elevation gain according to my watch. If you have a good off road vehicle you can drive much further up the road (disclaimer this is for serious off road vehicles only). Bring copious amounts of water and make sure to have a filter. First ~6 miles have no water and are very hot in the summer. I'd highly recommend this hike, but being one of the tallest 14ers, it is not for the front of heart.

CBML50,t2_io02y,"I don't have the route saved, unfortunately! my friend made it and I seem to have deleted the map since.

we started at [deam lake](https://www.in.gov/dnr/forestry/files/or-ktsouth.pdf). there's a backpacker's overnight parking area there, it's like $5-10 to park. We did stash water at Bartle Knob road where the trail crosses the road, we'd heard that summer can be iffy with water and didn't want to end up without. Water sources were fine (passed one about 3miles and then camped near another) but these are smaller streams, so depending on how wet or dry it has been, you might do the same.

It was a decent amount of elevation change. It was also like 80F and humid, so felt even worse. The climb up Bartle Knob and Round Knob back to back was draining. Ended up camping about 8 miles in down in a little valley near a stream. there was an established site there, there's actually a lot of established sites - probably ever 1/2 mile or so we'd pass one or two. 

Looped back around on some horse trails in Clark state forest the next day, avoiding going over Round Knob again but rejoining the knobstone before bartle knob heading south. 

Not sure how it is this time of year, but the biggest issue aside from heat and potential dry water sources was ticks. my friend pulled over 100 off their dog.

jorwyn,t2_52yf2,"When I was younger and much more fit (1994), I heard about the continental divide trail and decided I had to do it. I didn't have much money, and a lot of the ultralight gear we have now didn't exist yet, or I couldn't find any. So, I practiced with a canvas and aluminum frame back literally filled with weights from my friend's weight lifting set he'd given up on. I weighed 109lbs the day I got on a bus to go to the Mexican start point in late March. My pack weighed 71. I'd trained for 85, so it actually didn't seem that bad at first. I was also wearing heavy AF logging style boots with metal shanks and steel toes. (1/10, would not recommend). As I ate and drank, the pack got lighter, but that honestly only made me nervous. The first week, I made decent time, actually exceeding my goals by a few miles each day. I was high on life. Then, that high wore off a bit and I absolutely hated that pack and the weight. I lost every extra mile and then some. I worried I would not make it before the Autumn snows in the northern mountains. At the first trail town, a segment hiker actually gifted me his lighter tent and bag, dropping 6 pounds. I did the rest of the ""trail"" at about that weight. Though the last two weeks were spent a little heavier with the addition of some also gifted snowshoes. I finished on my 20th birthday, October 3. I weighed 115, and my gear (with what little food and water I had left) weighed in at 59. 

Along the way, I lost all but one extra pair of socks and the clothing I was in plus my cold weather gear when I stupidly went to grab food while my stuff finished in a dryer at a laundromat. I came back to everything gone but one pair of underwear. I dropped my ski poles I was using as trekking poles down a ravine and couldn't find them, so I gained a walking stick made from a fallen branch. I had calluses from my pack straps so thick, it took most of a year for them to go away. A woman at a church I did some work for over a few days for money and food traded me my awful boots for actual hiking boots she had only worn a few times. She also tsked at my food choices and loaded me up with a bunch of packets of dehydrated food that was much lighter. That was somewhere in Colorado. 

I have no regrets, but would I do it differently given another chance at being that age right now? Yes, yes I would. My pack build staying under 40 lbs would be my first priority. Trekking poles with straps would be on the list, too, and camp shoes! And more training on steep and rough terrain with an 80lb pack first.",1630834548,hbo4hza,t3_pi2mfs,/r/backpacking/comments/pi2mfs/whats_the_heaviest_gear_youve_taken_backpacking/hbo4hza/,1,backpacking
jorwyn,t2_52yf2,That's where I lived before I started my continental divide trail through hike. It was second nature to pack a ton of water. I think a good 1/4 of my pack weight was water to start out. Also filters? This was 1994. We had tablets. I finished that trip immensely thankful to all the trail angels who left water. And that blessed day I found a cooler (with ice) full of slushy otter pops and bags of M&amp;Ms.,1630834823,hbo4skf,t1_hbni6xp,/r/backpacking/comments/pi2mfs/whats_the_heaviest_gear_youve_taken_backpacking/hbo4skf/,2,backpacking

jorwyn,t2_52yf2,"Went hiking in the mountains along the Idaho/Canada border in late Spring (for there) because it was too hot at my house 3hrs from there. Told myself I knew what I was doing. I knew how to test the snow. No cell phone signal. Hiking alone. Didn't tell anyone where I would be, either, of course. Because I was a dumb ass. 

At some point, I proved to myself I didn't know how to test the snow. The shelf of it I was sure was securely packed onto the trail gave way and I fell about 50 feet down the mountain and stopped by smashing my knee into a sharp boulder with all my weight behind it. Gashed knee bleeding everywhere. No issues, right? I have a first aid kit! Flushed it. Oh, I can see the edge of the bone. Wait. That shouldn't be the edge of my patella. Yep, cracked that sucker in half. Spent the next 3 hrs belly crawling back to the trail with the blood leaving a nice track as it soaked through every bit of gauze I had. 

I did get lucky, though. Some other hikers came by giving each other crap about how late it was. They took turns carrying me to a trailhead where their car was and drove me to a clinic in a town in Canada. So, now I guess I've illegally crossed the border, too. The clinic sent me to a nearby hospital, and those guys went with. After I was as patched up as I could be for the moment, they actually let me stay the night in one of their beds while that guy took the couch and then drove me back across the border to my car, and then one of them drove my car the 3 hrs to my house. 

I learned some lessons that day. 1) I'm an idiot and should try to be less of one. 2) the Canadian healthcare system is amazing in emergency, even if you're not from there. 3) If I'm going to be an idiot and break my left knee cap, I should probably not own a stick shift with a very stiff clutch.

Things unwound a bit and it became a family trip which was awesome. However I didn’t want to have my family’s first Sierra trip be the CR for 5 nights. So I switched to this permit last minute. No problem getting it. In fact - I’d dare to say you can secure Snow Creek out of the valley almost all the time. It allows access to a lot of the park if you are willing to log the miles.

legogirl,t2_5yipf,"For clarity, I’ve been hiking and camping solo for 25 years. This is just my first time backpacking. I also chose an area I was super familiar with and day hiked and camped before - so I knew all the WiFi spots and how to get out quickly if I needed to. I also don’t recommend inexperienced people just go out without a lot of prep work. 

But I also recommend that if people don’t have people in their lives to do this with… don’t let it stop you from living your life the way you want. If solo is how it has to happen, do your prep work, know your area, know your limits, and then go for it.",1630843443,hbof7fa,t1_hbnkq6h,/r/backpacking/comments/phw82h/first_trip_success/hbof7fa/,1,backpacking

madsci,t2_s3v2,"&gt;You’re packing your fears for sure. We all do it. 

I'm just getting into it, but this is particularly hard for me. My background is with search and rescue. I got into an explorer team at age 14-18, then later went on to the local SAR academy and joined the county team.

Almost every time I've been backpacking has been for SAR training or at least with the SAR team. I've never *done* regular recreational backpacking before. I always had a 40+ pound pack without any overnight gear except an emergency bivvy.

It wasn't packing fears because every time we were out it was in response to someone's fears coming true. It's a totally different mindset. My gut feeling on how prepared I should be is massively skewed in the conservative direction, and I have to keep convincing myself that it's OK to equip myself at an equal level to other recreational backpackers. Like I still have trouble feeling safe wearing trail runners and not combat boots and reminding myself I'm not going to have to jump out of any helicopters.",1630736299,hbjh6gk,t1_hbixwtp,/r/backpacking/comments/phhukf/tb_to_my_very_first_backpacking_trip_4_days_in/hbjh6gk/,20,backpacking

I shouldn’t have necessarily said the past doesnt concern me, more that for the purposes of understanding that it doesn’t *stop* it can’t concern me *too much*. Make sense? As in, if I’m resting my every opinion about religion based on its past, I set myself up for a false feeling of superiority and therefore become capable of making the same mistakes. It’s important to *know* that history, but it’s also important to hold in my heart that I’m capable of the same actions.

ComprehensiveElk884,t2_6gr1gk74,"My first big hike I just spent my first night in jail for being a little too intoxicated and refused to show my I’d to the cops.  When I got out I was devastated thought my life was over so I hiked 95 or so miles in 5 days.  My pack was super heavy and I was like you overweight.  I dropped 30 lbs on that hike through a combination of head down constant walking, very little food and colder temps.  I’m a very firm believer that your mind can absolutely take your physical body further, higher, faster than you thought.  I’ve kept the weight off for years now and never felt more fit than when I hike even when I’ve worked out my whole life.  I suppose I’m a masochist too in some ways as when I hike, I want it to be tough and push me to that point what I grow from not only the beautiful experience but the knowledge that I pushed hard, struggled, felt very uncomfortable and relied only on myself.  If I don’t do X or Y then I might not make it home, might get very cold, wet, hot, etc so I force myself to not be lazy and for good reason.  This hobby or lifestyle of backpacking/hiking is a combination of physical fitness and seeing places that could soon be gone, lost to commercial progress.  I always keep my eyes, ears, mind and heart wide open on the trail cause that’s how I heal, grow and these days get up in the morning.

legogirl,t2_5yipf,"I got to spend 4 days on the Colorado Trail this week for my first backpacking trip (and I got to do it solo!) I’ve wanted to do this for a few years and finally got the guts to try. It was a massive success!! I did spend the first day thinking of all the ways my pack could be lighter but all in all, it was great. I ended up doing an out and back, hitting segments 3 and 4, totaling about 50 miles over 4 days. 

I have one question… in that time, I could feel my legs getting stronger for the pack weight, but my feet were getting progressively more sore. No blisters or raw spots - just swelling and bruised feeling. How long does it take before your feet get tougher? I’m a pretty avid hiker, but multiple days with the extra weight was too much.

blurrrrg,t2_a8dren3r,"Wanted to do the Telluride Via Ferrata. It's basically a hidden path along the side of a canyon near some old mines where you have harnesses and stuff to not die. Anyways, after spending the whole day lost, looking for the trail, I finally stopped in a hiking store to get directions. They told me where it was and to be careful because of the weather and I went on my way.

By the time I found the trail head, it was the late afternoon and storms were rolling in. But I'd literally driven thousands of miles to do this, I wasn't giving up. I completed the via Ferrata, and at the end of the trail, I decided to keep walking to a waterfall I could hear instead of turning around. I quickly realized that I had no clue where the start of the trail back was. So I'm up on the side of a mountain, lost, with thunderstorms rolling in.

To get ""unlost"" I essentially slipped/rolled down the side of the mountain until I could find a clearing in the trees and was able to sort of figure out the way to my car, just in time for the thunderstorms, flooding, and minor landslides to begin.",1630785152,hblsuqh,t3_phxcl5,/r/backpacking/comments/phxcl5/story_time_whats_the_dumbest_thing_youve_done_on/hblsuqh/,19,backpacking

evanhinosikkhitabbam,t2_cihu9kok,"Thanks so much for the comments, which merits a thoughtful reply. To start, I think I can relate and empathize; I'm sure a lot of us can as a matter of fact. These wilderness areas and gems of the natural world really are incredibly special and mean so much to so many people. And we have it so good in Cali, and still do.

For a lot of us and for good reason, these areas are places of wonder, awe, beauty, serenity, and perhaps even ecstasy and transcendence. They comprise our fondest memories and must meaningful narratives of nature and in large part define our very lived experience of nature. 

When I think of and set foot in majestic places I hold dear like the Sierra Nevada, Big Sur, and redwood country (Santa Cruz but also Humboldt on up to Del Norte), they are inextricably linked to the experiences and memories I have of these places, shared with people I know and love and often accompanied by long miles, type 2 fun (pain in the moment and fun after the fact), stunning views, campfires, and the vast starry night sky above us.

So of course there's going to be a sense of loss and grief and sorrow when we feel as though these places have been changed, corrupted, devastated, or otherwise lost or made inaccessible to us in some way. Just as we have extended families, so too do we have extended homes.

Case in point: Last year my ex and I were going to go camping at Big Basin SP and trail running along the Skyline to the Sea literally just a few days before the CZU Complex Fire swept through the area. I didn't think I'd be so affected by this and yet I was, in a deep visceral way, like losing an old friend or a beloved animal companion, right? 

And yet we grief, celebrate, reflect, give back, and carry on without having to move on. Or to paraphrase Robert Nesta Marley, we've been here before and we will come again. Suffering and loss transmuted into wisdom and compassion is an appropriate way forward in a world full of broken beings and broken places.",1630652277,hbf2suc,t3_pfx7sz,/r/backpacking/comments/pfx7sz/my_simple_homage_to_desolation_wilderness_lake/hbf2suc/,1,backpacking

Since the late 300s BC the name Cappadocia came to be restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), Upper Cappadocia, which alone will be the focus of this article.

plups,t2_cvdmg,"There are different levels of habituation. There's an interesting version of this in Africa - elephants that have been hunted are much more likely to go mental and charge a tourist car, endangering people in it, same with people on foot. Elephants that have not been hunted in generations are calm and don't do this, simply ignoring or keeping a small distance away. 

What I'm saying is that places where animals are not shit scared of humans are actually really quite rare, on a global scale.

hikehikebaby,t2_bcce6cch,"Look I'm sorry but this is getting to be completely ridiculous.

We know we have an overpopulation of moose because we can compare to historic levels and because we can look at the effects moose have on the rest of the ecosystem including over browsing. This information is the developed by actual scientist based on actual data it isn't made because someone decided they hate moves and want to shoot them. Overpopulation is extremely serious and has extremely negative effects for the entire ecosystem and every plant/animal in it.

""But x is also dangerous"" isn't an argument. I'm not talking about elephants in Africa, I'm talking about extremely well regulated and well researched hunting in North America where there are competent and strong governments with the ability to enforce regulations. Moose are very dangerous and it's incredibly dangerous for them to be habituated to people. The last thing I give a crap about or whether or not people like to take pictures of animals they shouldn't be anywhere near. The same goes for bears - everyone thinks it's fun to see a bear and get close to it but that doesn't mean that it's safe for you or for the bear.

I don't hunt, this isn't about my personal enjoyment. I'm an environmental scientist and I'm telling you that hunting is necessary for the greater good because we have no other population control for a lot of animals. If we don't hunt them then they first remove all food sources for themselves and everything else and then they die of starvation. Overcrowding also leads to zoonotic illness.

There are a lot of good arguments against hunting but ""people liked it when the animal was dangerously and inappropriately habituated to them"" isn't one of them.",1630584938,hbb1xs6,t1_hbao933,/r/backpacking/comments/pfkvtg/not_sure_how_well_received_this_will_be_in_this/hbb1xs6/,2,backpacking

plups,t2_cvdmg,"Ah sorry, I should have phrased better - what factors have led to an overpopulation of moose? Is it perhaps the legal hunting of predators? I'm familiar with the overpopulation issues, more just trying to understand how this happened in the first place from an admittedly assumed starting point of dynamic equilibrium. 

I dont doubt that a lot of research has gone into it, but it's also possible that some parties have a vested interest in certain conclusions. Bias may be minimal of course, and I'm not suggesting there's a huge conspiracy or anything, but an organisation asking the question ""how much can we hunt without it going badly?"" will reach a different answer to one asking ""should we hunt at all?"".

Bearing in mind that i wasn't being specific about Moose, just wildlife generally, my point stands, that it's a dick move to specifically seek out places where people have a meaningful and non harmful interaction with wildlife, in order to hunt that wildlife.

What: This is a six to eight day, 75km hike down the coast of Vancouver island on the pacific coast. It is globally renowned to be one of the top 10 hikes in the world, and for good reason.

Da_Rabbit_Hammer,t2_8xn2aikt,"I like dehydrating individual ingredients for certain things but find whole meals are sort of limited in what turns out well. It takes some experiments to find what stuff rehydrates at a similar rate so nothing is crunchy and nothing falls apart to mush. 

I prefer the individual ingredients method over the whole meal dehydrated at once thing. I also will then do a lot of #10 cans of freeze dried stuff as it rehydrates better, is way easier, and isn’t crazy expensive. Especially when you realize the energy cost to dehydrate in similar amounts. Buy a #10 can of freeze dried peas for 20$ and you have dozens of meals with peas waiting. Bite the bullet and buy a #10 can of ground beef for 50$ and it’ll last months in the woods. To do the same amount in a dehydrator, at least without a commercial dehydrator, and you are running your dehydrator 24 hours a day for a week straight. 

Can separate different portions of the meal into what will rehydrate similarly then. I do all freezer bag, in the pot, or even a combo there of. Boil water for things that will rehydrate well and dump the water in the bag leaving my pot now open to boil the stuff that takes a bit more to rehydrate. Mashed potatoes flakes with a freezer dried veggie in a freezer bag, and a gravy with a protein boiling away in the pot, etc… 

As far as whole meals go it’s all the same stuff. You’ll see the same recipes everywhere. Chili works but the extra effort doesn’t produce anything better or cheaper than bear creek soup. Simple curry type stuff rehydrates ok, but always seems underwhelming in my opinion. Noodles turn out mushy so I prefer to just do pasta sauce “bark” and cook my own noodles right at camp. Didn’t like the all in one spaghetti method. Over all I think “barks” are the way to go. Cook and purée whatever it is then use it as a sauce for instant rice, noodles, etc… 

A lot of other stuff works out ok but you need to plan in time to cold soak it before cooking it or you just waste a ton of fuel boiling whatever it is for 30 mins to get your carrots rehydrated or something. 

Eh… got a bit rambly there. I guess the main point I’m trying to make is one, freezer bags, and two, it may take a lot of experimentation to find what you like/ what is “worth it” for the time invested.

I don't like hunters because I'm from russia. There is not too much animals in the wilderness near cities compared to nearby europian countries where even in central park you can meet rabbits. I'm hiking and backpacking for around 5 years now and saw a couple of rabbits and boars once. And there are too many hunters. And some of them are humenless completely. Often it's some sort of entertainment for rich people and for government officials. They obey no law and will not have any responsibilities for their actions. Recently there was a news that some hunters killed 56 deers while they were crossing the river. And here is a proud killer of 200 birds. https://www.instagram.com/p/CPCQ_Kor5nc/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=13f61f68-51bd-41fa-b1aa-e1e7323afa80

Fortunately we also have a huge deer population (managed and protected by money generated from hunting licenses) so this isn't as difficult as it sounds.

Where OP is hunting, vegetation, and also the deer population, is much more sparse, so game needs to be taken at much longer ranges, but typically you have magnifying optics on the gun to compensate for the distance, and again, you use the terrain to eliminate the chance of hitting someone or something else if you miss.

In either case, there is essentially no risk of an experienced and ethical hunter shooting a human unless it's maybe two kids in a REALLY convincing one of those front and back half deer costumes where the front person is the head and the back person holds onto their waist.

Accident do happen, generally because inexperienced hunters get too excited about harvesting their first animal and get tunnel vision, or because drunken backwater assholes just don't care. For these reasons, we have additional laws to mitigate risk. For instance, where I live, only shotguns and large caliber straight walled cartridges may be used to take deer. This is partly to reduce the chance of wounding but not killing an animal, but also because these firearms have lots of power but very short falloff distances which reduces the risk if an excited hunter shoots at a deer without a safe backdrop.",1630499145,hb6gght,t1_hb6bjoz,/r/backpacking/comments/pfkvtg/not_sure_how_well_received_this_will_be_in_this/hb6gght/,18,backpacking

You could also look at the golden triangle in India, Peru including Machu Picchu or the east coast of China. I know people who have done guided tours through all of these and really enjoyed it. Not too sure on their COVID situations however, though India may be unlikely. 

Though the weather won’t be warm like you wanted, Canada could work as it has a huge backpacker community so tours and other backpackers will be easy to find. The States has the Amtrak train system or Greyhound buses that I believe offer hop-on/hop-off tickets.

Comfortable-Agency58,t2_e8xyz9hr,"I remember I did a solo backpacking trip but it was just for 1 night. I found a place to set up my tent after a few miles into the Mojave Desert and nestled next to a giant boulder. I climbed up that boulder to watch the sunset. I cried uncontrollably while up there, speaking dreams that I wished to achieve in my lifetime. I have not met all of them yet though. Those tears were both relieving and electrifying. It reminded me of how human I was but also how odd I was at the same time. I felt like the outlier among variables and I felt like my inner thoughts would not have a seat in my communities. However, the opportunity to think about all of this and feel the turmoil inside of myself was better than feeling cooped up and stuck in a rut. At least I was able to experience candid thinking. The boulders, the loneliness, being alone, being far away from civilization (minus the campsite just a mile away), gave me a feeling of peace and contemplation. I love backpacking, it opens up the can of worms we all so fearfully avoid opening up. We fear the darkness of our thoughts only to find out that our thoughts were not so abnormal and strange after all; that our ability to think and conceive ideas is what makes us creative, intelligent, and capable. Then, I packed up my belongings and hiked out of the wilderness, got in my car, and drove back to the city. It was short-lived but I think it was the act of doing it that helped me to enjoy the experience and not so much the experience itself (although the sunset was nice). It was my first sunset while laying on top of a boulder. I guess we are never ""too old"" for first time experiences - I was 29 when I backpacked solo.

I carried his day pack down back to camp and then he offloaded as much of his full pack contents into mine and I lashed things onto my pack. His shoulder came out again as he, out of reaction to prevent falling, went to brace himself to get over a boulder. 

Then I carried his full pack on my front and mine on my back for about another 10 minutes while his arm was out, till we ran into a group of hikers. Someone in the group observed him yelling in pain and turned out to be a doctor and assisted me in getting his arm back in again and then happened to have a sling so we could brace his shoulder from it coming out again.  Then another person in their party was only carrying water and volunteered to carry his pack down to the trailhead for him.

It was a rough trip for him and I swear I thought I was going to watch him die in front of me sliding down that snow field. A few people have died there on that same route over the years.

Prudent_Show_8643,t2_2omv8fzl,"He had crampons that were pretty stout while I had micro spikes but have more experience. He basically didn't admit his limitations and had hesitancy going up the snow fields and I told him that we could turn back or he could go down with another couple that wasn't planning on going past the snow fields. 

He basically admitted after the whole thing that he wasn't real with himself and was somewhat afraid of the heights and then when we started coming down I offered to go ahead and was going to re-carve out each footing since the snowpack had the sun shining on it and was starting to get a little slushy. He insisted he had it and was looking nervous though and moving faster than he should have been because he was anxious. He was about 6 ft away from me and he slipped coming off of a rock, because he didn't anticipate again due to the lack of experience the snow melting against the rock and his foot caved in some snow and off he went sliding. 

Once again based on My experience and doing this year after year with people with similar experience we always checked conditions and debated ice axe versus trekking poles. We chose to not bring our ice axes on this one since we weren't really getting into any real mountaineering and felt comfortable using the trekking poles. Everyone else was fine but like I said his anxiety and fear of heights got the best of him. 

We had gone over self-rescue but as he was panicking and falling I tried to coach him into sliding the right way, in a safe way and self-rescuing but he didn't grab his trekking pole low enough to the bottom of it and try to self-rescue without putting two hands on one trekking pole and using both arms and keeping his arms and elbows bent. His arms were fully extended and he only in a panic tried to self-rescue with one arm and immediately his shoulder just pulled out and he continued falling. I had no chance of getting to him as he accelerated very fast, probably ending up sliding at 30 miles an hour roughly down about 40 yards on a pretty steep angle. Yelled at him to keep looking at me and keep his head up and keep his legs bent and don't flip around and as he was falling thinking his life was about to end and I told him to brace for impact and kind of gave him a 3 -2-1 countdown So he wouldn't feel the urge to look below him to see when he was about to meet the rocks. 

The second he standed up I knew he and us we're going to be okay. He was screaming in pain but didn't hit his head and his legs were fine. I was anxious to get to him and hurry up but new two of us out of commission wouldn't do either of us any good so took my time getting down the snow field and got to him. He was saying his arm was broke and couldn't move it and I pulled up his sleeve and saw that his arm had dropped out of socket and had a big  indention where his shoulder should have been.

 I told him the good news is your arms not broke, The bad news is you're going to have to take this ibuprofen and bite on this stick and on the count of three I'm going to get your arm back in. 3 seconds layer and a couple screams and I got it in and he basically had no pain instantly right afterwards. To the point where I offered to make him a triangle arm sling out of my t-shirt and he insisted he felt good and was good to go. 

We got down the initial descent back to our base camp so to speak, and I helped him pack up so he wouldn't use his arm so much and we got going. We had to cross one more large boulder field with 10 to 15 ft boulders and boulder hopping. He went to brace himself for balance and his arm came right out again. He scrambled over the rocks and boulders for another 20 yards or so with one arm and got back to flat ground. Then we had to do it all over again but he was so tight on his muscles that a bystander that was there offered to hold him on the ground so he wouldn't try to pull forward as I was pulling his arm back in again. 

In hindsight, Anyone that goes with from here on I'm just going to tell to wear regular crampons, ice axes and helmets at all times. For myself I'll still probably modify My approach as well and use crampons just for some added traction as the microspikes weren't a for sure thing every step. I still probably won't take an ice ax within the same season around similar snow fields, but it all depends. 

We took ice axes going up paintbrush divide up the paintbrush canyon because researching ahead I knew that the snow fields there ended with a huge drop of and we're a little steeper and we actually brought rope too to tie into each other as well. 

This friend of mine had never been in mountain ranges like that and said that he's going to stick around to his east coast back woods and didn't come with me this past year on a trip when a group of us went out there to do some more backpacking and climbing.",1630338102,haxv6s3,t1_haxsr6k,/r/backpacking/comments/pei162/this_could_have_ended_much_worse_a_failed_summit/haxv6s3/,22,backpacking

keefography,t2_42qhjvm0,"Went out for a solo overnight backpacking trip on the Meyers Beach Lakeshore trail. It’s located on the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Cornucopia, WI. The 6 mile trail leads you to the only campsite located on the mainland in the Apostle Islands. A permit must be reserved in advance and costs $25 along with a $5 daily parking fee. Meyers Beach is predominantly known as a kayak destination with a plethora of sea caves and crevices to explore on Lake Superior, but it's just as beautiful from the trail!  
I filmed the hike and give a tour of the campsite in this video: https://youtu.be/QeKBzFH5zl8",1630152016,hao8gwa,t3_pd8ijw,/r/backpacking/comments/pd8ijw/backpacking_meyers_beach_lakeshore_trail_apostle/hao8gwa/,26,backpacking

Ninja_bambi,t2_5l12mlgc,"How much water you need varies from person to person, but even more important, depends on the circumstances. Have done trips where 2 liters a day was plenty (cold lower intensity) and trips where 8-10 liters a day was needed (hot and higher intensity). This is drinking alone, 'luxuries' like cooking, washing cooling etc is extra. When you've decided on how much you need it boils down to estimating the time required to get from one (reliable) resupply point to the next to decide on how much you need. You can reduce the amount you need to carry by making sure you depart from a resupply point well hydrated and cutting down on 'luxuries' between  resupplies. But be aware that cutting it too much can be dangerous. You may require more time than anticipated due to getting hurt, taking the wrong trail/trail finding, route being harder than expected, route being blocked or whatever or simply because the weather suddenly changes. So depending on the route a margin of safety may be required too.",1630056357,hajax23,t3_pcfasq,/r/backpacking/comments/pcfasq/how_much_water_should_i_be_bringing/hajax23/,2,backpacking

lakorai,t2_13rwloii,"Not a problem. You want to go with something with a 3"" or 4"" height so you can prevent your hips from digging into the ground. 

Semi inflating pads will definitely be more comfortable than air pads for the most part. The problem with semi inflators though is the pack size and weight are just way too big for backpacking. 

Most of the air pads on the market are 2"" or height or less. They are designed to cut weight as much as possible. 

If you wanted an air pad with the lowest weight, but still a good height and support then I would probably recommend the Exped Synmat HL LW. This cuts weight by tapering the pad to be narrower at the foot end and then having it nice and wide at the shoulders. 

If you wanted the same width at the shoulders and the feet then the SynMat UL LW or UL Winter series would be better.

I switched to non-gortex trail runners this year and I am never going back. After over 100 miles with them, including a couple 10+ mile days in the rain and some very hot and sweaty days, I did not get a single blister, not even a hot spot. I combine with Smartwool and Darn Tough merino wool socks and cruise in comfort now. 

Shoes are very personal, as everyone's feet/gait are different. I use Altra Lone Peaks, which may be a decent place to start for you. But from the sounds of it, you will never escape blisters in those boots. You need to keep trying new shoes until you find something that works for you.

data_monkey_69,t2_4rq4m9y3,"I was up in the winds last week and we did see a bear, but no issues. Cute little fella.  If your dog is well trained, then there shouldn't be any trouble, just use standard bear safety protocol. If your dog chases the bear and then the bear chases the dog and the dog comes running back to you, then you got yourself what we call a problem there cowboy. 

Consider leaving the dog at home? 

Too many freaking dogs off leash up there in the wind rivers. Maybe I'm a cranky old man, but getting tired of walking down the trail and having somebodies dog come running toward me with teeth bared and barking its head off and having some owner frantically screaming:

""Don't worry, he's friendly, he just want's to say hi.""

I don't care. I don't want to say hi to your doggo. Ruins my vibe. Leash the beast if it doesn't behave. 

Anyway, which way you going in? Big Sandy or coming in from the eastern side...Big Sandy is crowded AF, so get there early and preferably on a weekday if you want to get a nice spot at the lake.

Granite Canyon is not a slog as some might suggest. I thought it was actually very enjoyable. 

The climb out of the canyon is steep but survivable. However you’ll get to swim in a nice lake. I think it’s called Marion lake but I don’t have my maps on me. After the lake it’s dry all the way to Death Canyon Shelf, so you’ll have to carry your water for camp from the lake. 

Alaska Basin is very nice.

Where is your exit point? 

Walk in permits are not hard to get if you are willing to show up 2.5 hours before the ranger station opens.

DerTW13,t2_2ykfiunq,"Thanks for supplying that link, I read it and still don't understand why an already finished Teflon product would be a health risk if used correctly.

The problem this is referring to seems to be purely about the contamination of water surrounding Teflon production plants with PFOA. Which is a major f-up by DuPont (and other companies that have produced PTFE, apparently Parkersburg was not an isolated case). Don't get me wrong, people have every right to be mad about this and corporations releasing toxic waste into the environment are a huge problem. Sidenote: apparently, chemicals used in the production of Teflon have been changed to less harmful materials.

However, finished Teflon products are no health risk according to my knowledge and the quick internet search I conducted, unless overheated (where they release hydrofluoric acid and other toxic materials). Unfortunately, overheating is also what happens when this stuff is incinerated as waste.

My take on the situation is that the harm is already done: This Teflon product has already been produced and will have to be disposed of at some point. By using it, this harm is at least partly counterbalanced by maximum use of the product.

Oh, and by the way: Gore Tex membrane is the same material.",1629981006,haf00sg,t1_haesx7a,/r/backpacking/comments/pbqiz0/my_fiancées_uncle_just_gave_me_his_old_supplies/haf00sg/,9,backpacking

BourbonAndBlues,t2_4no3n,"I'll put it this way. DuPont wanted to check the levels of contamination in the blood of their employees. To do that, they needed to find a control blood sample without any PFAS contamination. They couldn't. They had to go to blood draws for recruits for the Korean War, before PFAS was widely used, to find it. This stuff is everywhere. It leeches out of finished product, and if you overheat a Teflon pan you get to breath it in! It's in almost all fabric treatments/Scotchgard and waterproofing treatments too, which is real rough for backpacking.

The stuff is evil. The courts even ruled against them, so they went and changed chemicals... To something crazy similar that is likely just as bad or worse.

Janvonfalken,t2_xtr5zi5,"Ah, I see, you've got the 250 version then. I'd probably go for the full version because I also have the 2C topquilt, I think I could push that system to a March-November setup that way. I'm currently using a MYOG snugpak blanket 3/4 underquilt, the 3/4 really isn't a big problem for summer camping, I wonder if that'd change in winter. The 2C topquilt is almost a little to warm for the summer, I might try my hand at MYOG-ing a summer quilt eventually, that should be a fairly easy project. 

I dont have their down booties, but I'd be interested in giving them a try. I wonder if they'd do much though, the quilt has a pretty thick footbox, most of the heat getting lost goes out of the parts where the down is compressed, the down socks would probably have the same effect.

vagrantreality,t2_awk4j81t,"I have exactly this one, got it on clearance for about the same price. I took a chance cause I was buying during the pandemic and couldn’t go in for a fitting, so I took my measurements and chose it based off its adjustability and the price (other choice was an osprey that was half and again as much on sale). 

Fit: turns out I measure good. I’m 5’ 6”, 230 lbs; 38” hips, 42” waist, and relatively broad shoulders/chest but I can’t remember the exact measurement. After spending some time adjusting everything, it rides really nicely, with the hip belt providing great support, making even a heavy pack feel much lighter. I’m no ultralight hiker, so that’s definitely a plus. 

I initially didn’t care for the organization layout but after some time with it I’m overall pretty happy. I don’t really use the bottom access panel, because my sleep system is strapped to the underside of the pack. My only gripe anymore is that the mesh side pockets aren’t accessible with the pack on, so they’re not great for holding a water bottle if that’s your primary drinking vessel. However, I went ahead and bought their 3L water bladder that fits inside and I couldn’t be happier with it. Easiest fill I’ve ever had with one, and the quick release so you can leave the tube in place is fantastic.

BigArmsBigGut,t2_7lbd4,"~2 years ago I got in my kayak in the spring for the first time that year and got bit by a spider who had made it into his winter home.  It swelled up massively and was really painful and itchy, and Benadryl fixed that.  I was 29 when that happened, and before that I'd never had a reaction to a bug bite like that.  It was no where near life threatening, but man it would have sucked to hike on that leg.

I'll probably never forget the trip that I decided Benadryl was necessary.  I was 3 days into a 4-day rafting trip down a remote river in eastern Oregon.  A lady I was with was stung by a bee, and she broke out in hives and was struggling to breathe.  Fortunately we had Benadryl, but it was a race to finish that trip and get her to a hospital.  I didn't know her very well, a friend of a friend type of thing, but I gather that she was not aware she was allergic to bees before that and didn't have an EpiPen.  

A couple of Benadryl costs you what, 2 grams?  It seems well worth it to me.",1629902994,haarkc2,t1_ha929zf,/r/backpacking/comments/pamdt5/alright_lets_see_how_an_ultra_lighter_does_on/haarkc2/,1,backpacking

You don’t need a fork, knife, and spoon for Mountain House Meals and oatmeal - just bring the spoon, or even better, a long spoon. That saw trowel could probably be replaced with something lighter and more compact. A Swiss Army knife would probably be just as useful as that multi-tool while taking up less space. For food it looks like you have a lot of healthy snacks but it’s probably a good idea to pack some junk food too. I like fruit snacks or gummy worms for a little bit of a sugar boost.

Cute-Quail6771,t2_78pwc0xr,"Last year we were supposed to travel through South America for 3 months. That - of course - could not happen due to the pandemic. Instead we managed to book a trip to Italy, which has been one of the best I have ever been on. We started in Milan, and after a few stops we arrived in the Dolomites. This specific hike is near Cortina d'Ampezzo. It is possible, though not really legal, to camp there, so instead we stayed in one of the rifugios. I would not really advice you to do so though, as the price/quality ratio was not that good. However, the hike was the best of the whole trip. It rained a lot unfortunately, but we still had a good time. I would definitely go back again (hopefully with better weather) and would 100% recommend you to go here. Keep in mind that you have to pay an entrance fee when entering the park (at least with your car) in cash and there are no ATMs there.",1629795006,ha51v2x,t3_pajdlr,/r/backpacking/comments/pajdlr/last_year_we_backpacked_through_the_northern_part/ha51v2x/,1,backpacking

kilsekddd,t2_4bitw,"Often they are in the first aid kit, but emergency blankets.   I usually keep 3 in my pack at all times.  Can be used for warmth, a lean-to, water collector, etc.  Pound for pound (weighs a few ounces), one of the most versatile and compact materials you can have.

Source:   Pulled out one when I had to nap on a bench in the national forest in 30 deg weather.   Used the same one when it rained later w/ some cord.

Also love a good meter of duct tape wrapped around a pencil.  In addition to the normal crap you can think of, it's the best blister management material.  Moleskin fails hard with moisture and ends up making things worse once a blister has formed.  Use:  pop blister w/ needle, cleanse w/ alcohol, duct tape generously over the area.  It's like armor for your weakest spot.

Source:  Had 3"" blisters on both heals 15hrs into 72 hour expedition race.  Duct taped both heals and completed the race with zero discomfort or recurrence.  Same race, also patched a snag in my ultra light rain jacket sleeve after tearing it on a branch while bushwhacking (the tape is still there 10 years later).",1629806370,ha5goxw,t3_paecsm,/r/backpacking/comments/paecsm/rate_my_loadout_3_days_in_northern_cascades/ha5goxw/,6,backpacking

I used to bring paracord. You'll never use it. Get some UHMWPE string instead for bear hangs.

There are no philips or flat head screws in the backcountry. There are no cans to open. Trade the heavy multitool for a folding knife.

I'd definitely take a rain jacket even if there's no rain forecasted. Mountains can be strange + they act as windbreaker in camp + another insulating layer.

Trail notes:

First 5 km from Cline trailhead to Coral Creek has mo water.  

Coral Creek goes into a gorge. Top can be explored with extreme caution. Good overlook from spur just before the creek. 

Upstream the Job Pass trail crosses the creek dozens of times. Just get you feet wet. 

East side of Job is a gradual slope. West side is very steep and unfun when wet

The trail up Afternoon pass from the Brazeau side is not obvious. 

The trail up ti Cataract Creek is obvious from the bottom but is hard yo follie about half way up due to a mid slide. 

On te Cline side Cataract Creek has a lot of deadfall across the trail. 

Top of McDonald Creek (afternoon pass) has a side trip to a valley of lakes. No trails. 

Afternoon pass itself has a nice ridge walk adjoining it. Ive never taken it beyond the first knob. 

The McDonald Creek trail is vague in spots.

If you are set on being off the ground and find hammocks comfortable, you're pretty much fine. You'll need an air pad or an under quilt to not freeze (climate depending). When you lay on your down sleeping bag, it compresses and you lose all insulation. 

However, if your goal is to go super light... here's the thing. You already have to bring a tarp to put over your hammock, and you already need an air pad. So why bring a hammock at all? Build an A-frame tent with two trekking poles, the tarp, and some Paracord and you can ditch the hammock all together without bringing anything extra.

SOL-Cantus,t2_lz6zo,"You can use freeze-dried prefab meals if you have the water, it just takes longer to rehydrate. Just bring a water filter and some Aquamira and you're a-okay (though I wouldn't try to filter ocean water b/c that's going to screw up your filter). Key point, noodles or potato flake ones rehydrate well cold, but things that have beans, rice, or shredded potato take a long time (think an hour).

Dried mango tends to be some of the best for dried fruit (my wife swears by it), but almost any dried fruit (with the exception of berries) will work. Going with the above cold-rehydrated system, pair the dried fruit and some nuts to instant oatmeal packets (watch out for sugar bombs) and it's a great breakfast.

If you do prep ahead of time and/or eat within 2 days, pre-packaged cheeses (mozzarella sticks and baby bell) work perfectly fine as long as it's transported to the trailhead at refrigeration temp. [Confit](https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-what-the-heck-is-confit) bacon or sausage and store it in a solid fat (careful on using all the bacon fat as it's insanely salty) in a sealable container (silicone, reusable lunch bags are now a great option) and you've got a solid additional chunk of protein and fat. Confit works for pretty much anything, although I wouldn't use it past the 2 day mark without cooking or further storage/processing. If you're going veg, pea protein, chickpea protein, soybean, etc. can also be blended into other foods for a [""complete""](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/incomplete-protein#vegetarian-and-vegan-diet) protein source, although it's a bit less simple to confit this way (fewer solid fats readily available). Do note, confit is not healthy in the long run, so use this as a way to survive backpacking, not as a metric for daily cooking.

For snacks, gummies are a good calorie add-on, but you lose out on the protein/nutrients. Peanut butter/almond butter packets are phenomenal for protein. Jerky, trail mix, and granola are all classics, but tend to be either far too high in sugar/sodium or are otherwise very thirst inducing for less caloric gain. If you're a fish fan, tuna is absolutely viable (I can't stand the stuff, but I'm an outlier).

In terms of bars, I've tried almost everything from classic Nature Valley/Clif to Probars and Rxbars. It's often very palate dependent, but here's the run-down from my end:

* To start, I never use workout bars (Powerbars are a good example) because they do very weird things to my GI tract even when it's not filled with pointless ""brutal workout bod extras."" Caffeine should come from things like tea, coffee, and snacks that aren't your dinner.
* Nature Valley is the OG bar, but tends to be too low on fat and protein to be functional. If you're on a budget, it's great paired with peanut butter for a breakfast meal, but I'd supplement with some other B-Vitamin rich protein.
* Clif is the next step up, but still fails on the protein count. Larabar is about equal here too, but with better flavor.
* Kate's and Kind are both higher in protein to the point you could *maybe* use them as part of main meals.
   * Kind is pretty standard these days, but generally doesn't have enough calories that are easily absorbable (nuts and other harder to digest foods tend to pass through your system before being fully absorbed).
   * Kate's is...okay, this is where significant bias comes in. The texture is kind of like a cardboard rice krispy for me, and the ones I ate (cherry and lemon) were far too sweet. For a ""real food"" bar, this was a big miss, and my wife definitely agrees there. If you have the budget to try, I would test one of the more standard ones, but avoid the fruit variations.
* Probar and Rxbar are now my go-to bars. Not super thirst inducing (like all of the previous), high enough in calories, and with a nutritionally adequate quantity/type of fat, carbs, and protein that can count. That said, Rxbar is on the sweeter side and definitely a sticky creature. Probar is less flavorful, but 100% a meal unto itself.

Key take-aways on bars/meals...avoid sugar bombs and things with too many artificial additions, but don't believe the hype on ""organic, non-gmo...blah, blah, blah,"" being better either. Organic doesn't automatically mean healthy, it just means it's grown to certain specifications associated with pesticides and farming techniques. A non-GMO product also doesn't mean healthy. Healthy means it's nutritionally balanced and appropriate for the activities you're participating in.",1629707029,ha0d7xe,t3_p6jeb1,/r/backpacking/comments/p6jeb1/dry_foods_no_stove_recs/ha0d7xe/,2,backpacking

SOL-Cantus,t2_lz6zo,"On gauze...a lot of folks are going to use gauze incorrectly. It's not designed for exposure to rough terrain, inclement weather, etc., whereas a sanitary pad actually can function (albeit still in a limited capacity) when exposed to water, friction, and other issues. That's not to say ""don't use gauze."" In fact, it can be very important for some injuries (e.g. reducing moisture around the wound by allowing it to breath), but then we get into ""how do I keep the wound clean while trekking,"" and ""how much gauze/tape do I bring?"" I'm not formally trained in first aid/wilderness first aid, and I'm not going to describe specifics that I don't have the training for. Should it be in a ""bare minimum"" kit? Necessarily no, but it's a decent add-on if you want and I wouldn't recommend against it either.

On that topic...tourniquets...this is probably the most recommended and least advisable ""simple solution"" to bleeding for first aid regardless of activity or location. Simply put, unless you're trained in first aid/response (and I do mean active training with a professional, not just an online course), you DO NOT want to screw up tourniquet use. Too tight or misapplied and you can cause nerve damage, lose a limb, or worse. In a true emergency (we're talking femoral artery level wound), yes a tourniquet (any tourniquet) is a good idea, but the average person isn't going to be facing that.

So, for the average backpacker (established trails, short duration hikes, etc), I would not advise keeping a specialized tourniquet on-hand unless they have the aforementioned training. That said, we should all really get that training on principle. Once the pandemic is over I plan on it, and possibly even further (Wilderness First Responder) if I start bringing more inexperienced friends along.",1629708315,ha0en83,t1_h9zsz53,/r/backpacking/comments/p9lnyn/what_am_i_missing_what_can_i_drop/ha0en83/,5,backpacking

Pet insurance is a thing but we don't have it. It's not always beneficial with monthly cost vs actual coverage and vets that accept. One place I worked offered it but the only vets that accepted at the time were in CO. We lived in GA. I know the vet we have now does not accept pet insurance. The best they can do is Care Credit.

This was our itinerary:

Day 1: Agnew Meadows to Thousand Island Lake  
Day 2: Day hike to North Glacier Pass, Lake Catherine, and Banner Peak  
Day 3: Day hike to Marie Lakes  
Day 4: Thousand Island Lake to Ediza Lake  
Day 5: Ediza Lake to Minaret Lake via Iceberg and Cecile Lakes  
Day 6: Minaret Lake to Devil’s Postpile

The mileage on this trip was moderate. We liked camping at Thousand Island Lake for three nights - not only was it a beautiful spot, it allowed us to do two day hikes. Our favorite day was hiking from Ediza to Minaret - Cecile in particular was a gem. Thousand Island Lake was busy - especially our first night which was a Saturday. JMT was busy (what we expected), but side trips off it weren't so busy (for example we saw no people when we went to Marie Lakes).

Scalare,t2_k2la8,"The brands I'm aware of are Garmin Inreach, Spot and Zoleo. They all do the same job; but some will have different features. Something to keep in mind is the cost of the subscription; which aren't cheap. 

I believe the cheapest is probably a Spot Gen4; which is pretty basic in terms of function (it does SOS, check in's and tracking). Spot has their other model (the Spot X); which has some extra functionality.

Spot has another model (the Spot X); which is probably the best option as a stand-alone model. It does two way messaging, has a keyboard, and can do super basic waypoint navigation in addition to the features of a Gen4. The updated version of the X has bluetooth to pair with a phone; but you can get full usage out of it without the phone. Downside is that it's bigger and clunkier than it's competition; and they keyboard is pretty 'meh'.

Garmin has their Inreach models. The inreach mini tends to be the most popular; but more expensive models incorporate more sophisticated GPS navigation options. To really get full functionality out of them you need to pair them with a phone (although they can be used without, although if you're messaging somewhat painfully as they lack a keyboard). 

The Zoleo sits between the Spot Gen4 and the Inreach Mini. It does two way messaging when paired with a phone like the inreach; but it's on device functionality is closer to a Gen4. It also sits in the middle in terms of pricing.

Service plans get complicated depending on exactly what you plan to use; but Spot is going to be cheaper. The trade off is that Spot uses a different network that is considered less reliable. That being said, I have a Spot X and it generally does what I expect it to do.",1629352711,h9i2onl,t3_p76rm4,/r/backpacking/comments/p76rm4/satellite_sos_gps/h9i2onl/,1,backpacking

It has a ""low current"" mode that keeps.the power bank from automatically shutting off when charging something that doesn't draw a lot of current, like a watch.

Employment, military logistic corps, personal living goals, the pursuit of off grid homesteading with a focus on primitive living. That is, the pursuit of a sense of personal accomplishment derived from constantly engaging in tasks that modern living eliminates. Like a sense of gratification from chopping wood, carrying water, growing plants, hunting, trapping, living in simple conditions rather than in unnecessarily large and under utilized spaces that we pretend to obtain value from and will dedicate decades of our temporary existence to obtain in jobs we rarely get satisfaction from. Ever hear the song 'Civilization' by I think the beejees, it's an old song, it plays in a video game, fallout. It encompasses the essence of what I mean, in a condensed, comedic way. We have evolved to eliminate so much from our daily lives that we have almost eliminated the sense of value and accomplishment which typically came with them. We have been in a state of perpetual luxury for a very short time and have already forgotten that the things that make us happy, consistently, have been the things we've been doing for the past 2 billion years.

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to go on eastern european roadtrip by car starting from Bruxelles.

Should I bring my camera G85 from panasonic with only 2 lenses Kit and tele ?

&amp;#x200B;

**Already in my backpack**  *(+ one suit case for clothes, meal replacement food and miscellaneous):*

\- Macbook pro 16 + height holder nextstand + usb C to usb 3.0 converter

\- Ipad 9,7 2018 + basic aluminium holder

\- cables + multi usb charger

\- keyboard K480 from logitech

\- Iphone 12 Pro max

\- mini rechargeable cube light

\- Deity mic and 2 lavalier mics.

\- Tripod for smartphone or dslr (cheap gorillapod)

&amp;#x200B;

**Optional** :

\- Stabilizator for iphone and done

\- Cheap xiaomi selfie stick/tripod with bluitooth command  


&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2 :**

\- Bring G85 panasonic

\- Kit lense 12-60

\- tele lense 30 to 120mm.

\-  3 batteries + charger

\- peak design holder on the belt *(not sure of the term belt, excuse me I am french)* of the backpack because the camera won’t fit my backpack.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to shoot vidéo for my youtube channel as a financial educator during my roadtrip, so I don’t really need 4K high quality. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Good sound is mandatory tho.**

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if G85 will be a true savior or smartphone is sufficient nowadays.

Every weight counts.

To many, Mansour Al-Hallaj is a revelation. Known as a mystic who had annihilated the concept of self to become one with God, Mansour Al-Hallaj was executed for just that. Those who had come to hear the teachings of Mansour Al-Hallaj were polarized, and those that were in power in Baghdad declared Mansour Al-Hallaj to be a heretic after he proclaimed that he is the ""truth"".   
Mansour Al-Hallaj's claims were interpreted to be a declaration of divination and therefore blaspheny. And so, in 922, Mansour Al-Hallaj was hanged on the banks of the Tigris River.   
Today, many believe that Mansour Al-Hallaj's remains rest in the very site which I visited.

It felt painful at first and immediately bruised up. When I got back home it looked like [this](https://i.imgur.com/vmCLjYW.png). 

I can walk on it with a bit of pain, but I took a week off work and have a 3 day backpacking trip coming up tomorrow. You reckon I can do the 40kms over 3 days with the bruised foot or should I just avoid it? I've never had bruising this bad on my feet before and I'm not sure if hiking will make the swelling worse.

Right now I'm taking 2 advils every 6 hours and applying voltaren every 12 hours.

We parked our car, strapped on our 30lb. packs, and went on what was soon to be the adventure(the beginning of MANY more to come) of my lifetime. I've seen the Eiffel Tower, London Eye, etc., but Yosemite's views of jagged mountains and rolling hills, covered in California's wonderful pine trees makes it such a gift that I live in such a beautiful state. Anyways, we left on our journey at around 8am and arrived to Sunset Lakes at around 11:30am, absorbing all the views and sites around us. We set up camp, and the next morning we were off to conquer Cloud's Rest. This was my first real backpacking trip, aside from car camping and short overnighters with the Boy Scouts, and it was amazing.

Expensive_Meaning682,t2_a0eree8o,"This would not be a good idea and decreasing your food intake while hiking will likely lead to fatigue, loss of muscle, and low blood sugar. It will increase your risk of injury while hiking to be in a deficit. If you preload beforehand, your body just stores it as fat and it’s not a balanced source of fuel for your body when you start to metabolize it. I would recommend looking for calorically dense foods to add to your meals to boost the calories with minimal weight. Not sure of your dietary restrictions but foods like nut butters, nuts, oil are very dense in calories and can help supplement meals. Also, you may have explored this already but freeze dried foods are light weight and can help decrease your pack weight.",1628947685,h8wpkds,t3_p46xy5,/r/backpacking/comments/p46xy5/can_i_preeat_my_calories/h8wpkds/,4,backpacking

AniMeu,t2_hyyur,"No hate but why does the video focus way too hard on the dude in the middle (I assume it is you?).

The way the drone keeps in the middle for every slight movement ( both paning left and right as you walk) means that you are the focus of that shot. And as you do absolutely nothing in particular (except for you looking back), this shot is a bit wasted. Even worse, the slight movements to the left makes the viewer expect to see more of the sea, but it goes back to you doing nothing.

As a viewer, and as you promote even in the title the landscape, I definitively would have liked to see more of the sea or to check out the beach itself. Or have one swift movement forward, going up whatever. 

But this shot is a self-documentation (which is fine in itself! Don't get me wrong, I think it is fine if you want to document *your* trip), but even for that it really misses an action (getting onto the boat, swim into the sea or just start juggling, idk). 

So I think this clip would be utterly meaningless without your title, as it is not clear at all what you want to show.
