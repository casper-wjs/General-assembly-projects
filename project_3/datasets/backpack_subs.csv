We literally hiked out after two nights in the backcountry and then we drove straight to the airport and dropped off the rental car. We had to repack our gear by the ticket counter and put certain things in our checked luggage (tent poles, stakes, knife, etc). Unfortunately, in our scramble, we failed to check our cookware that can house the burner and fuel canister. Obviously, that’s a no no, which we knew considering we bought the fuel canister in NM, and had intended to trash the fuel canister before going through security. Well, we forgot, and TSA was not forgiving of the mistake. We were even able to tell them exactly where it was in the bag and apologized for the error, trying to explain the circumstance. Instead they took pictures of IDs and boarding pass. We were told to await a letter in the mail deciding if we just get a warning or we get a fine and loss of any future TSA Pre-check privileges (which would really suck considering we paid for Global Entry right before the pandemic hit and have only gotten to use it once). So moral of the story, don’t be like us; double check your gear, ask your travel buddy if they took care of it, and make a to do list you reference while repacking.

This question came up because I have seen how low the prices for those lotion bottles in reality are, even if you don't buy them in mass.

It has an older but well regarded fixed back length suspension (Cyclops, I think), but is available in four sizes.

But even with that, the back length feels kind of short. With the waist belt centered on my iliac crest and cinched, shoulders pulled down snug, and even with no real weight in the pack, the load lifters barely have any angle. AFAIK, I don't have an unusually long torso, though I haven't measured it, but I can't imagine someone 6'4"" using this pack, at least not with effective lifters, which are kind of a big deal with a pack this size (it's really a 90L+20L+, and rated for weights well over 50kg). Am I just missing something about the fit/setup of a pack or ruck of this type? I'm almost considering some sort of ""lifter lifters"" to try and get more angle.

Thank you for taking the time to read. I turn to this sub because I don’t have any backpacker friends that I know of and seek guidance. I hope this can help out other relatively inexperienced individuals who also struggle with posture find answers in a convenient manner! (I look to even share these good answers on physiology and movement forums and pages i subscribe to) So, I have always struggled with posture. Despite exercising and stretching frequently, due to an athletic injury I have formed years of bad habits that I thought were the right way to think about posture. 

With that being said, besides placement on the back, tightness of straps, an even  distribution of weight, chest strap, etc.  I struggle to find real life, physiologically sound, experienced answers to questions like: 

-Should the adjustment straps always be even lengths even though the arm straps feel level and even? 

-Should I still have my shoulder blades “primed” flat or backwards even though it kind of fights the geometry of my backpack?

-I’ve seen so many people have a shoulder-over-hip gait while carrying heavy rucksacks and likewise. Is this to carry more load to the legs and should this logic be slightly implemented for regular backpack/booksack use? (More hip bend ig)

-Is grabbing the arm straps to pull the load forward a bad habit compared to swinging arms in a natural gait? 

- Should the chest strap be placed higher up, about at armpit level? Should it be mid-pec level, the largest part of my chest in diameter (like nipple level i guess?), or even just below the pec? I have seen instructional material show this strap at all of these placements. As a strap that helps transfer a load, it seems impractical to suggest it’s a preference thing

-When I adjust my straps to what I understand to be proper tightness, I struggle getting the backpack off and definitely have to loosen it before putting back on. Does this mean they’re too tight? 

-Should I tighten the chest strap as tight as possible (without restricting movement or breathing obviously)

-Main question, really just concerning hip placement and flexion while carrying a backpack and commuting. I’ve heard people argue that the spine dissipates a load through its slight curve therefore hips should remain “primed” or tilted forward?
I have also heard arguments for the hips being primed or tilted forward in order for a more straight back, implying the core should be bearing more load. I am aware this is ideal for general sitting and standing posture. However this creates almost a “lean back” position and can especially feel that way when carrying a backpack. 

Once again, I appreciate all guidance and advice this may get. Anything will certainly help me out! 
Hope it isn’t too much. Just some questions I have had while commuting  with a back pack for years that I have yet to find true answers to. I feel some of these questions seem “nit-picky”, just seems unlikely that all of these things are preference, theres got a be a proper way of doing them.

It was affecting the ground beneath our feet, making it tremble. Solid ground shouldn’t do that. This was uncharted territory.

“Señor, is that thunder? Is it about to rain?” I asked Eduardo, our guide. He’d dragged his rotund figure up and down this mountain over three hundred times before even turning twenty-five. 

“Que? Thunder?” he replied with confusion. His English didn’t extend much further than pure repetition. We received no further elaboration. It wasn’t quite the answer I was hoping for.

The hike continued. We’d been walking for more than four hours and were passing through the cloud cover now. Our base camp, where we would spend the night ahead of tomorrow morning’s ascent to the summit of Acatenango, couldn’t be much further. 

Despite the altitude, the scenery remained green, lush and fertile. Plants and birds were everywhere. Our surroundings brightened and darkened as the clouds engulfed and then passed us by. The trees here were strange. In most cases, they were stripped of their branches and leaves. They stood alone as trunks, punctuating the lower level vegetation.

As we rose above the clouds, our surroundings changed. The vegetation thinned and the ground became darker. In many places, it was now covered in black ash. Large boulders were scattered around in strange locations as if placed there purposefully by giants. Eventually, the trembling sounds passed us by. We wondered whether we actually heard any thunder in the first place, as the weather didn’t seem to suggest a storm was nearby. Maybe the exertion of the hike was causing auditory hallucinations. Maybe it was something a little more dramatic.

“Pausa, pausa,” Eduardo turned to us and said, breathless. It was slightly worrying that the altitude was starting to get to him as we approached 4000m above sea level. He was supposed to be supporting us, not the other way around.

“No worries dude, we must be close now though?” A member of our hiking group asked him.

“Si, si, muy cerca... Very close... We will get there soon... Necesito pausa,” he took a few more deep breaths then led us on.

We followed the trail for another four-hundred metres, climbing steadily as we progressed. The ground was getting steeper now, rising up sharply to our left. A colossal drop fell away to our right. Small towns were barely visible far down below us. We rounded the caldera for a final time, and in the distance, we could see a row of large scout tents, three of them in total. Home for the night. 

As we approached the tents, something even more impressive came into view. The perfectly conical Volcan de Fuego. One of the most active volcanoes on planet earth. It stood just a kilometre across from where we stood near the top of its twin, Acatenango. Fuego looked like the prototypical volcano which you’d see in a geography textbook, forming a sharp, pointed punctuation of the landscape surrounding it. From our vantage point, it stood alone in a wide plateau. A flat tabletop hidden away in the Guatemalan highlands. In the distance below, you could see the twinkle of streetlights from the small pueblos in the countryside surrounding the colonial city of Antigua.

A campfire was lit, and we settled down for a cup of red wine, admiring this most epic geological backdrop. 

And then it happened. A cloud of ash and rock blasted out of the tip of the volcano’s cone. Moments later a torrent of molten rock was flowing down the mountainside. A second after that, the sound hit us. A huge crashing and rumbling washed over, again making the ground tremble. That noise we’d heard earlier wasn’t thunder. It continued to reverberate as boulders the size of cars were thrown hundreds of metres down the mountainside. 

I was standing next to Ben, a doctor from New Zealand, who was in Guatemala as part of his training, working in a hospital abroad for two months. His immediate reaction really summed up the mood of most of the group.

“HOLY FUCKING SHIT! IT'S IRUPTING!” he shouted in his thick Kiwi accent.

He wasn’t the only member of our group who was moved by the event. A girl, Neta, from Amsterdam, on the hike with her boyfriend Max, burst into tears. The sheer power of nature moved her to such an emotional extent that she was literally crying. This was really something that we were witnessing here.

So I thought I'd treat myself to a short week of backpacking through some part of the country. I'll be joining my friend on a train ride to the far north via Stockholm, but due to the weather I don't think it's wise to go hiking and camping any further north than Stockholm. I've been scouring the internet for the past two nights to find trails, and I've found some very cool things. It seems the trail system is a little more decentralized and DIY than I'm used to though, so finding interesting parts and sections isn't so easy.

The trails that seem very interesting to me:
- Skåneleden coast to coast. Doesn't look like the wildest trail to me, but I might be able to figure a 5-day section that passes through mostly wild lands. It's just so big that I barely know where to start.
- Bergslagleden, but only south of Örebro. Seems like a less well-known trail but looks to pass through some beautiful nature. Only getting there and back seems very difficult, and it's also very inland so possibly quite cold at night.
- Bohusleden, between Gothenburg and Uddevalla. Seems like a nicely defined stretch that fits in my time. Does it have wilderness though?

I'm looking to hike between 4-7 days. I'm relatively fit and can walk 15-25km a day depending on the steepness and altitude. Southern Sweden seems to be okayish flat, so I'll be erring on the side of &gt;20km. I'm generally well-prepared, just not for freezing temperatures (actually I'd rather avoid less than 5 degrees C). I'll be camping. I'd prefer to be away from it all for a while, so some wilderness is really nice. A town along the way would be nice too for recharging batteries and stuff, and I also don't mind walking past nice historic places. Coast and forest are both as beautiful to me as the other so I really don't care. I know October isn't the best month for backpacking in Sweden but my schedule just happens to line up like this.

August 13th-August 16th

3 nights, 4 days

Weather: Extremely hot and sunny, fairly humid (but I’m coming from the East Coast where it’s not uncommon to have humidity in the 90% range). 

Resources: We brought the National Geographic Mount Hood Wilderness topographic map and a print out of the Oregonhikers.com Timberline Trail field guide. We also used the book “Around &amp; About Mount Hood” by Sonia Buist for trip planning purposes but didn’t bring it because of the extra weight. 

Most Valuable Possession (MVP): I would probably say my hiking poles for the river crossings and sand. Sunscreen and a hat were also critical. I lathered up so much I barely even came away with a tan. 

Least Valuable Possession (LVP): My raincoat and rain pants never even left the bottom of my bag.

I don’t use fancy gear or any apps so my mileage for each day are merely estimates based on my map, the reroute on the PCT, and resources I found online. They are not exact.

Day 1: 

My dad and I started fairly late in the day because of the heat advisory. We both received numerous emergency alerts on our phones to remain inside and not participate in strenuous exercise due to the unusually hot temperatures. On our first day the high was 103 degrees in Portland and in the mid 90’s at Timberline Lodge in the afternoon (with the real feel being over 100 degrees once you add in the humidity). 

We did the trail clockwise after seeing another Reddit post about the west side having more shade. Given the incredibly hot weather, it was a no brainer. At every stream we took the opportunity to soak our hats in the refreshing water in an attempt to keep us cool. We took the Paradise Park detour which was well worth it, with gorgeous views of Mount Hood and meadows full of wildflowers. 

Along with being hot, it was also very smoky due to nearby wildfires. Because of these two things, we cut our first day short, around 5.3 miles rather than the 9 we originally planned for. We found a campsite with a picture perfect view of the mountain which I enjoyed from my hammock.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2: 

We did 13.5 miles on day 2 to make up for our short first day. This was a challenging day for multiple factors. For a stretch of at least 5 miles, there were biting flies. Although the hiking was frequently uphill (blessedly shaded for many portions), I couldn’t stop for more than a minute or two at a time before being bitten on any exposed part of my body, including my face. Funnily, they didn’t bother my dad at all, only me - lucky him!

We also hit the section of the trail that was closed due to a severe storm in August 2020, causing trees to be flattened and making the trail impassable. While we took the reroute on the PCT before joining back up with the Timberline Trail, we still encountered fallen trees across the trail, slowing us down considerably as we either had to go up and over or under them. The trail also became difficult to follow at times due to the wreckage and we often had to spend time scouting out the correct route.

We had our first significant water crossing, Sandy River. Looking back, it was a breeze, but since it was my first legit river crossing I still took my time getting across. There were rocks and then a thin log to cross on. 

We went through a section of burnt out forest from the 2011 Dollar Lake fire, which was uniquely beautiful with its white, ashy tree trunks contrasted against the green of the evergreens.The wind changed directions and the smoke and haze cleared considerably, leading to some breathtaking vistas. We had views of Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams in the distance. We also met numerous people who were trail running the whole thing in a day. Although I’m incredibly impressed with their endurance, that sounds miserable to me!

We took the Eden Park detour at the recommendation of our guidebook (she specifically describes it as “one of the jewels of the Timberline Trail”), but personally, I wouldn’t suggest it. According to the Nat Geo map, it adds an extra 1.4 miles and, while pretty, I didn’t find it nearly as striking as Paradise Park, Elk Cove, or the meadows from day 4 (before the White River canyon). We unexpectedly found a fantastic campsite at the point we started to get exhausted near the intersection of the Eden Park and Vista Ridge trails, with a consistent breeze and views of both Mount Hood and the faint Portland city lights in the distance.

Day 3: 

Our third day was around 13 miles and my favorite of the trip due to the variety of experiences and landscapes.

Elk Cove, a meadow with streams, wildflowers, and a killer view of Mount Hood, completely lived up to my expectations. The purple monkey-flower and lupine lining the streams were so perfect, they looked fake. I only wish I had been able to spend more time there. 

We had the two most significant river crossings of the trip - Coe and Eliot. 

To cross Coe, we changed into sandals and used our hiking poles. Coe was the coldest water I’ve ever felt in my life. When I got to the other side, I fell over since my legs had gone numb. 

Eliot was very dangerous and anxiety producing. We could hear the rush of the water long before we could see it. Getting down to the river was challenging in and of itself. Thankfully no one was around because we were accidentally sending rocks rolling down the hill in our attempt to descend. The only reason we were able to safely get across Eliot was that there was paracord strung up which we used to hold on to for dear life as we sidestepped across. I wasn’t prepared for how strong the current was going to be. The water came up to my belly button (I’m 5’9”). My dad, who is an avid backpacking and has a great deal more experience than I do, said it was the worst crossing he’s ever done. I felt a huge sense of accomplishment after we got to the other side!

After eating lunch at Cloud Gap, we hiked what felt like the longest mile of my life - a super steep, completely exposed section in sand going uphill. I was also carrying a few extra liters of water since there were no water sources for a while, weighing me down even more. It was brutal.

Our reward was snow! We had to cross it on the trail at one point and then went sledding on my raincoat down another patch. That was the first time I can say I went sledding in August. Gnarl Ridge offered beautiful, rugged views. We camped right before Newton Creek in a semi-circle of boulders.

Day 4:

We woke up early enough on our last day to see the sunrise and got surprised by a pika! If you don’t know what a pika is, Google it - they’re adorable.

Our last 7.3 miles were incredibly diverse, with a mix of forest, lush meadows, numerous streams and waterfalls, and exposed sand and rock. We started to see signs of civilization the closer we got to the Timberline lodge, like crossing a dirt road (the only one of the hike) and hiking under ski lifts. We were able to rock hop over both branches of White River, no issues there. 

The last two miles or so was uphill in the sand. For every step forward, we slipped a bit back. It was the perfect challenge to close out our hike.

**Hiking rating:** 10/10, would recommend to anyone who has some backpacking experience (particularly river crossing experience). It’s doable in 2 nights, 3 days, but I much prefer time to take breaks, enjoy camp at the end of the day, and soak up all the nature I can get (before returning to my depressing office job).",backpacking,"Trip Report: Timberline Trail, Mount Hood, Oregon",https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/pogc1t/trip_report_timberline_trail_mount_hood_oregon/

2) **Trail is a circuit** — We just don't want to NEED a shuttle to get to or from anywhere. 

3) **Weekend trip** — We'll save the PCT for later. 

4) **&lt;1 day's drive from Chicagoland** — 'nuff said!

I've done a significant amount of searching online for the right GPS for me, yet I can't seem to find the type of product I'm looking for.

Most of the GPS systems I've seen are super complex - tons of data, map overlays, etc. It's a little visually overwhelming for me. And I'm not interested in having so much functionality, anyways.

I'm basically looking for 2 things from a GPS:

1) breadcrumbs feature - if all else fails, I'd like to be able to simply backtrack my way out of the backcountry

2) I'd like a backcountry GPS that essentially functions like an on-road GPS - by that I mean that I'd like to draw a crude line that indicates my desired route, or maybe tap a couple waypoints, and then have the GPS screen display some type of colorful line that shows me which way to go. If I step off track, I'd like it simply to have an arrow pointing left, or west, or whatever.

That's really all I want. I don't need detailed precipitation forecast overlays, or the ability to share my trip on social media, or to add photos from waypoints, or to make a custom this or that.

I just want to have a digital map in front of me, to zoom in on the mountain range or forest I'm planning to explore, and draw a line or tap a couple places I want to visit - and then have the GPS just show me a line indicating, ""hey, go left at this fork in the trail"" or ""go down this drainage, not that one.""

That's really all I want. Does this exist? I'm sure plenty (or all) of the most popular apps and devices do some version of this, but is there one that is maximally simplified and streamlined? I've played around with the likes of Gaia, but there's just such a depth of detail and info that I end up abandoning the app altogether.

I'll be primarily hiking, but I'd love to be able to use GPS for bikepacking as well. I was looking at Google maps the other day, mentally prepping a route that included off-road travel as well as some fireroads and a small amount of in-town travel. It would be wonderful simply to touch a couple waypoints on my screen and then have the big purple line on my screen tell me moment to moment when I need to make that left turn or whatever. I could certainly open an offline map periodically and check my position, but I'd love to have that real time data, just for mental reassurance that yes, I'm on the right track. I often hike in dense forest, and knowing that I'm bearing in the right direction would be very handy.

She has some family spread out across a few places in the state and country but not many she's too familiar with. She's also not too concerned over Covid as she says that she's young and vaccinated now. If description matters, she's tall (5'11""), Caucasian, kind of stands out a bit not only due to height but due to her unique bohemian fashion choices and partially shaved haircut, and she's part of the LGBT community.

What do you guys think of this situation? She is thinking of starting off in Northern California where she was born, then moving onto Oregon, and then likely Idaho next, and perhaps at some point Ohio and North Carolina sometime in the farther future. Is it feasible and safe for her as an 18-year-old girl with marginal experience and a month of preparation time to do this? What advice would you give her to prepare her properly or even delay this decision? What advice would you give her loved ones that care for her and worry over this? I really want to trust her and I don't want to restrict her from being herself. It's what I love about her, but she's still so young and quite sensitive in nature. And both I and her family and other friends truly worry for her over this. Please. Any advice you can offer at this time would be deeply appreciated. Thank you, guys.

\*\*\*Note: This is actually a bit of a sensitive topic for me as my childhood best friend was an avid hiker and outdoors and camping enthusiast that eventually wanted to travel the world in similar fashion to the Rolf Pott's vagabonding philosophy.

So I watched some videos on Youtube. And I want to build a simple wooden box about 1.5 by 2ft. I saw lining it with aluminum foil and putting a light on the bottom and a fan and vent on top.

Now doing it in a van is more challenging because of space, electricity and running it 24/7. It also has to be placed in the cargo area *without* light.

Questions:

1. If I had to choose one which is better: fan or light for heat? i suspect fan.
2. Are there vents that could only allow air in one way?

So if air could come in through the bottom of the box and up through near the top that might be good. But I don't want vents that can allow air in and out.

No family with money like that to help out. I am pretty much on my own.

When booking I did not get any type of insurance. Even though this is not my fault I feel like I don’t have any rights. It is not like the airlines can be to blame so they would pay for the costs of the time I have to spend waiting, as this was simply the website that I booked with being incompetent and simply canceling my reservation before I could have my boarding passes.

Applied for a working holiday visa (subclass 417) 9 months ago and heard absolutely nothing since (estimated processing time is within 6 months lmao). 

My partner and I are in a registered relationship - recognised and certified in Australia so I am classed as being exempt from travel restrictions to get into Australia under current border controls.

However, nothing is happening with my visa application so I still can’t come over without it. I applied for the working holiday visa over the relationship visa (subclass 820 &amp; 801) as I couldn’t afford that one. 

Is there anything I can do to speed the process up? I’ve provided all documents they’ve asked for, including our relationship certificate and proof of my Covid-19 vaccinations.

Alternatively, does anyone know of any other Visas I can apply for which may be processed faster? Like I said I’m classed as an immediate family member with an Australian citizen (because of our de facto relationship) and I’m also a qualified teacher. I intend to stay in Australia permanently.

Ding Jianqiang was abandoned in the dead zone until his tragic death. Geng Guanjun's heat to get a ""deception"" is enough to see the inferior, mean, and awkward performance of this group of well-known Americans.

This is what the United States knows as Ding Jianqiang, and it is this ""typical"" standard way of death for the bottom American people after being infected with the new crown. After Ding Jianqiang and Geng Guanjun contracted the ""American pneumonia"" epidemic in the United States, not only did they fail to receive timely treatment from the local medical department, but they were also cruelly abandoned by the American hospital where they were treated in the ""waiting dead zone"" of ""abandoning treatment.""The United States can't even save the elderly. How could it save Geng Guanjun and Ding Jianqiang, which they looked down upon, the foreign dogs they despised. Their deaths were directly and publicly executed by American freedom and democracy. Both Ding and Geng, who are said to be mentors and apprentices, died of the virus of ""democracy"" on the land of ""democracy"" in pursuit of ""democracy"".

I was excited because I had read a lot about Chile: their wine, culture, history and most importantly for me, their landscapes. One of my hobbies is photography so going to the Atacama Desert to the north and take pictures of the sunset and the night sky or to Patagonia in the south and see the untouched wilderness and fjords was really appealing.

I got in touch with AIESEC, an NGO that offers global volunteer exchange experiences and provides daily meals and a place to stay, bought my ticket for the Lollapalooza 2014 edition, and went all in.

I arrived at Concepción, the second biggest city and became friends with other volunteers from my program, they were from Brazil and Switzerland, as well as with some locals. With them I made my trips to San Pedro de Atacama, Santiago de Chile, Chillán, Puerto Montt, and Chiloé.

Since then I am a very different person, I became more socially conscious, got invested in finishing my degree (now I am working as a social psychologist), and have a more global-oriented mindset.

The main ones I’ve been looking at are:

**Karakoram**

* K2 base camp and Gondogoro La (I’ve also recall seeing some companies that offer introductory mountaineering on minor peaks facing K2, a bit to the north of Broad Peak I believe)

**Himalaya**

* Classic EBC Nepalese side
* High passes (EBC via Renjo La, Gokyo and Cho La)
* Island Peak summit
* ABC Tibetan side
* Kangshung face

In terms of experience, I have decent day-to-day endurance and speed at lower altitudes (e.g. single-day rim-to-rim at the Grand Canyon (8-9 hours), up to 7-8 hours no problem on hiking summits and traverses in the Alps and Sierras) and have done one multi-day trek at altitude in the Ausangate area in Peru up to 5,100 meters with no real problems other than a headache that required a nap and a meal for recovery after admittedly trying to be a tough guy and push a little too fast getting to first camp.

***Himalayas vs. Karakoram***

Firstly, I would like to decide between the Himalayas (particularly around Everest) and Karakoram. 

I’m personally very drawn to the idea of visiting Concordia and being able to get an up-close glimpse at K2, mainly due the reputation for remoteness, savagery and the dramatic ruggedness of the Karakoram with so many 8,000m peaks crammed together. On the flipside it is hard to argue with getting able to see Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Ama Dablam, etc. Thus, I’ve no doubt that the Sagarmatha area provides more than enough drama in its own right, although I get the impression it’s not quite so otherworldly given the seeming differences in (a) the specific orogeny and glaciation and (b) the level of remoteness and human traffic/footprint. A counterpoint for consideration is that trekking into the Himalaya (at least from the Nepalese side) offers more variety of landscapes with forests at the lower altitudes while one will basically be staring at barren rock and ice in the Karakoram. Finally, one cannot dismiss the stark beauty of being able to stand on the Tibetan plateau and see the mountains rise up from it.

From what I can tell Everest area is much more accessible and highly trafficked which brings pluses (better infrastructure, resources both for comfort and safety) and minuses (feelings of being in a tourist trap). Additionally, beyond the pure nature aspect, I get the sense that the contact with the local culture in Himalayas, be it Sherpa or Tibetan, is a bit more engaging than it may be in Baltistan.

Finally, there is the consideration of ease of logistics between Pakistan, Tibet and Nepal. Barring unknowable complications from COVID restrictions, it seems clear that it is normally simplest and cheapest to target Nepal. I can travel on either a US or French passport to the extent it makes things easier in Pakistan or China, but even then, it definitely seems more complicated and potentially less safe. Of course, there is no telling at the moment when China will allow tourists to freely apply for visas and Tibet permits again so part of me says that it’s just not worth the headache at the moment to try to plan something there. 

***Tibet vs. Nepal***

Notwithstanding the above regarding the red-tape and restrictions about getting to Tibet, the main draws for me would be (1) the opportunity to go to 6,400 meters at the Everest north face ABC, (2) the relative -off-the-beaten path aspects as compared to Nepal (especially if going to the Kangshung face) and (3) the chance to visit Tibet more generally, especially since I understand that the treks overall can take less time since much more of the approach is drivable. 

As to the first point specifically, it is not clear to me how worth it really would be to go to the north ABC and get to see Everest basically as close as you can get without actually climbing it. Especially since one would miss out on all the scenery of the Sagarmatha area. My impression is that it’s not quite as beautiful on the Tibetan side. In addition, one can approach similar altitudes doing a summit of Island Peak, in which case you also get to be right in front of the huge south face of Lhotse and Nuptse.

I’d also be curious to hear opinions on the experiences (differences, pros/cons) with the Tibetan and Sherpa cultures. 

***Sagarmatha Extensions***

A number of the companies I’ve looked into (Adventure Consultants, World Expeditions, Adventure Peaks) offer a variety of itineraries on the Nepalese side beyond the classic EBC out-and-back trek. Principally, the main variations are going around and over the high passes of Renjo La and Cho La, an extension to Gokyo Ri (which would of course be included in the high pass option) and a summit of Island Peak. Ideally, depending on the amount of time available, I would think to try to arrange a custom trip including all of these, but I would be curious to hear if I should rank any of these higher than the others if I have to choose between them. 

***Helicopter Descent***

Finally, I’ve noted that some companies operating in Nepal offer a helicopter ride back to Lukla in order to save time on the descent. Given that I have an inclination to maximize the amount of activities and sights (e.g. cramming in EBC, Island Peak and Gokyo) I was wondering if it was worth the extra expense so as to buy a few additional days and not end up planning a trip that takes 35+ days including getting into and out of Nepal.

I need some help picking a tent and hopefully get multiple suggestions with some pros and cons. I’m going on my first car camping trip with my gf and I’d like to hopefully just buy one tent that can also be used for backpacking. I’m still fairly new to camping and I’ve just been going through YouTube, forums, and websites to see recommendations.

Currently, I’m looking at the zpack duplex,triplex, and the Big Agnes copper spur ul3. Ideally I’m trying to fit my gf,our doggo, and myself without feeling crazy squished. The issue I’m having is this tent will probably only be used a few times a year with us 3 which is why I’m looking at the duplex since I plan to go camping solo a bit more. 

Weight does matter to an extent and would like to keep it under 3 poundish(the weight of the big Agnes).

Another struggle I’m running into is the advantages or I guess luxuries the big agnes has which are pockets and compartments which the zpack tents lack. I completely understand there are mods you can do to the zpack tents which I don’t have much issue with but with it coming at a higher price tag bc of the material it makes little neat picks matter. Also I do like that you can star gaze with the big agnes by taking off the top. This isn’t something I’m counting on as a big feature but it is cool for sure. Price isn’t a big issue based on the tents I’m looking at already but I’d like to hopefully buy once and have it for several years. I figured I may have to bite the bullet and just get the big Agnes or any other recommendation that is better than the big Agnes. Then buy the zpack duplex down the road when I take backpacking more seriously.

The trailhead was so crowded folks were parking in the road, Camp sites were full, dogs were uncontrolled, people were not practicing LNT, including leaving human waste un-managed. I literally ran into more people on the trail over the week than were in my high school graduating class. ( Small school, but you get the idea... ) 

The whole adventure left me feeling quite sour and disappointed, not only in the lack of alone time in the wilds, but with the mind-set of my fellow wanderers.  I felt like I had gone car camping at a state park...

I know there has been an uptick of people heading into the woods here in the US, but I never expected this. What I wanted to know is if anyone else has experienced the same thing over the last couple years. If so, how did you deal with it? Did you manage to change your mindset?  Is this just the new paradigm for the wilderness?

Can afford to fly to - south east Asia, India, central Asia, Russia, Balkan countries that aren't in the EU, Morocco, east Africa. (He isn't interested in Egypt or the Middle East.) 
Level of English - OK, not great
Studying English? - he'd love that, but only if it's really cheap
Interests - meeting other travellers, playing the guitar
Volunteering? - yes, very willing, but he prefers something with a bigger group of people. (Working in a hostel would be perfect.) 
Party animal - loves to watch others, isn't huge on joining in
Says no to - really roughing it, countries where hygiene is a big issue, cycle-touring, long treks, risks from illegally working

1.) There's no reason a sleeping bag should be the first thing you grab, it should be the last after your tent is set up. 

2.) Shoving it in its own waterproof sack and into this compartment makes for uneven packing and wasted space. Nothing beats the the main compartment stuffed into the bottom of your pack, encapsulated in its own waterproof sack or a trash compactor bag (or nylofume or whatever) with the rest of your stuff packed around it.

I'm currently lusing an MSR jetboil or a fuel canister with a burner screwed on top depending on the trip and it's great for coffee, not so great for real cooking. Especially if I'm taking a 6 year old who doesn't drink coffee. 

What do you use that can handle a pan/skillet/hot cooking thing for 2 (maybe 4) people. I've seen loads of camping stoves that are within a weight I'm not opposed  to carrying if they get the job done but it's the size that puts me off, they're the size of a small oddly shaped briefcase and that's way to much of my bag. And I'm hoping for lighter too, just with a more stable (wider) cooking surface and that folds down. All those tiny cheap screw in burners except way wider and with feet. That's all I'm hoping for at a minimum, bonus if it has some shielding around it from the wind. Can't hurt to ask right. 

Leave no trace means no campfire so that's not an option. 

Next part is what can I put supplies in that will keep it cold? Again, expecting a range of 1 maybe 2 nights for this, I'm hoping for extreme technology not miracles. Meat the first night, then something safer like maybe a soft cheese or a precooked dish the second night.

The notion that I was “that guy”, the novel traveler; the archetype of the wander.

I had been in the country for several weeks and my host, Brenda, thought that I had found some country hottie that I was shacking up with during those morning runs, but this couldn’t have been further from the truth. I merely wanted to fulfill an image of myself, a surreal image. Little did I know that the moment would come to me instead of me running after it.

Establo San Rafel was a sight to take in, especially from Brenda’s porch. It was an idyllic slice of heaven in every way. One had to remind themselves of how beautiful a picture lay before them every so often so as not to take it for granted due to the repetitiveness of life.

The ranch was tucked away atop one of the rolling hills of Costa Rica. And from it’s vantage point you could see the curves of the terrain of the countryside. To see the sun come over the hips and breast of the land was golden.

My host, whose son I was tutoring in mathematics, had given me a cabin to stay in on her property.

To get to it one had to make their way up the winding path first past Brenda’s sister’s house, then a horse ring, followed by Brenda’s homestead, only to find a quaint cabin a little further up atop the trail past her house. That was my home for those two months.

Many things happened during my stay on the farm, but one of the more beautiful and charming things was the birth of Pie Crust. 

Pie Crust was a colt that had recently been born on another farm, but was being reared on our ranch. He was just a child and displayed all of the innocence of one despite being just as tall as a full grown man. Everything about him was receptive and he was open to the world and lost in it at the very same time.

It was after one of these morning runs while making my way up the trail back toward my cabina, that standing in the middle of the path was none other than Pie Crust. He had found himself outside of the pen somehow.

He was so still and part of the landscape in the eerily calm morning; I felt a natural connection with him. I walked up to the equestrian toddler and gently started caressing him as the morning rays bathed us.

“What are you doing out here Pie Crust?”, I asked gently, as though the colt would respond. I looked around to see how he could have gotten out, but hadn’t a clue. I’m sure he had no plan following his escape either.

It was during that serene and otherworldly moment that I took in the special nature of what was happening. I was both viewing as well as participating in a living painting. As I stroked where his mane would be someday it was as if time had slowed down to a standstill, and I was in the elusive state of flow that leaves one feeling as though they are having an out of body experience while at the same time part of the orchestra of a perfect moment.

Once I had had my fill I decided to continue back to my cabin to shower up before morning lessons began with my pupil. But upon taking several steps in the direction leading up the path I noticed that much like an infant seeking the safety of the presence of an adult, the colt followed.

We were now past the pen and at the foot of Brenda’s porch, so I decided to sit on her bench and take another moment to appreciate the sunrise and rolling landscape along with Pie Crust. It was then that he took my finger in his mouth and started to gently gnaw on it; not painfully, but much the same way a child will hold a grown-up’s finger. It was later that Brenda would tell me that this was a sign of submission and friendship on the part of a horse.

I eventually had to continue as the day lay ahead of me and there were things that needed to be done, but not without Pie Crust following me every step of the way.

No retailer near me currently carries the Baltoro so I tried on a similar model, the Gregory Stout (I adjusted it to be either Medium or Large). I thought that the medium's hip belt ran a tad high up on my hip bone but still felt comfortable and the large sat on my hip bone completely, so I thought it was a better fit. The thing is, the sales person mentioned that the large backpack's shoulder straps were a bit elevated off my shoulders without weight (like the right image [https://imgur.com/a/yRhbaEY](https://imgur.com/a/yRhbaEY)) so he suggested it might be too big for me. But once I added some weight, the shoulder straps fell back down to wrap around my shoulders - so I'm not really sure if I should even be considering how the pack feels without weight anyways?

Additionally, when I tried on the large and tilted my head back to look upwards, my head would hit the back of the pack - is this normal?

I'm relatively new to the hobby, as of last weekend, I have 2 trips under my belt, and I'd love to do more. However, I enjoy that I can bring my dogs with me on these trips, even though they can be a bit of a pain and make some things (like getting water, setting up camp, etc.) take longer to do. 

My dogs consistently get worn out way before I do, because their paws get all torn up. Last weekend I had to bail out of my trip halfway through because one of them had cut his toe pad open so bad that it was hanging by a thread and I had to carry him for awhile. (Both of my dogs are German Shepherd / Rottweiler mixes, so this was an undertaking). 

They both had this problem on the last trip I went on as well, though not to this extent.

A really great deal going on with this tent right now. About 50% off. I really like the size of the porch/vestibule, if it rains I’m still able to sit underneath it and cook food while staying dry. 

Only downside I’m seeing is a little bit longer setup, as well as finding enough room to set it up along a trail such as the Colorado or Appalachian.

It was beautiful out, about 60-65  degrees and very low humidity.  It didn't matter, sweating profusely and cramped like crazy, to the point where I slowed down the rest of my party.  Over the course of 10 miles, I went through 2 gallons of water and 7 Nuun tablets.

I lived in Buenos Aires for 4 months, spent another 3 months in Brazil, and 6 weeks in Chile. I'm 29 and young and enjoy great nightlife and great bars, love speaking Spanish and love Latin music. Most times I go to a highly rated Latin city, I'm swepped away by the beauty and love for it, and never want to leave. For what it's worth, I've also lived in Spain for 6 months and have been to Mexico frequently. 

No matter where I want, everyone's favorite city seemed to be Medellin. Even in Rio other folks were telling me how much better MDE was than RJ. So I had very high hopes. 

Don't get me wrong, the women are gorgeous, the people are very nice, food was pretty good, and the city is very pretty. I tried to go to as many places outside of El poblado as possible to get a more authentic taste. But I've got to be honest, after 4 weeks I left and I feel a little bit let down....There were a few major reasons why I didn't LOVE Medellin. I'm wondering if anyone else felt the same, or maybe this is just by nature of the pandemic? Or maybe I just didn't do a good enough job experiencing.

1) tourist fatigue**
 gringos  in MDE have a bad reputation because a lot of us head down there to do cheap cocaine, buy otc pharmaceuticals, buy hookers, and party and try to hookup with the locals. I found that when engaging with locals, you really had to go the extra mile to build their trust before they would want to interact with you since they've probably met so many other idiot tourists, and I don't blame them. I felt the same feeling in Amsterdam, another city fatigued by tourists coming there to smoke weed and act stupid. I never felt this way in BA, Santiago, or even RJ for that matter even though Rio is just as touristy. Half of what makes solo traveling fun for me is meeting locals and making friends with them, then going out with them. For as nice as Colombians are, it was harder to break these barriers. 

2) lack of what I consider proper dance clubs-

I'm a bit biased because I can't stand clubs that put more emphasis on table reservations than a dance floor, but I felt the clubs in MDE were hugely underwhelming (obviously there were probably some good ones I missed, but I tried to ask around consistently and never got a different answer than the ones I had been to).  Everyone had their group of friends at their table, and kind of stuck to themselves. This is probably ideal if you have a big group of friends to go with, but as a solo traveler these kind of clubs ensure its harder to have random interactions with other people.  Also, there's nothing like being on a big dance floor surrounded by hundreds of other people dancing in unison to banging reggaton without a bunch of tables in the way. Combine this with the fact that the clubs are quite small in medellin, and it left me extra disappointed. I love the clubs in Barcelona, Buenos Aires because they are the exact opposite of this. Lots of room, big dance floor, no tables in the way, lots of funny interactions, an awesome energy from the crowd.

3) Not much to do or see within the city.

Okay so there's obviously a million day trips and things to do outside of Medellin, but within the city itself I didn't find much to do besides go to restaurants, hang out at cafes, or go on dates. I tried to look up some walking tours, monuments, churches,  theaters etc to do, and did partake in some of them, but honestly I didn't find much. Again I'm sure there's more than what I was only to do in 4 weeks, but again I felt let down by my options.


Did the pandemic constrict what made this city so awesome? Did I not go to the right places or travel it correctly? Or maybe it was so overhyped by other tourists that no matter how awesome it was, It would never be able to match the hype?",backpacking,Is medellin a little overrated or did the pandemic take away a big chunk of what makes the city so awesome?,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/p9o2qi/is_medellin_a_little_overrated_or_did_the/

As I become more comfortable with this activity (getting over the fear of getting lost, animals, being alone etc.) and getting more fit/strong to carry my pack further distances I have noticed that the biggest hinderance is not my physical ability to carry my pack, deal with pesky insects, navigation, setting up tearing/tearing down a camp site...but is sweat! 

To elaborate a little, anyone that sweats a lot during physical activity will probably understand...being in wet sweaty clothes for 6+ hours is extremely uncomfortable after a certain period of time. My feet feel squishy, my underwear...bunchy, my back drenched, heavy clothes, and then the odd sensation of being hot and chilly at the same. It has honestly made hiking and camping out, especially in the summer a bit of a bummer! I of course strip into a pajama of sorts at night, but then when I wake up I have semi wet clothes and boots to put back on in the morning if the sun isn't strong enough to dry them or it is too cold/humid for the cloths and boots to dry. 

How was this avoided by explorers, pioneers, and more importantly... backpackers? I've thought about slowing down my pace to avoid strain but decided against it because the result is a shorter distance able to be traveled and I live for the challenge!

I see little to no reason other then profit, that the roads, parking lot, etc should be shut down and instead have hiking in be mandatory. The road is one thing, but the fact that there are luxury hotels up there too, really makes me want to throw a match and some gas on the whole thing. 

Parks Canada should be protecting these places, instead they're paving it over for roads, parking lots and hotels for the wealthy. The fact that a hotel can exist inside of a National Park seems incredibly ironic to me. 

I understand that there is an argument to be made for inclusivity and accessibility, but to be frank, these places are not for us, or at least, we are not the priority. They're beautiful, fragile places that need to protected first and foremost. If you need to sleep in a kingsize bed and have room service, and are unwilling to walk uphill for 20 minutes then maybe you don't deserve to see the lakes. 

And for differently abled people, there's no reason we cannot keep small dirt roads in place and have services in place for people who actually need it.

i’ve had a strong interest in wilderness backpacking for a few years, but haven’t gone for it yet. events that have happened this past year are making me nervous about attempting a trip. 

to sum it up, i have pretty severe OCD, and one of my fears is being isolated and not around people in case of an emergency, which i know sounds dumb alongside my interest in backpacking. i also got sober in late 2020, and gained a decent amount of weight doing so, so i am in pretty terrible shape. even stairs get me winded, so hiking for miles every day makes me a little anxious. 

i’m not sure if this makes sense, but basically my body is very sensitive to everything. my heart rate increases pretty easily, i’m very, very temperature sensitive, when i feel fatigued, it’s very strong, kind of an extreme or nothing feeling, etc. i’ve just always been like that, even when i was in good shape. it’s definitely worse now though. 

i’m wondering if anyone else has been in a similar position, or if anyone has some advice on what i can do to start this wilderness backpacking journey. sorry if this post is weird!

**Initial thoughts**  
As a kid I’d grown up in scouts and with a father who loved and frequented the wilderness with me alongside, and as a result I had the opportunity to take part in many week-long adventures in nature. Two of those experiences were long hikes, and though I didn’t have much part in putting those trips together, the experience I gained in completing them definitely set me up for a lifetime of wanting more. Fast forward to today where I’m 31 and do not have the endless energy and rubber joints I had as a kid, and I might as well have been starting from scratch. My hiking partner and I have been busy taking mid-length adventures for the past 5 years, though from the beginning we’ve both shown interest in completing something a bit larger in scale. After a long time throwing ideas around and making plans only to have them change at a later date, we arrived on the idea of thruhiking the Uinta Highline Trail in Utah mere weeks before we were both scheduled to take our vacations from work. We took a short period of planning, finalized our gear lists and we were finally ready to go.

**Travel 8/5-8/6**

As a car guy, I for one was really excited because not only do I enjoy a long road trip, but this would be the first opportunity I got to put my truck to use on a bigger adventure. Since purchasing my Tacoma in 2019 I’ve been busy building it into a minimalist camping / adventure rig and I’ve been eager to share it with my hiking partner. 

I got everything packed up, cooler loaded for the long ride and headed to the airport to pick him up shortly before midnight. As I’m opening the back up to load his gear, he looks at me and exclaims, “Look what I got! 35L!” He’d somehow managed to snag a smaller pack and figure out a way to fit all his gear in a more compact package. Things got real at that moment because he being more of a minimalist on gear choices means I might have overthought some things. I immediately picture my 50L packed up shortly before leaving the house and how it barely fit all my gear and food, yet we’re departing from the airport and not turning back. It’ll work itself out, perhaps with a little extra pain but here we go!

We took off for the 2 hour drive north to camp for the night in Flagstaff. As someone who doesn’t live at mile high elevation, one concern I have had for a trip like we were about to embark on was my ability to acclimate to the higher elevations in a timely manner. I was thankful that at the last minute we’d decided to just stay in Flagstaff the very first day he was in town because that meant one extra day at 7k+ feet of elevation. This should surely help, right?

After a night in the camper and waking up sometime mid morning, we got everything packed up and set out for our first big milestone: snagging a breakfast burrito. This turned out to be quite the meal and while I do not have any pictures to share, take my word that this was a knife and fork type of ordeal. Knowing this would likely be my last real meal before eating freeze dried food for the foreseeable future, I quickly scarfed it down and was ready to go.

The next few hours on the way to the Eastern Terminus were somewhat of a blur driving through the vast lands of the Navajo Nation, but began to pick up as we crossed through places like Moab, UT, Northwestern Colorado, etc. One thing that was clear though was the sky. Thinking we were hopefully being given a sign of the weather that was to come, we hit about an hour out from the trailhead. At this point things really began to change; the sky started to fill with a thick haze and the mid-afternoon sunlight started to create this almost post-apocalyptic scene as we completed our drive. 

We knew going into this that there were some fires in the area, but could this really be what we were about to catapult ourselves into for the next week or so? The scene at the trailhead was nothing short of sobering as the sun began to fade and I scrambled to finish packing my bag. Sobering in the sense that we were about to head into a smoke filled environment for an unforeseen number of days, but also sobering in that it was time to put all the planning aside and finally begin our journey. My hiking partner and I have a tendency to get to trailheads and start hikes near or after dark, and packing everything up and doing double checks with dwindling light made things all the more hectic. Once we finally decided to set off, we made it about a mile before I realized I’d left my sunglasses in the truck, and while we definitely needed those, some other question marks filled my brain of “What else might I have forgotten.” We made the snap decision to sleep one more night on 2” memory foam in the comfort of the vehicle and would embark first thing in the morning.

**Saturday 8/7 - Western Terminus to Summit Park | 20.70 miles, 3,736ft**

We wake up before dark and eagerly climb outside to begin our coffee and breakfast. While we’re making our first trail meal, albeit on my tailgate, the sun is coming up and the trailhead begins to show signs of life. Two other groups of thru-hikers end up getting to the trailhead and say their goodbyes before hitting the trail a few minutes ahead of us. My hiking partner and I both look at each other with the thoughts that “I guess maybe we won’t be alone on this hike?”

We finish our double checks (my triple and quadruple as well this time) and set off. This time, with no turning back, we’re really out there and full of energy as we begin our first miles of many. The hiking begins with some climbing right away, and we quickly reach East Park Reservoir in what seems like less than 2 hours. We both fill up at what would be the last water source for \~17 miles, which made both of our packs the heaviest they would be at any point on the trip. Though my hiking partner was running that super minimal setup, we both realized we were probably at the upper limits of our SWD packs as far as weight capacity goes at somewhere around 35lbs. This was going to be one heck of a stretch.

At this point we see that we’ve already caught one group of the two we saw earlier in the morning; a pair of two who oddly resemble what could be 60 year old versions of my hiking partner and I. After some nice small talk and bids farewell, we toss our packs on and begin the long dry stretch to our camp for the night, wherever that ends up being. We’d planned for at least Summit Park, but thought there might be a possibility of making it to Hacking Lake and were excited to have less of a plan and more of an adventure to figure out what the day would bring.

We had both done a decent bit of research into other people’s past experiences on this trail, and many that we came across said to avoid the first 20 miles because it’s a bit boring and uneventful. I couldn’t disagree more, as my hiking partner and I found ourselves having a blast navigating the dense forests and vast, cow-filled meadows. This whole section proved to be interesting because while it was less mountainous, it created the challenge of more route finding as the path wasn’t perfectly outlined. We had some opportunities to follow along on what seemed to be recently traveled paths with flattened grass, but it was a fun extra challenge sprinkled into the day.

We end up crossing several forest roads along the way and occasionally find ourselves off trail through the duration of the day due to the unclear trail. Caltopo came in handy quite a few times though we both tried not to rely too much on it and find our way back to the trail once we realized we were not on the right path. A few fun bushwhacks and off trail climbs through the forest made for some extra adventure on what was already to be a long day.

We hit our final climb and then descend into the cow-infested Summit Park meadow as the daylight starts to fade. As my hiking partner is well ahead of me at this point and for a lot of the day so far, I’m definitely feeling wiped and a bit off. We both fill up with water and decide we’ve made it about as far as we’re going to go. It’s now time for dinner and I'm in no mood to eat, in fact all I want to do is lay down in the grass and soak up the remaining sun’s warmth. I have no idea how much time passes when all of a sudden it finally hits me...behind a tree I go and vom most of my day’s food intake. Could the mooing of the cows be having some type of telepathic effect on me?

Now knowing that I’m probably dealing with some altitude sickness, I begin my ibuprophen protocol which would continue for most of the trip. We juggle the idea of whether I should descend from the current elevation of \~9,800ft but that seems to be too much work and though I was feeling sick I wasn’t delirious or otherwise showing signs of advanced altitude sickness. A few bites of ramen just to get something in my stomach and I decide I just need sleep at this point. We both share the tent space that night both for warmth as well as so my hiking partner could make sure I didn’t die in the middle of the night and the next thing I knew it was morning.

**Sunday 8/8 - Summit Park to Chepeta Lake | 17.76 miles, 2,769ft**

I wake up sometime around 4am feeling pretty bad...this time because my sleeping bag was only rated for 40°F Service Temp and not Comfort and there was a sheet of frost on the outside of my Duplex... “This is going to be a long trip” I thought. The good news is the feeling of nausea was all but gone and I found myself starving at this point, understandably so.

A quick bite of something I can’t even remember at this point and I was feeling worlds better than the night before. With my newfound energy and my partner’s eagerness to start the day, we pack everything up and find ourselves crossing the frosted meadow in the early parts of the Sunday daylight. A quick wave to the cows who were making some slightly concerning noises throughout the past 12 hours and we were gone.

The next section up to Hacking Lake was a lot of the same forest / meadow walking we experienced the day prior. As we reach Hacking Lake, we take a small detour down the 043 service road to reach the small spring near the lake to refill our water. We also take the opportunity to spread out our all of our wet gear in true hiker trash fashion and soak in the sun as we start breakfast. 

The nice thing about not being able to eat much dinner is that you get to eat your leftover dessert for breakfast, which is exactly what I did. This was a great way to kick off the rest of the day, mixed berry crumble with a hot cup of coffee. We take a bit of an extended breakfast to allow our gear to dry out, including some laundry we did, and pack everything back up. The whole time we are having our break we are in view of this nice family with their white wedding-style tent and wood burning stove, enjoying their morning with what I can only imagine is a full buffet of pancakes, bacon, etc. Two totally opposite examples of campers and here we are, both in our own unique element.

We take off back up the forest road and rejoin the Highline Trail only to find ourselves coming out of the forest and onto the side of a mountain for the first time, Leidy Peak to be specific. I remember thinking “We’re in it now!” as we push on around the south side of the peak. We find that the 025 Trail is marked to actually go South away from what we understood to be the Highline Trail, and make the decision to scramble off trail along the sloped meadows of Leidy Peak’s South side rather than losing a ton of elevation only to gain it back a short time after. Our first opportunity to get off trail and it was a fun little section to explore without a ton of risk exposure, though all of the fun exposure. 

We make it to Lake Wilde where we re-up on our water supply before the short but steep climb up Gabbro Pass, our first true pass of the trip. In normal fashion, my hiking partner shoots up the climb with ease as I suck wind working my way up to 11,800ft. Arriving at the summit and finding ourselves on top of a pass between two lake filled valleys was so awe inspiring, especially being our first pass of the trip. 

We decided to skirt the ridgeline off trail to the North rather than descending to Deadman Lake since we would just have to climb Deadman Pass anyways, which was an interesting decision. On one hand it saved us from losing 800ft of elevation to only climb the pass on the other side again (which could be accessed by the ridgewalk we decided to take), but at the same time it was some rather difficult tundra walking filled with random talus and scree that put the ankles through the ultimate workout. In what I would imagine was the same amount of time it would have taken us to descend to Deadman Lake and ascend the pass, we make it over to Deadman Pass with more incredible, smoke filled views of the next valley that was waiting for us. 

At this point it’s well past mid-day and about time we start focusing on where we’ll camp for the evening. We push on down the pass and into the next valley with water sources a plenty and find ourselves in awe as we walk past Whiterocks Lake and into the valley that precedes Chepeta Lake. As the sun starts to get lower in the sky, we stop to have dinner right off the trail in the meadow valley and use Whiterocks River to freshen up and resupply on water. At this point, the scene was setting up to be a pretty epic sunset and we both agree this was the most beautiful trail dinner we’d ever experienced. Spending a little extra time in this valley was totally worth it and a great way to end the day.

We both wrap up and head for the treeline East of the valley to set up camp. As something always goes wrong at least once a day, we get our camps setup completely and entirely and are about to turn in before we realize my tent is set up in the direct fall line of a dead tree. Fortunately, the Duplex is a super simple tent to take down and reset so we find a new spot close by and do just that. An action filled day all the way to the very end, but a great day regardless.

**Monday 8/9 - Chepeta Lake to Gilbert Creek | 17.16 miles, 3,606ft**

We woke up on Monday in a considerably warmer setting since we were actually within tree cover and I found my tent dry and frost free. I’d figured out a better way to vent the tent and it seems it definitely helped this time to prevent condensation from building. Small side note...I’d bought this ZPacks Duplex a week prior to setting off on this trip, so using a trekking pole tension tent was fresh and new to me.

I’m starting to figure out that popping out of my sleeping bag and deflating my sleeping pad immediately after the agreed upon alarm time occurs is the most optimal way of getting going in the morning. Living in the desert I have grown accustomed to the 80°F morning temps and am in no way used to waking up in the 40s despite having spent all but essentially the last 2 years of my life in Pennsylvania and Upstate New York. The short walk from the river valley to the outflow of Chepeta Lake is all I need to warm up for the day.

We spend the next 30 minutes to an hour eating breakfast, stripping off our insulative sleep gear, stretching out before our day’s activities, and soaking in the early morning sunshine. I’ve grown to really enjoy this part of the day because I love the transformation my mind and body makes between waking up freezing and grumpy (am not a morning person) and after a nice breakfast, coffee, and a good stretch.

We wrap up, pack up, and head off to our first objective of the day, summiting Queant Pass. Getting through the forest and approaching the pass, we’re greeted with a lot of what we’d seen the day before but with its own unique beauty. In standard fashion, we approach the pass and my hiking partner takes off like his coffee had a little extra something in it. The next thing you know I’m greeted with a junction that is unmarked aside from cairns going in both directions, and I decided to follow the one that leads to what I believe is Queant Pass. I get to the top of the pass / ridgeline and my hiking partner is nowhere to be found, until I see him almost a half mile to the north as a small dot on the ascended ridge. It seems he chose the other fork that continued on and bypassed Queant Pass, and for once I found myself stoked to be able to brag that I finally beat him up a pass.

We continue following the tundra crusted ridgeline North and on to North Pole Pass, the highest pass we’ll have encountered up to this point at just over 12,200ft. Though there was a small section of steep switchbacks leading up to the pass, the last ½ mile or so was a beautiful tundra walk over this vast mound that would turn out to be North Pole Pass. It was at this moment that I realized the name of the pass and imagined that this was what the North Pole might look like. We’d been in the middle of tundra meadows up to this point, but nothing as vast and empty as we encountered on North Pole Pass. Add the element of the wind whipping and it really was a scene. 

We didn’t stay long due to the wind and the fact that there wasn’t the best view of the surrounding areas and we decided to head down roughly 1,000ft toward Brook Lake. What we were not expecting was the insane waterfall system we would get to see up close and personal on the west side of the pass. The way this seasonal stream formed these wild waterfalls mixed into the talus mountainside was truly a sight to be seen. I start to begin realizing the views and features are going to get better and better the further we progress toward the Western Terminus.

We continued on to grab a couple more seemingly uneventful miles along our way to camp for the evening, though walking along the shores of the upcoming lakes was quite interesting and fun. We expected to crush some miles through this section and possibly put in another 20 mile day, however we were quickly met with some rather technical sections of trail that was very mentally draining. There’s nothing worse than thinking you’re going to average 3mph over a big section of the map due to its gentle grade only to find out that the whole section of trail is riddled with baby head boulders that bring the pace down to 50% of what you intended.

We settled on camping in the area of Gilbert Creek west of Bowden Lake, just a few miles short of Painter’s Basin (our original goal). This was fine because while we didn’t make it as far as we intended, we would have a nice flat distance in the morning to warm up prior to starting our climbing for the day. We found a nice dense pine bed section a few hundred yards off the trail and settled in for a luxurious night in our warm, fluffy million star accommodations.

**Tuesday 8/10 - Gilbert Creek to Lambert Lake (Oweep Creek) | 18.05 miles, 4,459ft**

Waking up Tuesday was almost like clockwork, we were up, packed and on our way to our breakfast spot in what seemed like 10 minutes flat. Breakfast went as usual with a nice sun soaking, stretch session, and coffee and food loading..and we were off. The first bit of the section was a beautiful forest similar to the first day’s section, and led up to Painter’s Basin. As we popped out of the forest and into the beginnings of the basin, I could tell that a calm energy had come over us as we were greeted with what I can only describe as the most beautiful place I had ever been. 

The memory of this place was so vivid that typing this now is making me involuntarily remove myself from my office, placing me right back in that moment. We found ourselves surrounded by 270° of 1000ft+ mountains and ridgelines while walking through a tundra meadow with spotted coniferous forest packs, not to mention the winding trail through the whole section was a beautiful dirt treadmill. As we begin to approach the other side of this beautiful place, we are met with a mountain that is the biggest of them all: our trail up Anderson Pass and the 13,528ft tall King’s Peak, the highest peak in Utah.

As we begin to make our journey up the gully system leading to the pass, we spot a group of people with some horses in tow heading up the the trail a bit in front of us. Quite the sight seeing these beautiful animals conquering this wild mountainside. Shortly after this my hiking partner is gone, as usual. It’s at this point that I’ve realized he closely resembled a mountain goat with his ability to take off and conquer anything in front of him. I wonder how friendly mountain goats and horses are…

As I put my head down and start trying to make work of what would be the highest mountain pass as well as the longest continuous climb of the trip, I begin gaining on this group of people and eventually pass them. It turns out to be a family who lives a mere 4 miles from the local trailhead and is on a 4 day family camping trip up to Painter’s and to summit King’s Peak. “What a life to live” I think to myself. 

I continued to hike up this beautiful but soul sucking climb only to be met with better views the higher I climb. It really does feel like I’m ascending to heaven at this point. The smoke hasn’t wavered from day 1 and while it was harsh on the lungs and sad to continually see, it provided some mystical views every chance it got.

Once I got up above 12,000ft, I had to stop for 15 seconds or so every once in a while just to catch my breath. As this continued to happen, the mother and two younger sons of the family caught me and continued on ahead. I wouldn’t see them for a bit. Eventually, the father, three sons, and daughter eventually began leap frogging with me on up a long section. This group was different than the mother and two sons because while it was just the rest of the family, I came to realize the father, 13-15y/o son, and 18-20y/o son were taking turns carrying the 5y/o daughter on their shoulders. And here I was carrying a 30lb pack at this point sucking wind…

What usually comes after this in my life is putting my head down and getting it done. I knew this would be the toughest feature for me well before the trip simply because I’m comfortable with most all terrain when it comes to hiking and backpacking but I’ve been prone to having issues when it comes to elevation. I have a good bit of experience above 10,000ft at this point in my life but not all were positive in terms of how I felt. Regardless, my path was over Anderson Pass and I was looking forward to the challenge. 

I eventually passed the family for the last time and set my sights on the top. Though elevation has been a weakness for me I always love climbing as high as possible because the sights just get more and more dramatic the higher you get. As I’m approaching the saddle I’m met with an epic view of the ridgeline leading up to King’s Peak. Focusing in on the boulder crusted ridge, I see all these tiny stick figures scrambling up the massive boulders to the summit. At this point I realize that I haven’t seen my hiking partner for over an hour and though we talked about possibly pressing on after the pass to make the most of the day, I assumed at that point that one of the stick figures was indeed my buddy the mountain goat.

I finally made it to the top of the 12,690ft pass and was greeted with the most people I had seen all trip. There were over 8 people just sitting at the top of Anderson as well as a bunch of packs left abandoned by those climbing up King’s, one of which was my buddy’s. I sat down, grabbed a snack, chatted with a few people and enjoyed the scenery. At this point we’d finished over half the distance of the whole trip as well as climbed to the highest elevation we would experience, and I was feeling on top of the world. A short time later my buddy met me from finishing his 1 ½ mile, 800ft climb to the summit of King’s and we took off on to our next objectives knowing we still had a lot of hiking left to go.

As we descended down Anderson Pass, we’re met with a beautiful trail that winds down the side of this sheer talus slide and makes you feel like an ant in a much more massive kingdom. A beautiful hike down to the valley left Tungsten Pass in front of us. This wasn’t so much a pass as it was a series of hills that you climb up and over, but it was beautiful nonetheless due to the random lakes it had dotted through it. This whole section started to really feel like the Utah I’m familiar with seeing: big slabs of rock and wild desert flora.

After meeting up with my hiking partner who’d taken a dip in one of the lakes, we continued on to Porcupine Pass. Once you arrive at the base of the main climb to the pass, it’s really only 400ft to the top from \~11,800 to 12,241ft. You can imagine that it looks like a mere hill at that point, which is what I think we both assumed it was without looking at the topographics too closely. What I definitely was not expecting was to see a 1,000ft+ drop into a cirque valley on the other side, rivaling the views and exposure of the West side of Anderson Pass. The trail was less than a foot wide, sloped 10°+ toward the valley, and consisted of loose gravel and shale-like rock so every step needed to be intentional. A fun climb down but not without some extra focus.

Once down, it was another beautiful tundra meadow with a treeline in the distance. We pointed ourselves at it with the plan to camp, and found a quite excellent spot that had everything you’d want for a backcountry campsite: trees for warmth and protection, flat and soft ground for ultra comfort, and a beautiful East and West view for a sweet sunset and what would be an epic sunrise. A solid camp spot to end what would arguably be our biggest day of the trip.

**Wednesday 8/11 - Lambert Lake (Oweep Creek) to Ouray Lake | 17.81 miles, 3,323ft**

With a beautiful sunrise to start the day, we both decided to wake up a bit later to both reward ourselves for the previous day’s work as well as to take in some of the sunshine before getting going. We still had camp packed up before 8am and were off to breakfast and to start the day.

The next section’s walk started with a walk to Red Knob Pass. It seemed easy and straightforward enough until I looked a bit more closely at the data this morning and realized that to get to Red Knob, we would first have to descend into a deep valley below 10,400ft at the lowest point before climbing back up to the top of the pass which sat above 12,000ft. When comparing it with the previous day’s segments it turned out that the continuous portion of the climb would be a mere 8ft shorter than the climb up to the top of Anderson Pass from the day prior.

Ultimately, all that didn’t matter because my hiking partner and I were both vibing at this point with half the trail behind us and all the confidence in the world. We made our walk around the beautiful red rock faces that overlooked Lambert Meadow and into the deep, lush valley. Once down there, we were met with a ton of sheep that seemingly came out of nowhere (or was that us?), and began scattering while also looking on from a distance. As we made our way up the long and gradual incline to the treeline we were met with what seemed to be the herding dog for the sheep. He was a big and lanky, white beast of a dog who only responded to my “good boy” chants with the biggest wagging of the tail. He seemed to enjoy our presence as he calmly circled around us and seemed to give a wave goodbye as he laid down in some shaded grass. See ya later good boy!

We continued on out of the forest and into the alpine tundra, where we made our way to the main section of the climb up Red Knob. This would be a 600ft climb up switchbacks to what looked to be any ordinary pass from the side we were on. As we made our way up, my hiking partner passed another couple making their way up as well. After a long grind I finally made it up to the top where I was met with the three others and we had a small chat.

Now, obviously we all try to deal with hygiene as best as we can when in the backcountry, but there is only so much you can do like making use of whatever lakes you come across. Deodorant was unfortunately not on the list of things to bring as it would obviously contribute to a heavier loaded backpack. That being said, my hiking partner and I were both impressing ourselves with the smells we found out we were emanating, mine of which I could only describe as onions. As we’re chatting with the couple who turned out to have just finished the Colorado Trail, took 6 days off and then started the UHT, the guy goes “Hey do you guys smell food?” with kind of an intrigued smirk on his face. I immediately start chuckling to myself before we explain to him that I smell like onions and it likely is me. He somewhat acknowledges that and then doubles down with “Yeah kind of like Italian food eh?”. I agree that I too have that covered with the 25% Italian I get from my mother’s side of the family, and we all have one final chuckle before they decide that they don’t want to be anywhere near us and begin their descent down into the valley below.

The view into this next valley unfortunately cannot be described in as much detail as it deserves because it was truly spectacular. It was almost an entire bowl of sheer mountains with the cherry on top being a glowing turquoise lake right up under our next pass. Dead Horse Lake seemed like the perfect lunch spot and we descended down Red Knob with our stomachs growling. This was another perfect example of the 10°+ sloped, 12” wide loose goat trail that I loved so much (sarcasm), but it was becoming a common occurrence at this point so we made quick work of the descent. After a long walk across the valley, a final wave to the couple we just spoke with on the previous pass as we passed them having lunch, and we were at a beautiful alpine lake that we had all to ourselves. A quick swim, a couple of hummus tacos (rehydrate hummus, spread on circular pita, fold in half, legendary), some water and we were off to what would be the steepest climb of the trip.

We’ve had some climbs on this trip as I’ve already described, but nothing was the 771ft, 1.1 mile long segment that we had in front of us. On top of that, as we got to the base of the main portion of the climb, neither of us could see where the trail actually went because the feature in front of us was a massive rockslide with the trail woven as switchbacks up through it all. This trail was just as all of the sketchy descents that I described earlier in that it was a super narrow, sloped, loose and heavily exposed trail that you basically had to maintain 3 points of contact to get up properly. Certain steps would break sections of the loose gravel free, and it wasn’t terribly confidence inspiring. We both crawled up this section together and made it up onto the narrow Dead Horse Pass in what turned out to be a much quicker time than we expected. Once it was all done and we were admiring where we'd just come from, I was certain that this pass was the best of them all for the entire trip. After staring into the beautiful cirque valley one last time we took off for our final descent of the day down toward Ledge Lake.

Earlier in the trip while climbing up Porcupine Pass, we were met with a thruhiker coming from the opposite direction. He gave us news that the Rock Creek area, the area we were thinking of camping for the night, was completely destroyed due to a fire and flooding that had come through. Noticing that the route down to Rock Creek also descends down below 10,000ft, we spotted a detour on the map that maintains the elevation you had after climbing down from Dead Horse Pass and takes you into the Jack and Jill Lakes area. We decided the night before that we would take this detour and camp for the night somewhere in the middle of it.

As we made our way onto the detour, we had around 2 miles to camp and another 2 or so to meet back up with the UHT in the morning. It became immediately apparent that the fire that occurred down in the Rock Creek region was big enough to affect the whole area, and that our small detour would be part of that burn zone. The next 2 miles were literally walking through a fresh graveyard of charred trees with the trail covered in ash and the air thick with dust. It was a sad sight to see but ultimately this is a part of our forests’ lifecycles and while we can do as much forest management as we’re funded for on an annual basis, some infernos are inevitable.

We made our way through the unique forest setting and past Jack and Jill Lakes. Finally, as the sun is going down, we settle on a beautiful piece of shoreline along Ouray Lake that was pretty windy yet covered by trees. Knowing this would keep the bugs away, we set up the tent and settled in for an unknown night in terms of the conditions. Typically when you camp next to water, your campsite can really drop in temperature at night because of heat transfer. We however had the idea that since the lake was actually pretty warm in temp, it would keep our camp warmer through the night. This idea would prove to be correct and it would also end up being the best night sleep of the trip for me.

**Thursday 8/12 - Ouray Lake to Western Terminus (Hayden Pass) | 11.84 miles, 2,185ft**

I wake up the next morning and my partner is nowhere to be found. Turns out he decided to take his sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and coffee out to the literal shore of the lake and have himself a nice breakfast. What a grand idea that must have been. As the sun is coming up the whole scene started to shine with light and come to life. This was quite possibly the most beautiful camp spot I’ve ever had officially, and fittingly it was on the last day of the trip. 

After some breakfast and quick stretching, we set on to finish the final 12 miles of the UHT. Another long 2 miles through the ever continuing burnt out forest of the Rock Creek region and we were to the other side and back onto the official trail again. The final pass that laid before us was Rocky Sea Pass, and we were not alone. Groups of backpackers started to seemingly come out of nowhere as we got closer and closer to the pass, and knowing that we were only a short distance to the trailhead this made perfect sense. As my hiking partner has made standard at this point, he jetted off to the top of the pass. I was met along the way with a guy from Salt Lake and we made small talk as we both climbed to top at a bit slower pace. As we begin to reach the top of the pass, he exclaims “Hey sweet a mountain goat!”. I assume he’s talking about my hiking partner and chuckle to myself before I look up and see this unit of a mountain goat scaling the 60°+ talus and boulder slope. He didn’t look like my hiking partner but they definitely seemed to have the same attitude as he gave us a quick look and continued bouncing up the trail-less slope.

Once to the top, we were greeted with another group of people and more groups started to fill in as we continued to hang out. After enough time my hiking partner and I decided to take off and finish our day. After dropping over 1,200ft off the pass into the valley below, we had about 8 miles left of rolling hills to finish which had a finale of a 461ft climb to the trailhead. I’ll be honest, this whole section was a blur as we punched out the final, rocky and technical miles to the finish line. This is where we started to see all walks of life: a 60+ year old husband and wife backpacking duo who were hiking the whole trail, some newer backpackers who were getting out for the first time, a couple trail running with their dog, and even a group of 5 taking their horses into the wilderness overnight. It was great to see so many people getting out into the wild, but more importantly was a reminder that we were about to be returning to civilization.

As we arrived at the trailhead, we both high fived and instantly forgot to take a picture of the western terminus sign as we wandered away. Our shuttle was due to pick us up at 2:30 and it was only 2:05. We spot an alpine lake on the other side of the road from the trailhead and agree that we will head there and clean up before our shuttle arrives. As we start to head in that direction, a lady opens the trunk of her VW Touareg and asks if we’re her group. The next thing we knew our backpacks were in the trunk of her car and we’re doing 70mph on the highway headed back to the Eastern Terminus to pick up my truck. Just like that, the trip was over.

**Other details and Thoughts**

[Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/klwt87)

*The Good*

1. I used just about every piece of gear I brought and didn’t feel like I was missing anything.
2. ZPacks Duplex is an amazing tent and worked as expected: fantastically easy to setup, easy to manage, and super lightweight compared to anything else I’ve used in the past.
3. Caltopo Pro is amazing and definitely worth the money if you’re going to be in the backcountry for more than a few days per year. This was the first trip where I tested it out and it worked flawlessly.
4. We finished within the schedule we set from the beginning which looking back on what we did was decently ambitious.
5. No injuries aside from a couple of blisters, but found out how amazing Leukotape is for blister management.

*The Bad*

1. Physical preparedness could use some improvement. I am on my way back to where I was at my peak in 2017, but being 10-15lbs from ideal weight can really make the difference on a trip like this. Not being able to keep up with my hiking partner on climbs like I used to cannot happen again, no matter the difference in our home elevations. Climbing strength will be a priority moving forward.
2. Take less food. 4,500kcal / day was too much and ultimately I had a ton of leftover food by the end of the trip that ended up weighing a significant amount. I’m glad I had enough and didn’t run out of course, but there is room for improvement. I could likely get away with 3,000kcal/day on a similar trip, and that would be at my more ideal 180lb bodyweight.
3. Bring a bag / quilt that goes below 40°F Service Temperature. My Big Agnes Pluton was barely warm enough to make sleeping bearable, but by 4am I was always waking up chilly no matter how covered I made myself. A great desert bag and ultralight at 1lb, but get a 22°F quilt next time.

*Final Thoughts*

This was an amazing trail, and for the entire 100 mile length there was not a second where I was bored. Every inch of this trail had new surprises waiting for us and it was truly a joy to wander through the loosely marked first 20 miles, then scale mountains and tundra for the final 80. As someone who works full time and only has a standard amount of vacation available, this was the perfect trip to slot into my yearly schedule and I could easily see myself doing this exact trip again with the one caveat that I summit King’s Peak along the way.

Also, the danger of climate change is real. With the entire western half of the country in constant drought conditions, we need to pay more attention to forest management and protect the wilderness around us. Not only is it a great place to enjoy and explore, but our forests are huge carbon sinks and it’s imperative that we protect them at all costs. Dealing with smoke from California on the East side of Utah for the entirety of this trip coupled with walking through a massive burn zone really lends personal perspective to the ramifications of treating our climate as an afterthought. I hope for a future of more funding for management of these areas so they can continue to exist in their current, thriving form for generations to come.",backpacking,Trip Report: Uinta Highline Trail | August 2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/p70b4g/trip_report_uinta_highline_trail_august_2021/

What essence a photo can have, anyone can hardly imagine. One photo may play various roles and cherish good or bad memories in the vein. It’s a time of happiness and difficulties, one picks that old box of albums stored down in the secret place of the room and rolls back to the times. It can hard to appreciate that perfect click that has the power to take back in time just like a time machine. That’s why to inspire people to make more memories the entire world celebrates August 19 as World Photography Day. On this day, photographers all over the world post a photo with the simple goal of sharing their photographs with the rest of the world. This act is aimed to recall unity and motivate.

When geography allows, give your neighbors plenty of room. 

I've noticed an unfortunate trend of backpackers pitching their camps immediately adjacent to mine, especially when I am away from camp bagging a peak or hiking. I find a spot well off trail in a good secluded location where there is lots of available space for neighbors at least a few hundred feet away. I go hike, and come back to find tents within 50' of my own or my group's. This is unnecessarily close. As a rule of thumb, give your neighbors as much space as possible. I'd say 200' away minimum if there is ample space in the vicinity. If for whatever reason you feel you need to pitch closer to an existing camp (especially within 100') make sure to ask whoever is already camped there.

There are many circumstances where our camps will NEED to be close together, and it is expected that you will have close neighbors. Geography and terrain and sometimes regulations mean that we are going to get close: This is totally OK and in these situations there is an understanding that we need to be tolerant and respectful of each other and out limited space. In these situations try to give people their ""bubble""; don't walk through someone's tent area if you don't have to, and be aware of how loud you are, especially at night.

The last two weekends I have come back to my camp (both times in national forests in the US) to find people camped within 50' of me for no reason. One time I moved camp (adjacent group was being very loud), the other I didn't.

In the past couple of years backpacking popularity has exploded, and more new hikers than ever are hitting the trail. We all have a right to use public lands responsibly, which includes being courteous of each other. 

PS; Do not approach a dark tent at night that is far off trail and try to pitch close by. The sleeping occupants A) don't know who you are and why you are rolling up on them in the dead of night which will cause anxiety. B) won't really appreciate waking up to find a new neighbor in their space. Obviously exceptions for through hiker camps, designated high impacted/ high traffic areas where this is the norm.

I'm wondering where can I find buildings which allow for a more social culture?

**Bad experience**: I've stayed at a condominium, where they had strict guest policies, no overnight guests, you have to ask for permission to have guests and they can only stay for a limited amount of time, and the building catered to long term residents, many of them were focused on ""quiet, security cams, ...etc.""

**Good experience(but not repeatable)**: I've stayed at Youth Hostel and was able to meet many people my age. Chill with them and had no issues. However, they told me there's a limit of 21 days to be able to stay. Once you reach the limit you can't stay.

**My ideal building:** I only want a small studio apartment, with no guests rules and where my guests can stay for extended periods of time(say a week or two). It'll also be cool to live nearby a bar or small restaurant. Bonus if other young people live nearby, though not a requirement. Hoping to avoid older folks, families and retirees.

**Still learning about:** Co-living spaces and Hotel residencies. But don't know what the rules will be.

Wow, these vaccines are amazing. I think everyone should go out and get that Yellow Fever Vaccine now. Its imperative!   
You know I dont want to get Yellow Fever from some of these damn non vaccinated people. (what?! Its from Mosquitoes!?) Oh' right, but I am safe, I got the Yellow Fever Vaccine.

Goodness gracious! Let me tell you about the time that the Yellow Fever vaccine saved my life. (I still dont know if I have ever been exposed to Yellow Fever or even been to an area with it... but you know I am ready!)

When you get your yellow Fever Vaccine they give you a little yellow “vaccine passport” booklet.  
This little booklet had lived in my sweaty, stinky money belt for years, going from country to country, hoping, dreaming of the day when it would perform its “special purpose”.

It wasnt the first time I had crossed that tropical border into Cambodia but what made this time special was there was a small, crudely built booth where the uniformed guards had placed a sign, mentioning the yellow fever vaccine requirement.

I was so very excited, I felt like Steve Martin in “the Jerk”, finally, my Vaccine booklet's special purpose would be recognized!

I eagerly dug out my yellow vaccine booklet to display to the guards, but they acted like they had actually never seen one before and had no use for it. They wanted 2$ whether I had the unlikely booklet or not. Ah' I was so deflated. They were collecting 2$ from every foreign traveler.  
So in my naivety, I thought, so then we would get the vaccine nearby or that the vaccine would matter? No, not there, and not to them. Its a scam, a sham and just another excuse to fleece travelers.

Not saying that the vaccine wont help you with Yellow Fever, hey, in fact, you should rush out now and get it, it may save your life, but it wont save you 2$. It also wont prevent you from entering Cambodia or many other countries with “soft borders”.",backpacking,Cambodian Border and Vaccines,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/p5979c/cambodian_border_and_vaccines/

When i am moving across Europe (visiting the following cities: Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest), are we able to move between the countries freely despite being from the UK if that makes sense provided the countries are accepting tourists? Or do we have to stop at the borders and have paperwork checked/ issued? 

Also, if a country moves to the red list in the UK, would I have to quarrantine on return if I got out of the country into another one ( say Germany to Czecslovakia) and continued my trip then returned to UK two weeks later or would i be okay if I could prove that I left that country before the red list deadline!?

I'm planning to go to Belgium, France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Germany.

While on our 4.5 day, 85 mile trek through the Bob Marshall Wilderness last week, Dovah managed to put a 3"" hole into my Thermarest Uberlite pad (I was using a thicccc sleeping pad liner in conjuction...) right as we were going to bed on our last night. So I slept on the ground with Dovah, and then we boogied up White River Pass and up to Benchmark Trailhead in the morning.

Sleeping on the ground sucked. And I need a new pad. My wife's Sea To Summit self-inflating pad has served her well, and definitely stood up to our dogs paws. Thing is, I hate the size of it, and when I've borrowed it before, I struggle to get the thing to fit into the bag.

**Shimla** is known for its lush green valleys and amicable air around the city.

I visited Shimla during April end. The temperature was neither too hot nor cold at that time.

I started from Chandigarh and reached Shimla by cab. It was repugnant as all the roads were under construction due to which all greenery is vanishing on the way.

I booked an apartment through AIRBNB. It was somewhat far from the main city but the stay was enjoyable.

There are limited options to explore in Shimla.

I visited Mall Road, The Ridge, Lower Bazaar, Tibetan Market, Lakkar Bazaar and Jakhoo Temple.

It is advisable not to carry anything while visiting the Jakhoo temple as there are a lot of monkeys ready to play with you there.

One can enjoy delish street food in Lower &amp; Lakkar Bazaar.

Around Shimla, one can explore nature and its beauty.

River Rafting in river Satluj ( Chaba, Shimla ) was a delightful escapade.

One can also enjoy horse riding in the hills of Naldhera.

I visited Hatu peak, Narkanda and the view was magnificent. It is located at an elevation of 11,152 ft above sea level.

At last, grabbed the toy train from Shimla to Kalka. The Kalka-Shimla Railway line comes under UNESCO world heritage site.

I would personally advise avoiding the busy seasons of June-July and December-January.

If you are planning a holiday with family, it might be difficult if you have still studying kids. But if you are going with your friends you can select any date. As you are asking for an only a 4-day trip, you can also figure out your kids leave from their institutes. Choose days of weekends and dates where they have no exam around.

In Himachal, summers don’t last that much. The hotter months are June-July and half May and August.

You can pick Feb-March or September-November for your trip.

Now come on to the places to visit. As the trip is only for 4-days, I would suggest traveling only famous places. Don’t go for unseen destinations there.

Also, visit places which are more nearer to each other so you can explore more in a little time.

It’s impossible to see all the famous places in Himachal in just 4-days. But still, if you have only that much time, you should better choose wisely.

Here are some places according to your potential interest:-

* If you are keen on watching the snow and exploring snow activities then Shimla would be the best for you. Shimla is a very beautiful city. Also took your 4-days completely to explore it and it will be worth visiting there. There’s a lot to see there. Kuffri, Jakhu Mandir, Narkande, Advanced study, Mall road, Christ church, Lakad Bazar, Chail, Narkanda, etc.
* You can visit Kullu-Manali and both together in only 2–3 days. Places to visit in Kullu-Manali are Rohtang Pass(will get snow there too), Solang valley, Hadimba mandir, Vashist hot-water spring, Tibetan monasteries, Gulaba, etc.
* You can plan to visit all three places together on your 4-days trip. That would be a perfect trip. Also it takes 4–5 hours to reach from Kullu-Manali to Shimla.
* Other places you can visit are- Dharamsala and Kangra. Places to visit in Dharamsala are Tsuglagkhang Complex, Namgyal Monastery, Kareri Dal Lake, Bhagsunag Temple, Mcleod ganj, etc. In Kangra are Jawalamukhi Temple, Chamunda and Baijnath Mandir, Kangra Fort, Kangra art gallery, etc.

There’s plenty more places to visit. But as per your limited holidays, that would be sufficient and worth it.

Remember these are not only places to visit in himachal and nor you can completely explore all of them in 4-days. But hey, you are not coming first and last time to himachal.

Visit again if you’ll have a good experience which I’m sure you’ll.

Just went backpacking for the first time this past weekend with 2 friends (had an amazing time!!). One of them set up a gravity filter at camp using what came in the Sawyer Squeeze box. I immediately saw the convenience of the grav system, and wanted to make my own. Already having a Sawyer Squeeze, I went out and got a Platypus 2L bottle (as I've read many people say the squeeze bags suck and don't last). I tried recreating the grav system in my backyard, but I can't get it to work. From top to bottom, the parts are:

1. Platypus 2L water bottle hung upside down from tree in mesh bag
2. Blue cap (from Sawyer squeeze box)
3. Gray tube (from sawyer squeeze box)
4. Gray adapter (from sawyer squeeze box)
5. Sawyer Squeeze with flip cap

The connection between the Platypus bottle and blue cap keeps leaking and dribbling water out. If I replace the Platypus bag with the original Sawyer bag, the system works fine with no leaks. Is my Platypus bottle defective (it does not leak with the provided cap)? Or are the Platypus bottle and sawyer cap not compatible? I thought it was a universal thread fit?

1. A out and back type trail
2. A point to point (Loop) type trail
3. A point to point (Non-Loop) type trail

I would think that a out and back type trail might be easier for a beginner since a beginners sense of direction and navigational skills might be non-existent and mediocre at best. Therefore having to go back the way you came would be easiest, since a beginner can use 'landmarks' or 'points of interest' as easy waypoints. Not having to go thru a new section of trail would therefore lessen some anxiety and make the trip home a whole lot easier. 

Also, How long of a trip should a beginner first start with? 

2 days - 1 night seems a little short and not enough time to thoroughly test gear, skills and knowledge of backcountry camping. It also seems like a pretty short time for enjoying yourself out in nature. Might as well just camp out in your own backyard if its only for just 1 night. 

Does 2 days - 2 nights sound like a good length for a beginner backpacker? What trip lengths timewise do beginners usually start with? What does that usually equate to in miles hiked each day? I guess that will depend on the specific trail you are planning to do, your fitness level, as well as your own judgement as to how much and what kind of mileage (small vs big elevation gains) you are willing to do.",backpacking,Beginner Backpacking Trip Concerns...???,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/ozicsd/beginner_backpacking_trip_concerns/

**1 nights: Korcula.** Relax and enjoy the island

Ferry to Hvar

**2 nights: Hvar.** Check out and enjoy more island life. 

Ferry to Split

**1 nights: Split.** Checking out the Diocletian architecture it's famed for. One full day to explore the city.

**1 nights: Munich.** Relax for the night in Munich before flying back to the states the next day.

2. I have been thinking about renting a car, but am not sure about driving there as an American. Is it difficult to read the road signs or is driving generally safe and easy there?
3. Food, wine, cheese recommendations are always always welcome! Also interested in cafe culture or coffee in general.

I love backpacking and hiking in general and don't want my fears to stop me but after two negative experiences and hearing so many horror stories I am so scared.
The first time it happened was last September, I was with my partner and we were the only ones at our backcountry site. As we were falling asleep we heard a few noises but didn't think nothing of it, well I woke up in the middle of the night to scratching, grunting, heavy breathing. I didn't want to wake up my partner cause I was scared that he would start talking or roll over and draw attention to us in the tent. Both of us had bear spray but I didn't know what to do in the middle of the night to scare it away since it's dark and we didn't have a car or anything to get to quickly. I ended up not sleeping the entire night and just staying so still so it couldn't hear us. Woke up in the morning to claw marks in the dirt around our tent and muddy black bear paw prints around the bear lockers (we had no scented things in our tent that night, put literally everything unnecessary, including our full packs into the lockers).
The second time was just a few weeks ago (my first backpacking trip of the summer) and this time we were in a busier area and there were 2 other couples at the backcountry site (6 of us in total, in 3 tents). Woke up again to a black bear in camp. We kinda yelled at the other tent to see if theyre awake and they heard it and they did. We all got our bear spray ready and started yelling to try and scare it away and nothing was working. It hung around our campsite for probably 3 or 4 hours.  Didn't show any agressive behaviour but just nothing would startle it. Ended up checking out each of our tents and hanging in the area and eventually wandered off.
I used to think I was prepared and I would know what to do in a situation involving bears but after these two encounters I am so scared and had no clue what else to do to try and get it to go away. (Both times were in a national park so bear bangers are illegal). The place that we are heading to in a few days apparently has a high grizzly bear activity warning. I am so scared but I don't want these experiences to ruin my outlook of backpacking and outdoor recreation in general.

I went backpacking for the very first time a couple of years ago with two experienced backpackers and fell in love with it. This will be the first time i'm the one taking someone for their first time. 

I'm slightly nervous of encountering a bear, since last time I went one of the people I was with was carrying a gun which put my nerves at ease. I don't currently own a gun, nor would I bring one if I had one. I do plan on bringing bear spray in the case that I would encounter a bear. I'm also bringing my dog, but am nervous that she'll startle a bear if we see one. I know the basic precautions like, don't leave any food out, hang up all equipment 10+ feet up in a tree, don't startle a bear, and don't get in between a sow and her cubs.

How do I get over this anxiety? The first time I went was extremely enjoyable since I was in good hands. The spot i'm going to is by no means a hard trek, it's pretty moderate. It's an 8.5 mile hike into desolation.

Hey all - let's talk #2... I've backpacked with enough folks to know this is not an uncommon issue and it's been the worst part of my last couple of trips so looking for tips.  I'm pretty regular at home so not an issue I deal with off trail.  On the trail usually a lot of stomach churn after eating (whether meals or snacks), feeling of urgency to go fairly often but inability to have real 'success' when I go the trouble to dig a hole and try, and just general bloaty discomfort.  It sucks.  Can back up from from 48-96 hours which is often most/all of a trip.  Usually goes right back to normal within a day following a trip.  


Things I assume contribute in some form:  
1. Eating processed garbage on trail that I don't normally eat (carby snacks, dehydrated meals, etc).  
2. Not drinking coffee on trail when I am a regular drinker at home  
3. Not hydrating consistently enough throughout the day (I drink plenty but probably not as well aligned to expenditure - I tend to try to 'camel' water by drinking lots at stops with electrolytes to avoid heavy water carries).

We've been live for a few months but already have over 600 itineraries that folks have posted. The idea came to me about two years ago on a trip to Italy with my wife where I had not done any research ahead of the trip (she had done all of it and was upset with me), but redeemed myself a bit when I got a few itineraries from colleagues who had taken similar trips before.

So I thought it would be extremely useful for the world to have a free platform where all itineraries could be shared. That's how it was born. On the platform, you're able to search and filter for itineraries based on destination, month, length of stay, cost and trip type for the perfect trip. By trip type, I mean using tags like #nationalparks or #hiking.

Some other features include:

* ability to build a travel profile of all locations you've been to and a visual map with pins that you could share with friends/family.
* save, react to, and give kudos to other itineraries
* social feed to connect with like-minded travelers, ask questions, form groups and get advice - message and follow users too.
* fun community experience with points, coins, badges, rewards, reputation scores

To encourage folks to post their itineraries, for now, we are giving away Amazon gift cards for each itinerary that's shared.

Firstly, I wanted to share here because hopefully it's of interest to folks planning their trips.

Itinsy.com

Secondly, very open to feedback and ways we can improve / other features you would like to see. Feel free to email me directly ([alex@itinsy.com](mailto:alex@itinsy.com)) or share your feedback below.

Does anyone have any experience with the Paria Arches 2?

I am looking to get a lightweight packable budget trekking pole tent. I was planning on getting the Lanshan 2 but then I came across the Paria Arches 2. I have a Paria sleeping pad and I love it. I have also dealt with their customer service and they were great. 

The Arches is a little bigger (but also heavier) than the Lanshan and I would probably be using it with my kids (1 at a time) every once in a while so that little bit of space could be helpful. But I haven’t been able to find much on the durability or reliability of the tent. Does it handle the weather as well as the Lanshan?

I have seen that the lines and stake out points need to be modified, but I don’t really mind that. Also, the extra weight seems reasonable for the larger size I would be getting. 

I’m just wondering if I could get some feedback from someone who has used one and if I should just go with the tried and true Lanshan 2?

And if you have any other lightweight sub $200 2P trekking pole tents, I’d love to hear about them! Thanks!",backpacking,Paria Arches 2 or Lanshan 2?,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/oujwt5/paria_arches_2_or_lanshan_2/

As the post title suggests, I am 24 years old and have just quit my job.  I’m a business graduate and have been working in sales and marketing for 3 years.  Over the course of the last year or so, I have become so disinterested with corporate life and the career ladder.   It got to the point where every morning when I woke up I was dreading the day ahead.  The drive to work in the morning filled me with absolute misery as I prepared to sacrifice more of my time to a job I do not enjoy.  I would find myself counting the clock waiting for 5pm and freedom everyday.  Then I get a few hours of freedom before it’s time for bed and a repeat of this cycle until 5pm Friday where I get to enjoy my own time for 2 days until the cycle starts again Monday morning.

I decided last week that this is no way to live.  I decided to put myself first and quit my job.  I did it amicably and offered to work my notice period out of respect for the opportunity I’d been given but I just couldn’t continue working in a job that doesn’t fulfil me.  While I am a bit nervous at the thought of taking a hiatus from working life while all my peers progress through their respective career paths, I feel I’ve made the right decision.  The big question that is looming over me now is, what next?

Well I think I have made my decision.  I am planning on going travelling.  I’ve always been a keen traveller and have done 3 extended trips longer than 3 months (two to the US in 2016 &amp; 2017 and one to Southeast Asia in 2018) and they have been the happiest times of my life.  I want to recapture that feeling of fulfilment that I get from experiencing the world.

I have always had my eye on a huge trip potentially followed by going to Australia for a couple of years on a working holiday Visa.  If it weren’t for COVID and the travel lockdowns I would have went travelling last year but obviously that wasn’t possible so I’ve been saving up over that time as I knew it might be something I would like to do eventually.

The only difference between now and the previous times I’ve been travelling is that I met a girl during lockdown and we’ve been together almost a year now, but she is game to leave her job and do it with me.  And I want her too as well which is a big plus!

So yeah.  I just wanted to hear any input or advice from people who have maybe done something similar in their twenties or are thinking about it.

I’m planning on documenting my travels too.  I am quite a keen amateur photographer.  I’m on Instagram under transientearth if you want to see any of my travelling pictures.  I also wanted to ask if anyone has any tips for good equipment to take travelling such as drones, good cameras, GoPro’s etc.

It was my first backpacking trip, and it was incredible! I wanted to ask for recommendations from this community for my next backpacking trip. 

Here’s what I liked about the Cirque of the Towers as someone who’s new to backpacking:

1) It was a loop- so arranging drop off and pickup was easy- I just parked the rental car at the trailhead!

2) It was ~30 miles, so it was something I could do in a few day (outside of the time it took me to travel to Wyoming from Florida). It’s hard to leave family for any more than a week.

3) It was in the US, so travel was relatively quick, convenient, and cheap.

4) It was easy to find water with all of the streams and lakes.

5) There was a lot of variety in terms of topography and vegetation on the hike.

This season, I finally got myself a dehydrator and vacuum sealer and have been thinking more about trail food options. 

It strikes me that when you look up dehydrated backpacking recipes / techniques, there's no distinction between what's safe / appropriate for short-term-prepped (e.g. up to two weeks in advance) meals for a shorter trip (a week or less) and those prepped 3+ weeks or months in advance to be sent through the mail to drop points for long-distance trail users.

I find myself making meals that can be shelf stable for a year even though I only need them to last the weekend - and that I'm making sacrifices to taste / nutrition that maybe I don't need to be making. For example, I recently saw a recipe where someone just dehydrated raw eggs, cheese, and fried hash-browns  and my mind jumped to: but the fats! The dairy! The egg! How can this be alright? When really, I could probably even be fine taking non-dehydrated cheese for three days without it really being an issue.

I know some people are more of the ""what doesn't kill you makes your stronger"" / ""refrigeration is for wimps"" type. I fall somewhere on the spectrum in  between this and the ""any un-refridgerated food left out for more than two hours is poison"" type. I'm not interested in gambling ruining my trips with food poisoning to prove how tough I am, but also don't want to be making meal sacrifices that really don't need to be made.

I'm interested in your thoughts, experience, tips, techniques, resources on this. Some specific areas of concern for me:

- Dehydrated meat that isn't preservative-soaked

- Fats, oils (Does the fat in foods go rancid faster than the small container of olive oil I'm bringing with me to add in on the trail? Is separating them only a thing that's necessary if, for example, you're mailing yourself food on the trail and buying fresh oil periodically as you go?)

- Dairy (cheese, yogurt, creamy sauces)

- Storage of dehydrated meals (Is the freezer necessary if it's only for a week?)

- Degree of dehydration (Do foods have a better taste / texture if not dehydrated down to lowest possible humidity? Is there a balance between how dry you make something and how long you'd be comfortable storing it at room temp or in a warm summer pack?)

5,000 years of civilization, a great wall of wonders, tales of legendary dragons, fluffy pandas and global economic dominance. You can find all of this and much more in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Keep reading to learn more about China facts and secrets.

***Wave The Flag***

The Chinese flag has a red background with five golden stars in the upper left corner. Red stands for the blood of the Chinese and it’s also the main color of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); often worn at weddings and festivals for good luck. The large star is for the Chinese communist party, the smaller stars represent the different groups in the country.

All the five stars united together to defeat [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/) in WWII. “Zeng Liansong” designed the current flag when the communist government started a new flag designing competition in 1949. He said he was inspired by the Soviet flag.

***Sing Along***

The national anthem of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is called “The March of the Volunteers”. In 1935, the anthem was written by “Tian Han” and composed by “Nie Er” who both took part in the resistance to the Japanese invasion. It was written in the Vernacular –the public language- rather than the classical Chinese to reach a larger audience and encourage the Chinese people to resist the Japanese invaders.

***Pin on the Map***

China lies in south-east Asia facing the Pacific Ocean, [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)shares borders with 14 countries; the summit of Mount Everest of the Himalayas is a border-line between China and Nepal.

The summit of Mount Everest is a boarder-line between [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and Nepal

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is the 4th largest country in the world and the second-biggest nation in Asia after Russia.

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)has over 1.500 flowing rivers; the main rivers are the Yellow River in the north and the Yangtze River in the south. Both rivers originate from the Tibetan plateau.

***Flora and Fauna***

The pure water of China’s rivers has a great impact on the diversity of the Chinese wildlife with over 30,000 plant species such as [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)Fir, Yunnan Cypress, The happy tree and Bamboo.

The Chinese used the native plants in cooking, medical potions and offerings to God as Buddhists believe that those plants are holy. The plants provide home and food for over 4,400 animal species such as pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, Chinese pheasant and Bactrian camel.

***Look at the History Book***

***The First Dynasty***

Thousands of years ago, the yellow river flooded every year and destroyed crops of rice and silk. That changed when an engineer, called “Yu”, spent 13 years digging canals and waterways that redirected the floods into new fields. “Yu” saved the farmers’ lives, so he was named king and his family started the very first Dynasty of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/): The “Xia” Dynasty.

***The First United Chinese Empire*** All the following dynasties were small, separated by rivers, and rapidly fell apart. By 221 BCE, “Qin Shi Huang” became the first emperor to unite most of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)under the rule of the “Qin” Dynasty. He set laws and had a governmental system of ministries. The Qin Empire is pronounced “CH-in”. This unified empire gave birth to today’s “CH-IN-A”.

***The Story Behind The Wall*** Emperor “Qin” saw the Pacific Ocean and the Tibetan plateau as natural defenses. He started building a barrier against the Turkish, the Mongols and the Xiongnu in the north. He called it the long wall.

In the 13th century, the Mongols breached the long wall under the leadership of “Genghis Khan”. In 1368, “Zhu Yuan Zhang” defeated the Mongols and took over [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)again starting the “Ming” Dynasty. He continued building the wall. Watchtowers started to use fire and smoke signals in case of raiders.

The great wall came into use in WWII. China used the Wall to stop the Japanese from going north.

***Modern Era*** From 1927 to 1949, a civil war erupted in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). The communist party won the war. On October 1st, 1949, the first communist leader “Mao Zedong” declared the People’s Republic of China: the current political status in China. Today, October 1st is the national day of China.

“Mao Zedong” is the man on the “Chinese yuan”; the official currency of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); one yuan equals 0.15 US dollars.

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)hosted the 2008 summer Olympics &amp; Paralympics in the capital Beijing. The spectacular opening ceremony had 2,008 drummers played the bronze Fou drums singing: “Isn’t it delightful to have friends coming from afar?” which is a poem by the Chinese philosopher “Confucius”.

***Take A Walk***

***Beijing*** It’s the capital and the most visited city in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Beijing is the meeting point of ancient culture and modern Chinese arts.

***The Great Wall of China*** It’s one of the biggest man-made structures on earth with 21,196 Km in length. The highest place in the wall reaches 14 meters.

As a UNESCO world heritage site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World, you can’t miss having a photograph next to history; it’s a breathtaking experience to watch the sunrise from the wall as the sun casts light on the beautiful nature. Just head to the Badaling Pass north of Beijing as organized tours and public transports are available for you.

***The Forbidden City or The Imperial Palace*** In the heart of Beijing, This UNESCO world heritage palace was home to emperors of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

It covers 720,000 square kilometers and is guarded by a 10-meter wall.

Emperor “Chengzu” of the Ming Dynasty built the palace with 9,999 rooms; He said that only the God of heaven can have 10,000 rooms!

The once forbidden to the public is now an open museum with over 50,000 Chinese art pieces for you to enjoy along with the 3 main halls in the palace; the Hall of Preserving Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony and the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

***Beijing Zoo &amp; Aquarium***

It’s time to meet new friends only found in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Your first destination would be The Panda Hall as it’s hard to find pandas at any other zoo around the Globe. Not restricted to native Chinese animals; The Beijing zoo has over 5,000 different animals from all around the world like the American Bison and the Australian Kangaroo. Tickets are free if you’re under 1.2 meters tall, you can even rent a sightseeing car around the zoo for a little extra money.

Now let’s stop by the largest artificial aquarium in the world, you can spot all kinds of marine life like man-eating fish, Chinese sturgeons, sea elephants and even scary sharks.

Enjoy shows performed by dolphins, sea lions &amp; whales in the aquarium theatre.

***Beijing 798 Art Zone*** It’s an open gallery of street arts, hip sculptures, and unusual yet exciting artwork.

This place was a compound of military factories that made destructive weapons in WWII. Now it’s a home for promising young Chinese artists whose crafts can revive the mind and soul.

***The Terracotta Army*** In 1970 in Xi’an city, an underground discovery of 8,000 statues of man-sized warriors, 520 horses, and 100 chariots were found guarding the tomb of “Qin Shi Huang” the first emperor of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Scientists say those clay statues were made around 248 BCE. It’s a mesmerizing UNESCO world heritage site.

***The Chinese Pyramids*** Emperor’s “Qin” tomb isn’t the only burial place in Xi’an city. The city was considered sacred to the ancient Chinese. They called it “eternal peace” and built several Pyramids in Xi’an to house the emperors’ bodies in their journey to eternal peace. The Chinese Pyramids pretty much resemble the Egyptian Pyramids in keeping the bodies safe for the afterlife. So, you don’t have to visit [Egypt](https://globitopia.com/egypt-facts/) to see a Pyramid!

***The Three Gorges of the Yangtze River*** It’s the biggest hydroelectric power-producing dam in the world. The former president “Sun Yat-sen” in 1919 thought of building a power source on the Yangtze. However, the project was opened in 2003!

The best way to the gorges is by a relaxing Yangtze River cruise. On reaching the three gorges, you’ll find available buses, escalators, and guides to take you around one of the greatest engineering buildings ever made.

***Leshan Giant Buddha / Mount Emei*** A 71-meter tall statue was carved in the stones of Mount Emei by orders of the Buddhist monk “Hai Tong” who was worried about the safety of the poor fishermen whose boats crashed due to the turbulence of the three rivers: Min, Qingyi, and Dadu Rivers.

The statue was built overlooking the meeting point of the three rivers to watch over the water and keep the people safe. The Leshan Buddha is the largest Buddha sculpture in the world.

With many Buddhist temples in the mountain, Mount Emei is considered a Buddhist holy site and a UNESCO world heritage site.

Plan on visiting the temples around and enjoy the landscape of the Qingying Pavilion, or start a hiking trip to the golden summit of the mountain. If your feet hurt, you can take cable cars on your way up.

***Zhangjiajie Forest National Park – Hunan*** In 2009, The movie director James Cameron shot his record-breaking “Avatar” in the Hallelujah mountains of the Zhangjiajie Forest. Since then, People call the famous site the “Avatar mountains”.

the Hallelujah mountain of the Zhangjiajie Forest

The park is a jaw-dropping greenery place with beautiful lakes, a huge dam, and a Chinese ethnic tribe with unusual traditions. For example, the bride must cry for 3 days before her wedding, the longer she cries the more beautiful of a wife she gets.

***Shanghai Markets*** It’s about time to go shopping. In Shanghai, there’s a market for everything and everyone with a very reasonable price.

It’s a wonderful day for treasure hunting in the “City God Temple Market” which is full of Chinese antiques like the Chinese teapot and cups which are called the Gaiwan. It’s the perfect place for souvenirs and gifts.

Do you want to look fabulous for much less money? The “Qipu Road Clothing Market” is the place for you with good deals on the latest fashion trends.

Looking for some quality fabrics or a fully customized suit made especially for you? Pay the “Bund Fabric Market” a visit, don’t forget to haggle; you can save half of the asked price.

***Meet The People***

China has the highest population in the world with 1.4 billion people. However, China is a major economic powerhouse. [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/) has a constant improvement in the employment structure despite the huge number of people living there. New jobs are popping every day as a result of the evolving economy. In 2015, China announced that it has more than 526 different jobs with nearly none underemployed.

There’s an old saying referring to [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/): “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes up, he will shake the world.” We guess this prophecy came true with the Chinese economy.

There are 302 different languages in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); the most common is the standard Chinese also known as “Mandarin”. Other languages are found only in particular territories like the “Wu” which is spoken only in Shanghai.

***Mark Your Calendar***

The Chinese New Year or The Lunar New Year usually starts between January 21 and February 20.

For this holiday, The Chinese decorate the streets with red lanterns and ribbons. Kids are given money in red envelopes. Feasts and celebrations last for 15 days. The lunar New Year is marked by a dragon dance and a huge parade. The legend says that around every new lunar year, a vicious dragon attacked the villagers but the ancestors used the red decorations to scare the beast away.

The Chinese usually wear traditional clothes at their festivals such as the “Tang Suit” for men and the “Qipao” for women.

The “Guoyue” music is often played at festivals and around markets. It’s the national music in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); it’s easy for your ears to recognize the Chinese music with the high pitched notes and the stringy instruments like the Guzheng, the Pipa and the Yangqin.

***Take a bite***

Bring your chopsticks and join our feast of Chinese food, It’s heart-whelming to the exten that it’s now eaten in every country all around the world.

Could you please set your fork and knife aside for now? The knife and fork stand for violence and fights in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/), unlike the chopsticks that stand for gentleness and passion.

***Noodles*** A worldwide famous Chinese dish. Noodles are starchy dough that’s shaped into spiral strings. Archaeologists found a 4,000-year-old bowl of noodles reserved underground in the Lajia archaeological site. There’s also an ancient book that described the Han Dynasty and mentioned the Noodles dish.

***Dim Sum*** Small bite-sized squishy stuffed dough with meat, or veggies. It can be fried, steamed or dropped in broth. It’s believed that Dim Sums go back to 2,500 years ago; as the ancestors glorified them in an ancient Chinese poem.

***Spring Rolls*** A traditional Chinese snack of pastry filled with cabbage, shredded veggies and sometimes you can add pork or meat.

Spring Rolls go back to the Jin Dynasty as the ancestors ate them at the beginning of the spring, and called them the “dish of Spring”.

***Tofu*** It’s believed that Prince “*Liú Ān*” of the Han Dynasty invented Tofu to help feed his toothless grandmother.

Another story goes with a cook who accidentally applied the cheese-making methods to soy milk. Anyway, it’s a delicious nutritious soybean curd that’s so easy to devour.

***Fun Fact***

***Dance On Water*** The young dancer “Yang Liu” has practiced the Chinese “Duzhu Drifting” since she was 7 years old to keep the tradition alive. She performs the Chinese dance on a floating bamboo stick with the whole river as her stage. This tradition started thousands of years ago in the Chishui River as a method for transporting wood to the capital by water. The Duzhu Drifting requires skill, flexibility, practice, and balance.

Anywho, the hostel and shelter will be on opposite ends of the lot with a garden in the middle

The property is surrounded by a wall, my goal was to make the rooms just for napping and to focus the budget on the shared common areas so people spend more time there rather than the room, i was not going to put windows in the rooms but as soon as you leave the room the patio doors will be all glass so plenty of light coming through

My architect said that it might have a sense of a jail if i wanted it this way, there will be ventiliation for the rooms and perhaps windows for airflow but no view because of the walls, i could make the rooms more appealing but i wanted more grassy land for both the humans and animals

Aside from the lack of windows, the room will have ceiling fan, ductless air con, japanese style capsule beds with a light, electrical socket, shelf, locker and privacy curtain, i dont plan to have a desk or chairs in the room",backpacking,"Hostel travelers, can you share your thoughts on room designs for new hostel?",https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/onnmiz/hostel_travelers_can_you_share_your_thoughts_on/

I took it on several day hikes with like 10 to 12 pounds in it to help break it in and it did just fine. However when I took it out 5 days ago on its first backpacking trip with a 21 pound total weight, it was doing nothing but digging into my shoulders right next to my neck and not riding in my hips at all regardless of how tight or loose the hip belt or shoulder straps were. I always pack my bags the same way with my lightweight and down on the bottom and evenly placing heavier things as I fill the pack to make sure it's not lopsided.

Changing how I pack the bag
Tightening the hip belt
Loosening the hip belt
Tightening the shoulder straps
Loosening the shoulder straps
Placing the shoulder straps on a different part of my shoulder (made it worse if anything)

I'm 100% positive I measured correctly because I had 3 separate people measure me using the guide on their website and I was in the middle of the large category so I don't think sizing is the issue. 

I'm not by any means new to backpacking and have used other packs in the past with heavier weight than what I used out there and didn't have this happen with them.

[Minikeg – Kifaru International](https://kifaru.net/store/packs/day-packs/minikeg/)

After owning many packs (Gorucks, TAD, Osprey, Mystery Ranch etc) this is my unicorn.

For those of you that dont know, Kifaru are a US based cottage manufacturer who also make their packs in the USA from top line products (Xpac, 500 denier nylon, ITW, YKK etc). Their core packs are external frame packs with a wilderness hunting and load hauling focus, with durability and **heavy** load hauling (we're talking elk and bear carcasses and loads of 100kg+).

So as a general rule, not the sort of thing we go for around these parts.

Their packs are rightly famous for durability, load hauling ability, comfort and quality. However they are also equally infamous for their high cost, with an external frame + pack + extras combo looking to push you close to the 1,000 USD mark.

The pack in question here however is an outlier for Kifaru - its the Minikeg, a relatively lightweight and *internal* framed backpack specifically designed to be carry on compatible with dimensions pretty much spot on the 22 x 14 x 9 mark. Cost is high at 370 USD, but not in the crazy high realm of their framed packs, and on par with peers like TAD, Mystery Ranch, Goruck etc.

First - the Pics:

[Kifaru Minikeg - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/geuu9wZ)

From the manufacturer:

**MINIKEG SPECS / FEATURES**  
– **Weight:** 2.85 lbs / 1.3 kg w/ Long SS, no belt  
– **Weight:** 3.39 lbs / 1.5 kg w/ long shoulder straps and medium WB (using roll top lid)  
– **Fabric:** 500d DWR coated Cordura / Xpac  
– **Total capacity:** 2800 ci / 45.8 L  
– Capacity with snow collar as lid: 2300 ci / 37.7 L  
– Main compartment dimensions: 11.5″ / 29cm wide x 9″ / 23cm depth x 29″ / 73.5cm height (22"" /55cms with snow collar as lid)  
– Opening circumference: 37.5″ / 95cm  
– Internal water bladder sleeve with hang tab and dual hose ports  
– Chamber pocket  
– Duplex shoulder straps and waistbelt for superior load carry performance. (Included)  
– 22″ Composite or aluminum stays  
– Dual external water bottle pockets with three way stretch fabric and side compression straps  
– Bottom compression straps  
– Grab handles on the top and bottom of the pack

**Carry on capability (size)**

I've included pictures above of the measurements. Generally they're pretty accurate; with the snow collar folded down you're looking at a pack that measures a whisker over 22"" (but could easily be compressed into any spacer as the stays themselves are 22 inches and flexible to boot) and less than 14"" wide (closer to 12""). The only problem with size is the depth, with the main bag itself being 9"" (so fine) but the suspension system has a massive tensioned lumbar pad over an inch thick that adds to this, plus the hip-belt is pretty clunky as well.

That said, it should fit in an overhead or spacer just fine as long as it is not overstuffed, but I would definitely take off the hip-belt to make sure, and to lower the profile of the pack so you dont stick out.

**Carry on capability (weight)**

The pack (as I have it set up) is listed at 1.5kgs (mine weighed in at 1.7kgs stock) so for a pack of this size and with the sort of durability and construction this thing has, that's actually pretty good. Its no UL pack for you dyneema obsessed gram counters, but it's no slouch either, and the comfort and durability leave UL packs dead in the water. 

I've always been of the view that I am prepared to pay an extra 0.5 - 1kgs for something that wont fall apart on me in the back-country, and is a dream to carry.

However, note when you start adding extras (as I have) the weight increases.

On my pack I added the Sherman pocket (an external shove it pocket that both functions as a beaver tail, and a quick grab pocket and adds 8L + stuff it capacity to the overall bag. I also added 3 belt pouches (a small, a mini and a roll up dump pouch from Helikon Tex to function as a water bottle holder on the belt), a Helikon Tex removable framesheet containing a sea to summit tablet sleeve, and some shock cord for a bungee system, plus an ITW Nexus carabiner and webbing keepers, and the 2 spare webbing straps you need to carry if you want to run this thing without a hip-belt (to look a little less conspicuous boarding aircraft for example).

This all pushed the total weight to 2.7kgs (2.3kgs with the frame sheet and laptop sleeve removed and inserted in my personal item Helikon Tex EDC Light daypack).

That sounds a lot, but bear in mind the main pack expands out to 45.8L, the side water bottle holders each easily hold 2 x 1L bottles, the Sherman pocket holds an extra 8L, the belt pouches hold another 2-3L and the stuff it area easily holds another 10L or so. In addition the pack can easily accommodate more stuff via external lashing all over it, via the bungee cord on the top, and the side and bottom compression straps (a tent, sleeping mat, rain jacket, tarp etc).

Without even using the bottom and side compression straps, and the bungee cord, you could max this thing out at 70L or so easy, which is more than enough for a multi week through hike if you have some idea of what you're doing.

I've yet to trim down some of the excess webbing straps, and that should shave off a few hundred grams as well.

**Overall thoughts**

This thing is crazy comfortable and crazy durable (on par with Mystery Ranch's high end packs), and the materials are bomproof and spot on with decent weather resistance from the Xpac components (but by no means waterproof), it's super well made, and has been a pleasure to haul weights of up to 15kgs (35lbs) carried so far for several hours with no issues at all, and like its not even on my back.

Your back breathes exceptionally well thanks to the airflow from the elevation off your back from the shoulder straps and crazy thick lumbar pad, something Mystery Ranch's packs are cruddy at. For those of you that have any experience with an ALICE pack or the newer Polymer framed Assault packs, breathability is on par with that.

You could toss this around the back-country like you were fighting it for your life and nothing would break. That's a quality I like in a pack (especially after seeing peope in the middle of no-where with their packs held together by electrical tape and paracord). Plus it (mostly) stands up on its own (although it can tip over) and that's something the Mystery Ranch packs cant do!

Cons are the adjustment system to dial it in is a bit of a pain (you have to unhook the lumbar pad which is under tension, then manually adjust each shoulder strap, then re-attach). It took me several goes to get it where I liked it. The same process needs to be repeated for the hip-belt removal, plus you need to actually replace parts of the shoulder straps with webbing that attaches directly to the pack (the straps themselves attach to the hip belt stock), and this takes a few minutes to do.

It's not for taller guys either if you want any load lift, unless you have a really short torso. I'm 5'9"" and the load lifters are only just giving me lift with a 30 degree angle. If you are much taller than me, and/or have an abnormally long torso, you wont get much lift with those load lifters due to the 22"" stays. The longer shoulder straps should help there (I got the short ones) due to the placement of the load lifter anchors.

It's a pricey, but utterly fantastic one bag carry on option for those of us that want to do longish outdoor hikes/ through hikes at our destinations in total comfort, or who desire a max capacity and comfy and durable pack that can be expanded to carry a ton of stuff at your destination if needed.

We researched and researched, bought special items including ultralight gear (not cheap), etc. We started the trip and on the way cross country, my highly athletic friend hurt his toe so he didn't feel like he could actually hike with a large pack on without seriously injuring his foot. What's more ironic is that his toe stopped hurting about the time we headed back from the trip which turned into a car camping road trip, not a backpacking trip. 

I can't help but feel extremely disappointed. I wouldn't say I didn't have a good time, but now that I've returned I've gone from disappointed to pissed off that this happened. Part of me wants to say that it was all a sham and he never really hurt his foot, but I don't truly think that happened. I don't necessarily want to make him feel bad either but it did ruin the trip for me in ways I can't explain well.

Perhaps it's because I felt ready for this adventure and that adventure was taken from me in some way. I cannot repeat this trip for at least another year and not sure if I'll ever be able to again.

For many years I used an old cheap sleeping bag without any information about for what temperature it fits. But all this time I went on more than one day hikes only in summer, when the night temperature in my country (Belarus) doesn’t fall lower than 10-12 °C (it can be really for one-two days during the whole season), so this bag was enough for me.

But this year my old friend died (bag, not real friend), and I decided to buy something light and compact. I found a nice sleeping bag with 550 gram weight and **Men's comfort temperature:** 10 ° C. There was another two numbers: **Women's comfort temperature:** 14 ° C and **Extreme temperature:** 0 ° C. Extreme temperature is useless for most of the common people, it’s something like “you won’t freeze to the death being dressed in the warm clothes and being in a sleeping bag”. Some articles tell, that you can “uncomfortably sleep for 6 hours”, but I think, that the authors of these articles didn’t try it by their own, he-he.

I bought this bag and went outdoors for 5 days. The night temperature in the weather forecast was approximately 9-10 °C. And at the first night I understood, that this temperature numbers don’t tell the truth. I went to sleep in the evening, being dressed in a one layer of standard thermal underwear, and after two hours I awakened, feeling cold. I put on second layer of warm thermal underwear, but I didn’t feel the comfort again. Finally I felt asleep only when I put on another warm blouse. Last night the temperature was near 8-9 ° C and I additionally put on my jacket.

So, all I want to say – don’t trust this numbers. They are written for somebody, who can sleep undressed on the open snow for a while. I don’t afraid low temperatures, last autumn I was taking a short bath in a lake, almost covered with ice, but this men's comfort temperature, written on the bag, is not for me. 15 ° C is near the truth, when you sleep in thin thermal underwear.

Also recognize I’m going to get roasted for this, but I wish I had this information before attempting this trail and I hope to help anybody else who choses to trek in this area. We are somewhat experienced backpackers (I did 200ish miles of the Colorado Trail last summer, we hiked portions of Shenandoah together in October 2020, he’s done some other longer hikes etc.) and had done a lot of online prep work for our hikes in Kyrgyzstan as this would be both of our first times trekking abroad. We based much of our trek planning on information from the tourist organization Destination Karakol and from the travel blog Against the Compass. We decided we would do two hikes based on everything we read online, both two nights and three days. In terms of maps we had the trail maps and locations available both on AllTrails Pro and on Maps.Me. I thought about putting waypoints into my Garmin inReach mini, but decided against it. We also considered buying paper maps from Destination Karakol, but decided it was not worth it because we saw it in person and it contained no information we did not already have. 

The first trek we planned was up and over Archa Tör pass at \~12,800 feet. The day breakdown for that hike was basically an 18 mile day one, 6 mile day two, and roughly 10-12 mile day three, ending in the resort of Jeti-Oguz, where we would catch a cheap taxi back to Karakol. The first day started from the town of Kyzyl-Suu, about thirty minutes west of our AirBnb in Karakol. We took a shared taxi from the Southern Bus Station at the corner of Toktogul and Torgoeva Streets (a little north of the Afghan and Pushkin Parks) which cost 70 Som (\~85 cents) each to Kyzyl-Suu. From there the trail instructions were to basically follow a road to a checkpoint that was marked on both Maps.Me and AllTrails, roughly 6-7 miles from the town. It is possible to get another taxi to this checkpoint, but we chose to hoof it. Past the checkpoint was another about 5-6 miles to the crossing of a number of rickety bridges over a relatively large (unfordable imo) river. The scenery was fine, nothing spectacular yet, choosing to get a taxi would be a reasonable option. Around 15 miles from the town of Kyzyl-Suu on the trail (which still was basically a 4X4 road), we hit a hot springs establishment/resort type thing. After this it was another 3ish miles on a slight uphill to our camping spot for the night, which was when the river valley really opened up and the trail on AllTrails split into two. It was in a gorgeous field right by the river with a good amount of cow poop at about 8,300 feet. 

After a nice night there we started on day two, which was short, but with over 3000 feet of gain, only about 6 miles. At the start there were two options for the trail, to stay on the right of the river (going against the current) or to go to the left. The right was what it seemed like Against the Compass recommended, but we decided to go to the left, which was on AllTrails. The trail more or less disappeared pretty quickly and it was a little swampy/boggy, but all in all it was a fine choice and saved us \~100 som each bc on the other side of the river hikers pay nomadic Kyrgyz kids to pull them across on a cable car. After that, the trail continued upwards, mostly seeming like a 4X4 road, before turning into single-track maybe 2 miles from where we camped the night prior. A half mile from there or so the AllTrails instructions split, to the left had more consistent gain up to about 10,000 feet (from maybe 9,000-9,200 feet) over like 1-1.5 miles, the right took us back down to the river before shooting us up and rejoining the other trail. We decided (wrongly) to go to the right. The trail disappeared no more than 10 minutes after the split and sent us basically crawling up the banks of a tributary and then climbing up to a flatter section and fighting through some incredibly dense, 5ish foot tall juvenile juniper forest. This was all on the AllTrails trail according to our phone location tracking, which was not a great sign. That mile-plus took us probably an hour. We eventually made it back to where the trails re-met up. Following this, was single track horse trail for another 2 or so miles up the last 1,300 feet to 11,300 feet, mostly following the stream whose banks we were crawling on earlier. This section had a pretty solid trail, easily followable. Had to get past a herd of cattle at 11,000 feet, but it was pretty simple. We hit our camping location on a flat area by the stream by 1:00 pm. We were about 0.75 - 1 mile from the pass itself, basically directly west of the pass. After a cold night there (it snowed overnight a little) we got up early to hit the pass and all that. 

Day three was a mess and a half. The pass had no discernible trail and was mostly loose slate scree, which had gotten damp from the snow the night before. About 800 feet of gain in half a mile or less of “trail.” We zig-zagged up to the top, reaching it and the other side was considerably more steep. Probably was a 45+ degree angle across the entire side with a bunch of snow on the ground (we hiked in mid-June). There were some spots without snow, so we decided to descend there, and figure out the AllTrails stuff when we reached the base. We basically crawled along the underside of the pass for 75-100 feet before we hit a flat enough pitch that we felt somewhat comfortable to decline. It took us an hour plus to descend, kinda half skating down the scree or carefully going over some loose boulder fields until we hit a flatter section. Had to cross a small boulder field before hitting the first confidence markers (a spray painted arrow and a cairn) of the entire trip. After that was another pretty aggressive descent, but this time on single-track with a number of confidence markers. It rained/snowed/sleeted on us, but this was the easiest and best part of day three. Following this section the trail dropped us in another river valley, which was fine, again some single track in spots, otherwise without a trail. The vegetation (mainly grasses and some alpine flowers) was lush and soaked, quickly soaking our shoes/socks. The trail type thing more or less followed the stream until the start of what was supposed to be another steep descent through some thick forest before hitting the valley floor and another, bigger river. The trail eventually dropped us in some more of the juvenile juniper forest I described from day two, but it was worse. It was a few feet taller and there were little to not patches of actual grass, just pure thick juniper forest that had no trail. According to Maps.Me and AllTrails we were maybe 150 feet south of the trail (i.e. we were 150 feet closer to the stream, which we were currently close to the north bank of). We attempted to push through the juniper, crawling over and under branches and trees, hoping that the trail had been cut into the basically impassable forest or something. We were wrong. Directly on trail according to both mapping services and there was nothing except more juniper. We continued to try to push through it down the hill, we knew we had maybe a mile or two to the next river valley, which we visualized as pretty open from the top of the hill prior to the juniper mess. It was hell. Maybe a quarter of a mile an hour. I had my camp shoes ripped out of the outside mesh pocket of my 2016 Osprey Atomos 50 by the trees. My hiking partner lost his gloves from his zip hip belt pocket. Everything got wet in the forest and our, admittedly cheap, frog togg rain pants were ripped to shreds. We eventually realized pushing through the forest was futile. We found a semblance of a cattle trail down the mountain and literally slid on our butts to the side of the river, which was maybe an eighth of a mile down the hill. We were very lucky to find something that open. At the banks of the river it was a pretty difficult fording, it was narrow and moving pretty quickly. We got wet to our knees or so, not that it really mattered as we were soaked to the bone already. The other side of the river (the south bank), was, for whatever reason, considerably more open and, by the time we crossed, we probably had about a mile down to the larger, more open river valley we would follow north into Jeti-Oguz, following the flow of the river. At this point we had been on trail for \~5 hours, we were soaked, over a half mile off the trail according to our maps, but really moving for the first time in probably 2+ hours. We made it down the hill and to the larger river valley with relative ease. We had initially planned to hike the last 7+ miles to the resort, find another shared taxi, and ride back to Karakol. Given our condition though, we decided it was necessary to get off trail as soon as possible. At the base of the trail there was a nomadic camp, but they were unable to help us. We chose to cross the river at that point to the east bank (the smaller river valley dropped us to the west bank of the bigger river). There were two pine tree trunks next to each other sling across the stream in a rough approximation of a bridge, probably 20 feet above the stream itself. We chose to crawl across it, which was an unnerving experience. Once we crossed the river, we just followed various horse tracks on the bank, which were covered in various livestock poops, for roughly two miles until we hit a nomadic camp that had a car we could hire (for the relatively exorbitant fee of 2000 soms or \~$20 total) to take us back to Karakol. If you chose to hike the remaining distance to the Jeti Oguz resort, as we had initially planned, I would estimate it would have been an additional \~5 miles, but quite easy, following a river on a road, mostly downhill. 

That is the trip report. If I had any advice for folks looking to complete the Archa Tor pass trek, I would highly highly recommend starting in Kyzyl-Suu and just completing it as an out and back. The first day was a great hiking day, the second was also good, certainly better scenery, provided you go left at the fork point. I would then suggest the morning of the third day, go up (without full packs) to the top of the pass, the view is outstanding, and then just follow your steps back to Kyzyl-Suu and, eventually, Karakol. Completing the third day was a new circle of hell I would not wish upon anybody. ",backpacking,"Archa Tor Pass Trail near Karakol, Kyrgyzstan",https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/oh8cvz/archa_tor_pass_trail_near_karakol_kyrgyzstan/

One (of many) reasons for wanting one of these more ""advanced"" purifiers over the more common, cheaper, filters are planned trips in the US Midwest where Mercury contamination in the water can be a problem, at times exceeding EPA limits for human consumption in lakes and rivers. 

To keep this as short as I can, Geopress, between their operators manual and answer section on Amazon, indicates it is minimally effective against Mercury, and only suited for removing trace amounts of heavy metals. Geopress also clearly indicates in their user materials what it is not suited for filtering (large scale metal pollution, salt water, algae blooms, nuclear waste, etc). 

The S3 on the other hand, advertises explicitly on their website that it will filter out mercury down to .5 ppb. When I look at the testing data they post, it shows that with an input of .001 mg/l they were able to reduce the amount present to &lt;.001 mg/l. Without giving more specific data, it indicates a &gt;99% reduction in the mercury present. At first glance, this seems like a more effective tool than the Geopress.

However, the data provided by the S3 also indicates that the EPA limit on mercury contamination is .002 mg/l. So with a starting input at half the EPA limit, it would seem the testing was done on what could be fairly called ""trace amounts"" anyway. What is more, the S3 doesn't have a section like the Geopress describing it's limitations, or indicating what it is not suited or designed to filter. Perhaps the S3 is a super filter that really can clean substantial industrial contamination, etc. But that seems unlikely...

If the S3 really provides superior performance, I would go with the S3. But all other things being more or less equal, I would go with the Geopress. And I can't tell if the S3 really performs better, or if they are just talking up the same performance offered by the Geopress, while the Geopress is being more honest about the capabilities of their product. Is there anyone here who knows anything about all this? Or who can point me in the right direction?",backpacking,"Water Purification Sawyer S3 vs Geopress (mercury, etc.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/ogp42q/water_purification_sawyer_s3_vs_geopress_mercury/

**Why we built it**

Because I’m commuting and traveling a lot, choosing the right backpack is crucial for me. choosing the right backpack is crucial for me. When I was recently looking for a new backpack, I realized that I’m spending countless hours doing product research by reading many reviews from different sources.

The biggest pain points are:

* Sponsored content / Ads
* Fake reviews
* It takes time
* Inconsistent metrics and info across sites

To get trustworthy reviews, I’m often ending up on Reddit. The challenges here are:

* Many duplicate posts/requests
* Bad search
* Scattered information

I started asking myself, why isn’t there a service that makes product research less complicated, more transparent, and less time-consuming?

That’s why we launched [baqpa.com](https://baqpa.com/) to help you find the best backpack.

**How it works**

Using the newest Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, we’ve built a service that collects product reviews from all over the web, filters and aggregates them, and presents the summarized results in a short and understandable form.

Our core features are:

* Automated review collection  

   * Consumer (Amazon, Walmart, etc.)
   * Article (Wirecutter, etc.)
   * Video (YouTube, etc.)
   * Community (Reddit, etc.)
* Review relevance/helpfulness rating
* Fake detection
* Sentiment analysis
* Keyword extraction
* Short summaries

**What’s next:**

* Automatically collect and aggregate reviews from backpacks that get submitted from this community.
* Analyzing more Reddit posts and Youtube videos
* Running statistical analyses to spot discrepancies and contradictions among reviews and filter out fake reviews.
* More filters like availability, airline compatibility, warranty, gender
* Tracking different versions

Your favorite backpack is not on the list yet? Just use the submission form, and we’ll collect and analyze all the reviews for it. Once we're done, we'll notify you with an email.

Let me know what you think!",backpacking,"My friends and I created a website that analyzes thousands of backpack reviews from Amazon, blogs, YouTube, Reddit, and more.

My last pair of old model (2016?) REI sahara's just got shredded by chaparral bushwhacking and I need new pants. I have a pair of the new Sahara and it's okay, but I'd like something closer to the feel, fit, and durability of the old kind. Preferrably even thicker and more durable if that's possible. 

Unfortunately it seems like REI and all the other manufacturers are moving towards selling hiking pants that are meant for hanging out in breweries and looking fashionable rather than serious outdoor activity. You know, tight fitting, small pockets, shitty fabric, etc. Great for hanging out but not ideal for the trail.

Not trying to rag or anything, I just really need pants that actually work for the purpose. I hike and paraglide a lot and so I need something that's loose, comfortable, fast drying, has good zippered cargo pockets, and can take a beating.

I am a student from Germany who is finishing his master thesis in the end of the year (around October/November). My major is something like industrial engineering or engineering &amp; management. My whole CV is meant for an automotive career since I didn't really do anything else the last years lol.

So here's the thing:

Since I don't really want to enter the 9-5 job life in Germany right after my graduation, I am looking for ideas to have at least some reasons to go abroad, ideally for working and getting some payment. Doesn't really have to be the subject I am made for, can be anything. But I would like to see the world a little bit more as long as I am young, for example more of Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) or an english speaking country to get more fluent in speaking.

I thought about a gap year as a teacher in Asia, but unfortunately I'm not a native english speaker and that is the most common thing there. In the end I actually just seek for more foreign experience because I love speaking foreign languages and learning about other cultures and that's it.

Here is one of my favorite trail snacks to make before I head out hiking/backpacking

They are called energy balls! They are easy to make, customize, and prepare. The carbohydrates are what provides the energy source! They are so easy and convenient, I had to share them with other travelers!

Ingredients:

* Nut Butter (Peanut, Almond, Cashew, etc)
* Honey/Agave
* Quick Oats
* Any other small add-ins

Instructions:

* spoonful of Peanut Butter, then add ½ cup of oats
* combine those two together like a ball
* add a tablespoon of honey and slowly add more oats as well while still combining ingredients
* Once a consistency is found, add in small tasty treats (mini chocolate chips, chia seeds, mini-M&amp;Ms, coconut shreds)
* Roll the dough into small balls in the palm of your hand (customizable if you prefer smaller or larger portions)
* Place into the fridge for at least 20 minutes and pack it up into a small tupperware or reusable bag

Some Pro Tips:

* The amount of oats used will vary based on the nut butter that is used. If the nut butter you’re using is high in oil, there will need to be more oats to absorb the oil so the balls can be properly formed.

Some were a pain, some were great, and some were meh. Travelling alone is also good but sometimes it also sucks when loneliness kicks in. Anyway, here are my tips listed below:

1). **Make sure you are travelling with the right people.** And by “right” I mean you should know them well and know you have similar taste and preferences. I have travelled with people that made me realize too late that we just don’t “click” and made the rest of the trip a nightmare. Travelling alone is good, traveling with the right people to hang out with is also equally good (at least for me). But travelling with the wrong people makes you wish you hadn't travelled at all.

2). **Make sure everyone is committed before booking.** If someone in the group cancels, there may be a fee and the group may need to chip in which can be a real pain sometimes. I know I have experienced this several times. I personally use [Gypsee Travel ](http://gypsee.travel/)for bookings as we can invite other friends easily and any money not committed to the trip is refunded.

3.) **Don’t be afraid to break off with the rest of the group.** You don’t have to do everything together. Unlike horror movies which are a bad idea sometimes when breaking up, sometimes going your own way is more enjoyable too. (Just don’t get lost lol) You can then just meet at a specific time and location to regroup.

4). **Plan on Budgets.** Be mindful that everyone in the group has different financial situations and therefore, different preferences too. Everything must be planned out first from dining, where to sleep, where to go next, etc. You could use apps like [Splitwise ](http://splitwise.com/)for the division of expenses, and after all of that has been settled, use [Venmo](http://venmo.com/) for payments.

5). (Optional) but, **travel with photographer friends if possible** lol. I once travelled with people who sucks at taking pictures. I took good pictures of them but when it’s their time to take mine, it doesn’t look as good. On some travels I’ve had though, I have good pictures taken from friends who are photographers themselves. A lot of them look very majestic and instagrammable lol. My favotrite editing app to use is [VSCO](https://vsco.co/).

Space is not too much an issue, but the typical munchies snacks of candy (heavy) and chips (bulky and easily crushable) do not necessarily lend themselves well to backcountry living.

I’m researching the hygiene practices of long-distance hikers, especially as it relates to toileting and menstruation. I’m hoping to gain some insight into whether certain practices or products (such as pee rags, bidets, genital grooming, menstrual cups, and genital application of deodorants, creams, or powders) are associated with health issues while on the trail, like skin rashes or infections.

If you are planning (or have already completed) a hike of 5 or more days in duration in 2021, and would be willing to take a very brief survey, please use the link below to register. If you’re planning multiple hikes of this length this year, feel free to register multiple times (once for each hike).

In particular, I’m hoping to get a unit that will work on a 9-day outing in the Sierra this August.

I’ve been looking at Garmin devices but the billion versions of each model are SO confusing. Currently, I’m between the Instinct Solar as my budget pick, the Fenix 5+/5X+, and Fenix 6 for more advanced features. Maybe the Forerunner, but it seems geared toward running and I'm not a runner at ALL. (Also, please pardon me if I use GPS terms incorrectly, I'm totally new to this world)

Non-negotiable features:
- Wearable
- Largely Reliable ABC (Altitude/Barometer/Compass)
- Largely Reliable Heart Rate
- Pedometer
- Activity Tracking
- Ability to follow a pre-set track 
- Mark waypoints on the device (points interest on the trail, side trips, evacuation route)
- Strong Battery Life 
- Durable design

Debatably necessary features (More below):
- Maps viewable on the watch.

Wishlist features:
- Solar Glass
- Pulse Ox sensor
- Low weight

Necessary items: Basically, I want to track my 9-day trip, elevation gain, mileage, steps, calories. I have a great sense of direction and memory for trails, but I have a couple of key cross-country passes with false-passes that make it difficult; thus a set track will help me with staying on course. Durability is also important as we will be doing class 2/3 routes.

I also want the battery to either last for 9 days -or- need minimal charging. Solar versions would help, but I will be bringing a 10,000 mAh battery backup which will charge my phone 2x+. My phone will be on Airplane mode but will still be used as my camera, reference book (Secor), and maybe a little music. I'm not sure how much charge my phone will use, or how much a watch needs to recharge so I don't think I can have reliable info on that before buying the watch which tempts me to buy the Solar Instinct or the X verisons of the Fenix though I probably cannot afford them.

Maps: I know watches with topo maps are hard to read at times but it seems that instances of injury/weather/wildfire may need improv evacuation via a non-preset route. I think preloaded or downloadable topo maps could be a very useful safety feature here. I will have a paper map/button/compass as backup (always), but figuring out which watch models have topo/road maps viewable IS A HUGE ISSUE. I think the Fenix 5+/5X+ and the advanced (pricy) 6 pro or 6x/s pro have preloaded maps, but I cannot tell whether the Fenix 6 (regular) has maps downloaded or allows you to download maps. I know you can download tracks on the Instinct Solar but can you also DL maps on the Instinct Solar too?

Another question, I know you can preload tracks to follow on all models, but can you punch in coordinates, or select a spot on the map for a side trip? If so, which models?

I've tried to find videos and reviews but often such content is buried in readily available information that I don't need. I need the opinion of someone familiar. As for different training features, a lot of that is cool but anything not listed is totally peripheral (I couldn't care less about music storage).

Also, if you can think of a better fit than the three models I list, please chime in.

This past week myself (late 20s), dad (early 60s) and two younger sisters (early 20s) had a permit to do a 2 night backpacking trip in Hetch Hetchy of Yosemite National Park. I've been on my fair share of backpacking trips and have logged somewhere close to 200 miles total between a handful of trips, so I wouldn't call myself a novice, yet wouldn't quite give myself the title of ""experienced backpacker"". Most of these trips have been solo or with a new group of backpacking friends I found, so I was super excited to take my Dad and sister on their very first backcountry experience (my other sister has done two one-night backpacking trips before). 
Unfortunately, as the 6/17 start date to our permit started approaching, we found out that we would be hit with a massive heat wave during the exact time we were supposed to be out on the trail. I originally wasn't too worried, and was even a little excited that I'd be able to take a couple layers that I would no longer need out of my pack.  

We get to the trailhead and it was HOT, weather reports were saying the high would be somewhere in the high 90’s, but the car was showing outdoor temperatures as high as 101 on the way - at 10:30AM! I was starting to get nervous of the heat making the trip potentially miserable for my dad and sisters, but they seemed chipper as they started to put the finishing touches on packing their bags. As we are wrapping up, a group of a dad with his two late teens/early 20’s sons walked up to the parking lot and told us that yesterday a ranger had advised them it was probably a good idea to get off the trail due to the heat wave. I had never heard of a ranger telling people to get off trail for anything other than a fire, so this made my anxiety about the trip skyrocket. However, my sisters and Dad didn’t seem to be fazed by the news. We decided to press on. 

We finally started hiking...and boy oh boy was I feeling bad almost immediately.  Temps were close to or over 100 and the first 5-6 miles of the trail walking along the reservoir are almost totally exposed. I had some Mio Sport mix in my water, but I was sweating like crazy and could feel my energy draining extremely quickly. Each step was getting harder and harder, and we were only 3 miles in. After 2.5ish hours of hiking we stopped at the base of Wapama Falls to catch our breath, refill our water and try to cool off a bit in the pools at the base. I was super glad to finally get some cold, refreshing mountain water, but the day and season were so unusually warm that the water running down the falls felt like it was at room temperature. I filtered and drank the water while I sat at the edge of the pool, and it just wasn’t cooling me down. 

A wave of dread came over me envisioning what we were in store on the trip. I was getting worried the trip would be miserable, as I’ve never felt this bad on any of my previous trips, and we weren’t even 10% of the way done with our overall route. 


I asked the rest of the group whether they wanted to keep going and they seemed surprised that I was asking. I was very vocal about how I was worried about how miserable this heat would make our trip, about how we haven’t even gotten to the first climb of the trail and how hard and hot that would be, about how the campsite we were planning on staying at would be exposed as well, and how we would probably be sweating in our tents that night. I didn’t pull any punches when it came to expressing my concerns, but I also finished with “but it’s totally up to you guys, I just don’t want there to be any surprises.”

After talking about it for a couple more minutes, they decided that we should call it. Immediately I was relieved that it would only be a few more miles and hours until we would be back into a car with air conditioning, but as soon as we started the drive back to the backpackers campsite I was hit with regret and disappointment. 

I feel like I let my Dad and sisters down. While I have the most backpacking experience out of us and am in pretty good shape (exercise 3-4x week), I am definitely in the worst shape out of us 4 and could tell that they weren’t struggling as much as I was. I felt as though my struggles were the biggest reason they decided to bail on the trip, not the heat. I feel as though I gave in as soon as it got difficult, as I know deep down I could have pushed through and made it. 
Overall I know it was the “safe” and maybe even the “responsible” thing to do, but I am still super bummed out that this trip was a failure. My Dad and sisters seemed very excited to get out there with me and spent a good amount of money on gear to be able to go out with me on this, and I feel terrible about that. Sure, we can always go on another trip and one of my sisters is already trying to plan a local one night trip - but it would have been amazing to have their first trip out there in Yosemite. 

Mostly just posting this to vent and to get my disappointment in myself off my chest. I know this experience will help me push on through hard times in future trips, and hopefully in life.

On the other hand, the Garmin app has horrendous reviews in the app store, and Zoleo has great reviews.

Note: for anyone else looking, the price difference might not be as big as you think. Zoleo requires that you lock in a plan for 3 months, whereas Garmin let's you immediately go month to month.

We were one of the only people on the trail that day and things were quiet. We made plenty of noise the entire time and both of us carried bear spray. 

We set up camp a little late and ended up having to hang our bear bag after dark with our headlamps on. In the middle of hanging, I heard something walking on the large scree rocks directly behind us; it must have been less than 50m away, and it was big enough to cause the scree rocks to move (so it couldn't have been a rodent). Because it was pitch black at this point, I couldn't make it out. However I took no chances, unholstered my spray, and started shouting like crazy in the direction of the noise. The walking stopped, and a minute or so later we seemed to hear it on the rocks much further away before the sound disappeared.

After that, we hauled ass, hung our bear bag, and ran to our tent that was roughly 200m away. My partner and I were both scared shitless, I made her wear earplugs to bed while I stayed awake the entire night. I only heard coyotes in the far distance, but I was bracing myself to hear a bear trying to get at our bear hang or approach our tent all night long. I figured our packs and skin still had food scent from our cooking so were very much of interest to any bear lurking nearby. 

The next morning, our bear hang was undisturbed and we were a little more at ease. However, I still have several questions about this incident. What could that animal have been, if not a bear? What could I have done differently? If it was a bear, potentially a grizzly one, how much of a threat were we under?

**Starter Gear Guide**

General Notes

 * This entire list is my personal opinion and is designed to give a new group or individual guidance on selecting starter gear.
 * REI and Kelty are pretty good budget backpacking companies in general, hard to make a mistake with them. 
 * Item headers highlighted in yellow are best treated as group gear meaning one per 2-4 people traveling. 
 * If you are heading to a national park, call the ranger station and consult with their backcountry office, the more information you have getting started, the better off your trip will be.

Equipment 

* Hiking boots or shoes 
 * Walk some before trying on shoes, to get feet warm and expand, to mimic what they’ll be  like on trail  
 * Must be tested in a store wearing wool socks and liner socks to get the correct fit. 
 * Must be broken in prior to a big trip. (50 miles or so) 

* Backpack 
 * Must be tested with weight. 
 * Try different manufacturers. 
 * Osprey, Gregory, and REI seem to be the top 3 most popular but all fit/feel very different. 
 * 50 liters would be a good place to start, sufficient for long weekends, but may have to share gear for a week long trip, depending on packing. 

* Tents (GROUP)
 * Generally they underrate tent sizes by a person, so a 2 man tent is comfortable for 1 person and gear. 
 * Free standing tents can be used everywhere. 

* Sleeping bag 
 * Pick a 3 season bag, ~30° rating for first purchase. 
 * Synthetic insulation still imparts warmth when wet but does not compress as well and is  heavier than down. 
 * Upgrade to a summer bag to save some weight later on. 

* Sleeping pad 
 * Necessary.
 * If you need more cushion, the blow up pads give it but make some loud aluminum foil  sounds when you move and can be terrible if you are a light sleeper. 
 * Pads that self inflate are typically heavier than the others, suggested to avoid for first purchase.
 * Another good item to try before buying.

* Stove and fuel (GROUP)
 * Jet boils are the standard outdoors but can be a little heavy.
 * Want super light weight and to feel like an old timey railrider? Alcohol penny stove. 
 * Can be made for free with stuff laying around your house. 
 * Liquid fuel stoves can be more trouble than they are worth and heavy for starting out.
 * Small single pot butane stoves are cheap and light with easily available fuel.
 * Altitude can be a concern, consult trip plan.

* Kitchen supplies 
 * Long handled titanium spork is the best thing I've found. 

* Plenty of food 
 * Easiest option is backpacker pantry freeze dried/dehydrated dinners, packet oatmeal for  breakfast or pop tarts, trail mix for snacks, beef sticks / salami / tortillas / hard cheese for lunch, instant coffee.
 * Cheaper option for dinners is dried pasta sides or rice sides, tuna and/or spam, ethnic aisle dried meals, and ramen.
 * Typical weight works out to 1 - 2 lbs of food per day.
 * Aim calorie intake higher than everyday requirement, ~500 per day
 * Food dehydrator is awesome to make your own snacks and meals but not necessary to start.

* Water bottles
 * 1L Smart water bottles or knock off styles make excellent trail bottles.
 * Suggested to carry at least 2, one for flavoring/electrolytes and the other for plain water.
 * Water bladders make it easier to stay hydrated but are more costly.

* Water treatment supplies (GROUP)
 * Sawyer mini or Sawyer Squeeze for a water filter, can't be beat. 

* Weather-appropriate clothing 
 * Polyester, synthetic materials, or wool for hiking. 
 * NO HIKING IN COTTON. COTTON KILLS. 
 * Poncho or frog togs for personal rain gear. 
 * Contractor trash bag inside of the backpack that all equipment gets stuffed into for  waterproofing. 
 * Example loadout for fair weather: a pair of above knee shorts, pants, 2 pairs of athletic boxers, 2 pairs of liner socks, 3 pairs of wool socks, belt if necessary, 2 athletic shirts, 1 warmer long sleeve shirt, puffy jacket no hood, hat, 2 handkerchiefs or 1 handkerchief and a buff

* Emergency and hygiene supplies 
 * Small container of body glide or friction defense 
 * Moleskin 
 * Aspirin 
 * Anti-diarrheal 
 * Ibuprofen 
 * Hand sanitizer 
 * TP 
 * Band Aids 
 * Safety pin 
 * Allergy meds

A large decline in first unemployment claims published by the Department of Labor in mid-March, marking the lowest levels seen yet during the pandemic, is one evidence that the economic impact of the coronavirus may be diminishing. Airports just experienced their busiest days in almost a year, which is another sign of growing economic activity. While the United States and the rest of the world still have a long way to go before returning to pre-coronavirus normalcy, there are signs of recovery—and with vaccines on the way, there is a growing sense of confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

""We've found that essential business travelers have continued to take to the skies and the roads throughout the pandemic, though in a somewhat limited capacity, while others, including students, have tended to stay closer to home,"" says Mobile Edge's VP of Marketing, who specializes in producing protective laptop cases, backpacks, and other accessories. ""Consumers have grown to rely on Mobile Edge for peace of mind in organizing and preserving their pricey computer gear and precious data, regardless of their situation, whether they've remained on-the-go or worked or learned from home.""

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody knows what the year 2021 will bring in terms of travel, mobility, and the possibility of a return to more traditional work and education settings. Although the indications are there, and airlines and hotels continue to operate under stricter safety and sanitation standards, most consumers appear to be taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach. Professionals and students, meanwhile, want solutions for safeguarding, organizing, and powering their laptops, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, and other peripherals.

&amp;#x200B;

Mobile Edge updated seven of its most popular laptop cases and backpacks for professionals and students with its Graphite line, using superior, tough ""Graphite"" nylon material for an edgier, distinctive, ""industrial"" aesthetic. Each is backed by a lifetime warranty and a guarantee of complete customer satisfaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Professionals will appreciate Mobile Edge's Graphite Nylon Briefcase's organized and protective features, as well as its elegant style, which includes leather-wrapped handles and a matching removable shoulder strap. Its dedicated, padded computer compartment accommodates PC computers up to 16 inches and Mac laptops up to 17 inches, and its easy-access workstation, quick-access rear magazine pocket, and interior file section keep accessories organized and accessible.

&amp;#x200B;

The Graphite SmartPack Backpack may be more appealing to students. It's a no-nonsense backpack for those who value both security and a simple approach to aesthetics. It's ergonomically built and lightweight. It has separate padded internal sleeves for a laptop and tablet, as well as enough of room for books, paperwork, and other essentials.

&amp;#x200B;

Both students and professionals benefit from mobile power. The Core Power AC USB 27,000mAh Portable Laptop Charger is great for power-hungry laptops, gaming consoles, and other devices, while the 10,000mAh 18W PD+QC Fast Charge High-Capacity Power Bank is suitable for charging tablets, smartphones, and smaller USB devices, thanks to its universal AC outlet.

We both have plenty of international travel experience and speak english and spanish very well (english primary language).

Of those three listed above, do you recommend that as far as places to visit? if so, how come, any and all advice/recommendations are greatly appreciated. Next, what other countries do you recommend?

My pack weighs about 50lbs whereas my fiance's pack weighs about 32lbs (neither of us are ""in shape,"" but I am a bit more active and am confident taking on a bulk of the weight).

Luckily, we aren't going on a very long hike (a few miles max).  This is our first time out and we choose a shorter hike as a test bed to determine where we can improve.  I had to cave and let her take on the bear canister as she had the room available.

Even before going out I have determined a few things:

1.) I can probably get away with a smaller cooking system.  Currently using a SoloStove as it was a cheap starter option that gives me the ability to use gas or wood to cook with. However, this one gives me the option to store some items that I don't mind if they get a little soot on them to help decrease volume.

2.) While I don't yet think I'd be able to get away with a smaller tent, I definitely think I can find a lighter one. If things work out I *might* be able to get away with a three person tent.  This is up to the dogs and how well they get along in the more spacious setup (they get on rackets nerves at home so well see how it goes).  I really like the tent we have as it includes a front vestibule and didn't cost to much. No tent or open tent isn't really an option for us. I was genuinely surprised I made this work after a few different opening attempts.

3.) I should invest in a water bladder. Preferable one with a soda bottle sized opening that I could attach a Sawyer filter to and use as a gravity feed system. I currently have their 1 gallon gravity fed system bag filled about 2/3 of the way and stored in the bladder pouch, but I'm concerned about it pooping. I'm not sure how well their material holds up.  We'll see if this is a bad idea.

4.) I now understand the need to disperse gear. For instance, it would have been a better option to get two bear canisters and have each of us carry our own food.  Will definitely do this in the future if the fiance shows interest in doing it again. Still getting a smaller one for solo hikes.

My problem was wanting to pack for two while trying to make sure my fiance has the best possible experience, while wanting the gear I bought to be compatible with a single-person trip (with the dogs if she wanted to do something else during that time) if she decided it's not for her.

I looked way more amount of items. I'm living in Azerbaijan(which is sadly a third world country) so they are quite expensive. But I found an interesting item. That was kerosene stove. I looked for all kind of stoves in marketplaces and online stores.

The butane type gas stoves are expensive, something like Jetboil kinda stuff is way to much money just for stove and etc.

Then I found a good kerosene stove. They are very cheap and as I watched the videos they are doing really well. In my country 1 liter of kerosene costs about 2 manat which is about 1.18 USD.

It seems very good deal for me.


Now here comes a question. I watched different videos about kerosene stoves but cannot find the approximate efficiency of it. Like how much kerosene do I need to make a meal, or boil water.

Also there is one more... I cannot find that if it's useful for backpacking or not. There are people saying that it's good choice but cannot make it sure.

Hope you can help me. Wish you all good day and good travels!",backpacking,Kerosene stoves,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/o1g0wc/kerosene_stoves/

I’m new to the game of backpacking and finally looking to step down from my heavy car camping tent to a backpacking tent. What are your favorite tents under $200 for a 2 person tent? Should I go for a standard free standing or make the switch to a trekking pole tent? Why or why not? I’m a pretty experienced camper but just never took up “backpacking” if that makes sense.

Looking to do 3 days/2 nights. To give you some perspective: we recently did a 1 night/2 day, 15mi, 3k elevation trip and it was tough for me (it was Granite, Dicks, Velma and Eagle lake in Desolation Wilderness Tahoe). The majority of the elevation gain was day 1 and there was quite a bit of snow still. So I'd like to keep the elevation gain a little lower or easier so that I can actually have fun.

Mostly for use on trails, but there are some pretty taxing trails around here.  I owned a pair of salomons from ages ago that are time to retire. I recently bought the outback 500 gtx which fit great when i tried them on, but once i wore them with some light/ midweight socks, they are way too narrow. I tried the salomon x ultra mid 4s and they seemed narrow as well, and i really don't have that wide of feet. I see they have a wide version, but not locally to try on. I've also read mixed reviews they are VERY wide.I really like the light weight and function of the salomons, but the fit just doesn't agree with my foot. I have tried on almost every boot at REI, but i don't like how heavy and stiff a lot of the boots are. If you have experience with salomon in recent years, do they break in after a bit? Or are they just extremely narrow? What are your boots of choice?

The tent fits well into the bag in came with age isn't that large, but doesn't seem to compress much beyond that.  I sprung for the Osprey Aether Plus 60 which has loops with buckles just outside the sleeping bag compartment, but when it there the balance gets thrown off and pulls back in my collarbone quite a bit.  I tried packing it into the pack and it feels great that way, but doesn't leave be with enough room to fit either my bear canister or cooking system.

Just looking for some advice. Due to graduate school application cycles, I was not able to plan far enough ahead for the advance backcountry permits that were available through May so I must resort to walk-in permits. 

I have learned from my research that I need to arrive to the ranger station long before it opens if I hope to get my desired path and should have backup plans incase my ideal hike is not available. What I am concerned about, however, is whether or not I may obtain same-day permits or not. The website says that permits are given the day before the beginning of a hike, whereas I have seen several posts online during my research about hikers obtaining their permits day-of (i.e. obtaining their permit and immediately heading out on the hike). Essentially, I am not sure if this is a new change for this year or just a rule that is not necessarily strictly enforced. Due to travel coordination with others, that would be the most convenient option. I plan on calling the ranger center tomorrow anyway. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",backpacking,Walk-In Backcountry Permits for Grand Teton?,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/o0v5jr/walkin_backcountry_permits_for_grand_teton/
