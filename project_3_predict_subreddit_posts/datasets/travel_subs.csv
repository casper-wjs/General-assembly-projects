I'm going to Italy in October and need help deciding where to go my first day and a half there. I've been doing some research on my own but I would love the opinions of locals or people that have been to Italy before. 

My favorite thing about traveling is finding those hidden gems that aren't as well known, so I would like to do something that's less of a photo op, and more of a local experience.

Thanks so much for your help!

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm planning a trip to either Mexico or Costa Rica for roughly 4 weeks for October/November. But I'm not quite sure, if these destinations will be a good idea during that time of the year, since it is during the rain season and looking at the weather online it seems to rain a lot? 

So my first question is, will it be worth to travel to one of these countries during the rain season? 

&amp;#x200B;

If not, I'm open for any travel destination suggestions for that time period. My budget without flights is about 1500€ for 4 weeks.

One of my good friends lives in Oakland so I'm planning on visiting this fall along with a few other friends for a girls trip. We will be staying in Oakland majority of the time but plan on going up to Napa on Saturday morning, staying overnight and heading back Sunday. 

I have a few questions for you all and if there is any other advice that is also much appreciated! 

1. Transportation to and from Napa. We want to keep costs as low as possible so we can spend more on the wineries and activities. Has anyone ever taken public transit to Napa and what was your experience? Is renting a car to drive there worth it? 
2. Lodging in Napa. Again, trying to cut costs where we can! I'm thinking it would be cheaper to stay a little outside of Napa. Any recommendations for where to stay? It really doesn't have to be a fancy hotel, just somewhere to crash for the night. 
3. Ubers/Lyft in Napa. Is it possible to get Ubers so we can Uber from Napa to whatever hotel we are staying at? I'm trying to plan out how we will get everywhere but if there aren't going to be Ubers available then that really changes things.

THE BEST ADVICE IS APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. DO NOT CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY.

#American Passport Information 

## How to Apply

[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).

There will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents &amp; IDs you'll need, etc.

##Where to Apply

[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).

[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).

NOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. 


##Processing Times Within the US
As of September 2021, 

[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).

Normal processing is around 18 weeks.

Expedited processing is around 12 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)

Life or Death/ Urgent/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

NOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.

NOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel ""to the day"" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.

NOTE: It can take up to 4 weeks before your status changes to ""In Process"".

**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than 12 weeks BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**

#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US

### What is the status of my application?

Check here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/

### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?

No. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 4-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. 

Once they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.

### Can I get a same day passport.

Not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.

### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I don't have my passport/it's lost/it's expired/whatever, HELP WHAT DO I DO?

In all honesty you are pretty much SOL. [It is almost impossible to get the Urgent/Life or Death/Emergency in-person appointments](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html). For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link. If you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. 

Note that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.

Otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre-booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now-not-happening-trip. 

### My trip is within the next 12 weeks and I need a passport. HELP WHAT DO I DO?

There may be extremely limited appointments for Urgent non-emergency travel, [but this will need to be done at a Passport Agency which do not accept walk ins](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies.html). [And you can try to apply via this link](http://passportappointment.travel.state.gov/).

Note that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.  If you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. 


### My trip is in the next 12-18 weeks, what should I do?

I wouldn't bank on Expedited processing if your trip is 12 weeks away, instead go read above for other options.

If your trip is under 13-19 weeks away, I'd recommend doing the Expedited processing WITH Expedited Shipping, and at Week 10 contact your states House of Representatives to see if they can ensure your passport is moving along properly.

If you are traveling 13+ weeks out Expedited processing would be best.


### My trip is 19-21 weeks out.

I'd suggest normal processing BUT with expedited shipping. At week 17 if you don't see progress contact your State Representatives to see if they can ensure your passport is moving along properly.

### My trip is more than 21 weeks out.

Normal Processing should be fine, but again, if you haven't received anything 3 weeks out from your trip follow the above advice.


### Can I switch my application from Regular Processing to Expedited? 

Yes. Expedited service costs an additional $60. If you applied and have not received your passport, you may call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 and receive instructions on how request to expedite your passport. 

NOTE: It can take 20 days to fulfill this request.

NOTE: This is just a request, sometimes it cannot be honored. Regular Passports are processed at a different facility than Expedited ones. So they need to FIND your application paperwork in order to be able to switch the processing. 


### I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasn't changed/its been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website.

There may be a problem. Try contacting the State Department/Passport Office, or reach out to your state State Representatives. They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system.

### My ""Status"" on the website says ""Not Available""

It can take up to 4-6 weeks for your status to change to In-Progress.

### How do I find my State Representatives who can assist me?

[This link will help you for your State House Represenative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) or [you can also try your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm). Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf. Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling.

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving within 3 business days, get my passport, and then cancel the flight/Can I fake a family emergency? 

Yes, but given that those appointments are supposed to be those with life and death emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reason...so try not being a dick maybe?

### What about using a 3rd Party Rush/Expediting Service/Courier/Expeditor?

DO NOT USE THESE!!!

There is no magical service (other than contacting your state's house of representatives) that can get you your passport quicker than official channels. You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isn't guaranteed or possible. As well as there are many outright scam companies out there. I would not recommend you give them your personal information. [See the official government info here on why you should not use these](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html).

### I'm an American currently abroad and my passport recently expired. I need to quickly return to USA, can I travel on an expired passport?

[If you are overseas and your passport expired on or after January 1, 2020, you may be able to use your expired passport to return directly to the United States until December 31, 2021. Must be a direct flight and you must have the expired passport in your possession.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html)

## Other Questions

### Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book?

For air travel, the airline won't even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas. This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentation/visas. 

A passport card cannot be used for air travel.

### Can I travel internationally by land without a passport?

We frequently get questions on this especially for the USA/Mexico border. Officially no, you actually do need a passport. Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport.

### Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport?

We'd recommend hitting up /r/cruise as it may depend on your specific cruise. Some may not allow you on at all without a passport, others simply won't let you do shore excursions if you don't have a passport.

### I have dual citizenship, can I travel on my other passport instead?

While USA has no exit immigration, so you don't need to show your passport to exit, you are required to enter the USA on your American passport. You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport. So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an Embassy/Consulate before you return, get your American passport before you go.


### What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card?

Card is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry. Think Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Bermuda. You cannot use it for air travel.

If you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book.

### Since US Embassies are processing passports faster (less than 6 weeks), how can I send my application there to be processed?

You can't. Embassies only process passports for people in-person and in-country. 

Also, if your travel is soon and you are headed back to the US, you'll be given a limited-use Emergency Passport that can only be used to travel back to the US.

So the ""Why don't I just fly to Mexico on my soon to be expiring passport and apply at the embassy there?"" idea only works if you are in Mexico for 6+ weeks and if you have a current valid passport to even enter Mexico (or insert whatever other US Embassy you were asking about.)

### I've heard about ""6 Month Validity Rule"" what is it and what does it mean?

Some countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry (or exit). This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country. Some countries do not have this requirement, some require it to be 3 months, etc.

But the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early. And so its best to renew it before that time.


### I lost my passport, reported it lost, and now just found the original one, can I travel on it?

No. Once reported lost/stolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel. You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you don't accidentally bring it to the airport.


### I got part of my order but didn't get my old passport/new passport/passport card/my ID documents?!?

They'll come in separate shipments.


### I forgot my passport was in my maiden name/former name. Can I still use it for travel?

Your ticket must match your passport name. 

Note: There may be issues if your vaccine card/info is in a different name than the passport/ticketed name, but use the COVID Megathread for that question.

# ONE KEY RULE:

If you are answering any question with timing of how long it took you to get your passport you MUST state when this happened.

My daughter (15) and son (13) will be with me a week over fall break. I’m planning a road trip, actually a flight trip. They’ve never been on a airplane before. I know everyone feels differently but we are vaccinated masked and distance the best we can. I’d like advice or alternate recommendations. 


Current plan is fly Nashville to DC. Take in all the museums, monuments and tours. I’ve heard this is a really interesting trip w the bonus that most of the museums are free. 


Then fly Nash to Chicago. Besides driving through Atlanta, they’ve never experienced a big city up close. I thought some fancy dining, Field Museum, Science Museum, and local tours. - I’m not 100% sold on this part of the trip. 


Finally Nash to Vegas for a concert I think my daughter will go bananas for. 


If it was just me and my son I’d have no problem forming a plan. But I’m nervous my 15 yo daughter will not be happy. Really trying to reconnect w her after a nasty divorce.  I’m open to all destinations and adventures but she’s not really a “roughing it” kid. 😄

I'm studying abroad in Italy currently (in Tuscany), and have most of my weekends free to travel to other cities. I already have a relatively good idea of where to allot my time in Tuscany, but I'm having a hard time deciding which cities in Emilia Romagna, Veneto, and Lombardy I should prioritize for the weekends I want to spend up there. 

The only restriction I have for these side trips is them being on the weekend (Friday to Sunday, could possibly travel Thursday evening sometimes). All of the options I've been looking at are within 2 hours and 20 minutes from Florence, any longer than that would be a bit too long for me I think.

I'm really interested in both cultural and natural attractions, as well as architecture and history. I'm also interested in photography, but I know all the places I'm thinking about are quite photogenic. It also would be nice to avoid super large crowds, but there are some exceptions I would make for really special places (for example Venice).

I think it's also worth mentioning that this is my first time in Italy (and Europe in general), so it'd be nice to get some good variety and not miss the absolute musts (which I know are subjective but I like hearing different opinions on this).

Hello guys! First post in this group and first solo travel for me.

I am planning on doing a one week solo in the US. I'll be in New York for a wedding in October and afterwards I wanted to rent a car and go around a bit. I know I can't go too far as one week is not enough, but as I've already visited NYC multiple times I wanted to go somewhere more inland, see good scenery, and maybe stop in small towns every day to have a beer at a local pub. Do you have advices for an itinerary? 

At the moment I am considering states like Ohio, W Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. Not sure whether to just travel around these or choose one and explore. Budget is not a big issue. The idea would be to drive every day for 5-6 hrs max, either stopping along the way multiple times for sightseeing or doing the drive for 5hrs straight to get to the final destination for that day. 

My first idea just by looking at Google maps would be: 

Day 1) depart from NYC and head west toward the Monongahela national forest and the George Washington and Jefferson national forest. (Around 6h30 drive).

Day 2) head toward the Daniel Boone national forest (Around 5h30 drive). 

Day 3) Talladega national forest (6h30 drive).

Day 4-5-6) make my way back to NYC, possibly through another itinerary. 

As said I've never been in any of these places, so you can completely change the itinerary if you think there's something better to do!

As far as I’m aware the U.K. submitted the documentation to the EU  in order to obtain the mutual recognition status of the digital certificates in late July and this process should take from 6 to 8 weeks (based on the timeline for applications submitted by Switzerland, Turkey, Macedonia and Ukraine).

However, on 3 occasions, surprisingly my QR code was read by the system. I’m just wondering what does it depend on because I was really surprised that my QR code was recognised without any further inspection whilst at most places the staff couldn’t read it.


Therefore, my questions are: 1. Is now the NHS pass recognised or was it just a luck that my QR code was read in a few places? 2. Has anyone on this sub had any issues with their NHS passes in the EU?
3. Once both systems have been fully mutually recognised, would we have to show the QR code for the second dose or a domestic one (here is just one QR code).

So I'm headed to Manchester, England, in July '22 for a wedding (provided the pandemic doesn't stop me). After the wedding, I'd like to dip down into Europe. I posted a couple weeks back asking for very broad-strokes advice and I've averaged together people's insights and opinions into a general itinerary. 

The \*general\* thrust: Manchester &gt; London &gt; Amsterdam &gt; Paris &gt; southern France &gt; Barcelona / Costa Brava. The idea being that I'll start the trip in high-energy mode and get progressively more relaxed, culminating in beach-bumming.

Since I know nothing, I'm trying to narrow down where \*exactly\* to go, what \*exactly\* to do, and how \*exactly\* to get places. Particularly the latter part of the trip is quite sketchy.

Some pointed questions: how to get from Paris to the Mediterranean? I think I'd prefer to do this in such a way that I can see sights along the way as opposed to flying. And how to get into Spain in a maximally fun way? Where to stay in the Costa Brava region? I think I'd like to experience Barcelona, but it's not imperative that I stay there for all the nights listed, especially if there are cooler places around.

Beyond those pointed questions, I'm also just trying to hear some general pointers and/or be directed toward your favorite experiences in these areas. I so appreciate everyone's help! This is an amazing community.

Here's what I have sketched out so far:

**Fri 7/1** Arrive at Manchester airport. Go to wedding location.

I'm also connected to the public airport Wifi, and while it says wifi calling is enabled, the phone wont call Sprint support, 611, or any other number. It just hangs and disconnects.

I'm going to try online Sprint support chat with my phone I guess but just wanted to if this sub had any suggestions. I really can't have this happen in Athens as I have more connecting island flights and need to make calls.

We are limited in our options for where to stay because we are using a certificate for a 1-week stay that my parents got from a timeshare presentation.

That being said, I’ve narrowed down the options to the following in Benalmadena:

Sahara Sunset by Diamond Resorts

Royal Oasis @ Pueblo Quinta by Diamond Resorts

Couple of questions:

1. How is Benalmadena in December? I know it’s off-peak, but just hoping for the streets to not be completely deserted and for bars and restaurants to be open. Most of the other resort options were even further east, I am leaning towards Benalmadena for transit and proximity to Malaga…we could check out the Christmas lights, etc, looking for feedback on that idea.

2. Is there a particular week in December that would be best for activities and for restaurants to be open? Nothing big, with my parents the travel style is mainly walk around town, sightseeing, visit museums, window shopping, sit in cafe, sit on the beach, that type of stuff. Quiet but not too quiet would be great.

3. Should we 100% try to rent a car or can we work with taxis? Was trying to avoid renting, but most of the options seem to be a bit inconvenient via public transit. Overall I’m torn between two itinerary options: rent a car and try to make it out to Ronda, Nerja, maybe Granada, OR to just stick to the resort mostly and make do with trains/buses/cabs to Malaga and the closer towns. We wouldn’t mind sticking to the resort area most days if the resort is nice.

4. If anyone has any personal experience with the two resorts and can recommend either. If it’s going to end up being the type of trip where we stay in the resort, I’d like to pick the most comfortable one (most updated furnishings, best amenities, food, etc).

My questions to you are:  
1) I want to book in advance for the archaeological sites; what would be the proper website to do that?   
2) I read about free audio tours being available in the Google Playstore, do they still exist? Or is it better to spend like 10 euros to loan an audiotour on the site itself?  
3) I will be travelling from Sant'Agnello; what website can I best use for public transport? Can I also buy tickets in some kind of app?

* warm weather

**Bishkek**

* outdoor activities like hiking and horse riding tours
* cheap food
* less language barrier (I'm speaking a turkic language so more local interaction)

*CONs*

**Cancun**

* safety outside of Cancun/tourist area
* long boat trips are causing sea sickness (I have a travel sickness and tablets, but not sure how they work with sea sport while under effect)

**Bishkek**

* Outdoor activities are nice but expensive. Considering my stay for 2 weeks I can't afford to do alot stuff. You almost need a guided tour for travel outside the city. 1 day Tours start from €120+
* travel sickness. A horse ride never caused travel sickness but traveling for several hours in mountain areas with ups and downs will definitly do. My remedies will help but make me also dizzy. All activities are long hour rides
* takes more planning

So I had a flight scheduled for yesterday that I booked through Orbitz (yes, this will be my last time booking through them after seeing all of the stories). Yesterday morning, the itinerary suddenly stated that the flight was leaving three hours later than originally planned. I never received any notification of this. I wasn't able to check in online through Frontier (also probably the last time I'm ever going through them), and couldn't get in contact with anybody by phone or otherwise at Frontier, so I went to the airport at the original, three hours earlier, time, just to be safe.

Luckily, there was one flight that day that was going to my destination that was leaving in 30 minutes with AA, so we had to rush to get on it, and there was of course no time to communicate with airport staff or the airline. Up until last night, Orbitz was still saying that the flight existed and was leaving that night. 

My question is, should Orbitz compensate me anything for this wrong information? The two last second tickets came out to $700. I'm getting a refund for the $131 for the original tickets. I spoke to Orbitz several times last night, and each time, they initially stated that the flight was scheduled for last night, before putting me on hold, and then returning to confirm that it was canceled. I have confirmation emails and screenshots from yesterday morning showing a departure for last night. Orbitz keeps blaming Frontier, Frontier keeps blaming Orbitz.

Saturday:
- Arrive in CDG, take the RER to my hotel
- Drop off bags in hotel
- Get food
- Checkout the night view of the Eiffel Tower

Sunday:
- Walking tour (Sandemans)
- Wander around!
- Seine River cruise

Monday:
- 9 am Go up Eiffel Tower, Champs de Mars at 11 am
- Louvre in the afternoon
- Walk through the Tuileries gardens. Maybe quick stop to see Monet's Lillies in Orangerie?
- Angelina's afterwards
- Galeries Lafayette rooftop view
- Champs Elysees walk from Arc de Triomphe (go on top!)

Tuesday:
- Musée D'Orsay
- Open time (can do Marais, can do Montparnasse if I feel I need another viewpoint)
- Option for some nighttime tour if I want. Heard some great things about doing a deux cheveux tour. Otherwise just relax and take in the Parisian night

Wednesday:
- Versailles. Haven't planned this out yet, but I think most important thing is knowing the general gist of things.

Thursday:
- I think I'm going to rent a car and stay in Colmar. So TBD tomorrow but gonna book a hotel in Colmar just in case.

Friday:
- Colmar (road trip somewhere)
Saturday:
- Colmar

Sunday:
- Colmar and Return to Paris in the evening.
I will admit I haven't fully researched what to do in Alsace (besides Strasbourg + Colmar + Wine route), so in this critique focus on Paris. I will make another thread for what to do in Alsace.

Monday:
- Honestly not much. Do whatever I missed. This is a no plan day. Most likely Montmatre + Sacre Couer to finish the list of places I wanted to see :)

We got a great deal with flights to Zurich which is why it's such a short time. So we will have one full day to explore somewhere via Zurich. Lucerne is on our list of course since it's a popular destination and fairly close, but we want to consider our options. If it ends up being a clear day, we love the idea of being able to see any tall mountains. Not go up in them - we're not hikers and we know most mountain activities are closed in April, but just to be able to get any nice views if it's clear. Is there a good location that would give us good views via public transportation from Zurich and not super far away?

The Netherlands is one of the most beautiful countries you will ever visit. And hands down, most of its beauty lies in Amsterdam. Your visit as a tourist or as a resident, the beauty of the place never fails to make you spellbound. There are so many places you can visit while you are there. But carrying your luggage around while you look around and see the areas is not that fun. Therefore, there are [Amsterdam storage lockers](https://vertoe.com/luggage-storage/amsterdam) that will help you with your bags and valuables. But before we talk about luggage, let's look at some of the places you can visit while you are in Amsterdam.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bhf0s435r9n71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9422a3324f7b9f51a7f8c8fbb2551e4c4df602cb

**Arty Jordan**

Did you ever wonder what it would be like to step back in time? Walking along the charmed streets of Jordan will give you the same experience. The narrow streets are full of art galleries, gardens, restaurants, and many more.

**Hidden gems**

When you are in Amsterdam, you will have to visit the street that takes you to the hidden gems, in a metaphorical sense. You can cycle along the road and see the beauty. With over eight hundred thousand bikes, people in Amsterdam are hands down bike riders. And the count is more than motorcycles.

**The countryside Windmills**

One of the best tourist attractions of Amsterdam is the windmills and the beaches. They are a beauty within themselves. The landscape is full of windmills. You can see cafes situated between two of them. The beaches are an art of nature.

**Westergas Culture**

Amsterdam has a different cultural background. Its ancient history is fascinating. The Westergas was once full of factories, but today people rebuilt it into a colorful and charming locality with multiple bars, cafes, restaurants, and offices in the way. It is an art of creativity. The art-house cinemas on the street are not just sophisticated but also a treat to the eye.

**Canal Houses and Bridges**

The bridges of Amsterdam are other tourist attractions. The design is so ancient, and the architecture is so intricate. You can travel through the bridges or also along with the water bodies in a boat. A professional guide will be with you all the time, informing you about the culture and heritage of the place. The canal cruise is indeed a treat to experience. You can even, at times, snatch a free ride through the canal.

So, as you saw, there are many places that you can visit in Amsterdam, but walking around carrying heavy backs will harsh your mellow. And most importantly, if you plan to ride a bicycle, there is no way you can have all your bags. So instead of taking them with you, you can store them in the Amsterdam storage lockers. These lockers are safe and secure. They collect money on an hourly basis, and you can keep them nearer to the train station. In that case, if you plan to head back onto the train for your next trip, you can collect your luggage and be on your way.",travel,A Little About Amsterdam and the Tourist storage lockers,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pnezq3/a_little_about_amsterdam_and_the_tourist_storage/

Thanks to a precious post on here, I’ve decided to spend my 10 day trip to Europe in May all in Italy, but looking for some recommendations!!

I’ll be in positano for 3 full days for a wedding, then looking to go somewhere else before ending with 2 days or so in Rome before flying out. 

I’ve been to Rome, Florence and 3 times before (venice 2x) but I’ll be traveling with my boyfriend who’s never been to Italy. 

I’m interested in checking out more of southern Italy (Polignano A Mare/Puglia), or somewhere in Tuscany for wineries and relaxing in beautiful scenery (preferably not Florence as I’ve been there a few times before). 

Definitely won’t have time to do both as I’ll have 4 days for whatever I can fit in between Positano and Rome. 

Things I’m considering:

- Travel to/from Puglia isn’t easy
- Will Puglia be too similar to Amalfi? Boyfriends first time inItaly so I want to make sure he gets a good variety! 

- Where to go in Tuscany besides Florence? Or should we just stay in Florence and do a day trip to a vineyard or small town? 
- Easy to travel back to Rome from Florence
-Scenery might be a nice contrast to amalfi coast 

-Lake Como too far? We could do positano-&gt;Rome-&gt; lake como then fly back from Milan 

- Would love to spend more time in Amalfi but hotel prices are killer 🥲 our budget is reasonable (out of the backpacking/hostel phase, so we’ll be staying in Airbnb’s and reasonably priced hotels)

Hello, my friend and I are planning to drive soon to Quebec, Canada from New York State in the US for a touristic visit. We are fully vaccinated and I'm aware we will have to show a negative test at the Canadian border taken within 72h. However, I have some questions related to this trip and I would appreciate if you could help me answering some of them, especially if you have been driving to Canada from the US recently:

\- If we drive to Canada and drive back to the US, do we need another negative test to re-enter the US? My understanding is that we don't need a test to re-enter the US if we drive, only if we fly, but I could be wrong.

\- How strict are the sanitary restrictions in Canada? We are planning to visit Quebec and besides enjoy our stay at restaurants, hotels, bars or other public places open for tourists there but we are concerned with how strict the sanitary rules are there. Will we have to wear a mask all the time, outside and inside? In restaurants too? Will it even be possible to enter in restaurants/bars? 

\- Finally, is now really the best time to visit Quebec/Montreal? The recent Canadian border opening to fully vaccinated Americans encouraged us to plan this short trip but now, we are having second thoughts of how practical and enjoyable our trip would be if the sanitary restrictions are too drastic. Should we postpone our trip?

The first three cities on that list, I can say many amazing things about. 

Vienna was the most liveable city I've ever been to, I loved the history, the food, the space, the gardens, everything. 

Budapest was one of the most fun places I've ever been. The ruin bars and nightlife were just wild. The city has character. The castle district, the thermal baths, the architecture all blew me away.

Bratislava, despite being small, had charm and was a nice place to spend a relaxing day or two.

Prague on the other hand feels extremely underwhelming. It just feels like a standard European city with no particular character. The nightlife doesn't beat Budapest, the beauty of the city doesn't even come in my European top 20, the people are cold and it's not just that there are too many tourists, but they're really boring type of tourists as well.

I have planned the route out according to our mutual interests but I was wondering if someone had some advice on certain points or maybe ideas for places we shouldn’t miss. We’re the kind of travellers that enjoy passing through as much as hotspots as possible. We did several trips already with a fully loaded schedule, but always well planned so that we get to see everything in a short amount of time. And yes, people have called us crazy more then once haha.  So in general, this is our itinerary:

Day 1: Amsterdam - Seattle (by plane). We want to visit the Hoh Rain Forest and the Boeing Museum.
Day 4: Seattle - Portland (with rental car all the way to Las Vegas). We thought that the Multnomah Falls and the Japanese Gardens would be cool to visit. 
Day 7: Portland - San Francisco where we would want to check out downtown, the Golden Gate and Alcatraz
Day 10: San Francisco - Los Angeles where we’d have a full beach day and visits to Hollywood (and the sign ofc haha) and Beverly Hills
Day 14: Los Angeles - Las Vegas. Here we’d like to visit the strip ofcourse. But as we’re both not the gambling type of persons we wouldn’t want to stay for more than a night or two. 
Day 16: Las Vegas - Santa Fe. In LV, we’d like to rent a RV and make a pitstop to slee in Santa Fe. We’d like to pass the Hoover Dam and visit The Grand Canyon.
Day 17: Santa Fe - Oklahoma City. This would be a driving day and the drop off for the RV. Maybe someone knows cool spots somewhere in between where we could stay or visit? Or maybe cool things in Oklahoma?
Day 18: Oklahoma City - St Louis (by plane). As we’re both Bosnians, we cant visit the USA without visiting St. Louis lol.
Day 19: St. Louis - Chicago (by rental car all the way to Washington DC). If someone has tips on nice scenic routes or hotspots on the road, please share! In Chicago we’d like to do a River cruise, check the Magnificent Mile, the famous Willis Tower and the Skydeck. 
Day 22: Chicago - DuBois. This would be a driving day where we’d make a pitstop in DuBois.
Day 23: DuBois - New York City: 	I’m a huge fan of the Big Apple. So I’d like to go all out here. This means Greenwich Village, The Vessel, North 5th Pier, Rockefeller, Central Park ofcourse and the Empire State, Ground Zero, Grand Central Station, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, SoHo, the Waldorf Astoria (only from the outside lol)
Day 29: New York City - Washington DC. Hellooo Joe Biden! We’d go visit the White House, The Capitol, Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian. 
Day 32: Washington DC - New Orleans (by plane). We’d go visit the French Quarter, Garden District, Oak Alley and we were recommended to do the Ghost Tour.
Day 35: New Orleans - Orlando (with rental car all the way to Miami). Orlando is all about Universal Studios and Disney World for us haha. We’d stay in the Portofino one as we think he has the best scenery!
Day 39: Orlando- Miami. Our trio would end in Miami. I don’t know what are cool places to visit but we’d stay maybe 3-4 days and enjoy sunny days on Miami Beach.

So we're traveling to Cancun in December and we are definitely splurging a little bit of money on this one, but my wife is a bit concerned about something happening and us not being able to go on this trip, and losing all our money.

-Sea or Lake for Swimming nearby, especially during the summer months.

-Child friendly area with good or at least okay medical care just in case.

I am yet again asking for your advice on where to go to in november and dezember. I´ll probably cross-post to r/solotravel and whatever subs you can recommend for my question. 

**Backstory:**

I need to get out before another 4 years of the daily grind because I will graduate my masters next month and then start another project in January. Thus, I was thinking to go to latin america once again. Love the nature, love the people, love the vibes.

So far, I have been to various countries such as guatemala, costa rica, nicaragua, ecuador, panama and colombia. My english and spanish skills are both around the C1-B2 level so I am not too concerned about that barrier. I am 24 (M) and vaccinated. 

**Idea:**

Anyhow, my first thought was to go back to colombia and do the south + north of ecuador in a period of 4-6 weeks. I like to take my time and find a balance of doing things while making room for relaxation. Just a few days ago someone recommended uruguy to me and I was hoping someone could give me some input on that country because it looks very nice and (kinda) checks all the boxes. 

These boxes are: 

\- not too big (don´t want to waste too much time in the bus except night buses, these are fine)

\- not too expensive (still a student)

\- should be more or less ""stable"" in terms of riots and such (not a big fan of police clashes)

\- good people, good vibes and most importantly good hostel culture (i like to talk and meet people)

\- great nature including beaches (want to surf for 1-2 weeks)

\- ?

Unfortunately, I am still unsure where to go and how long to stay but fear I have to make a decision soon unless I want to pay horrendous prices. Feel free to give me as much input as you´d like and I am happy to chat about whatever experiences you want to share! And no, I am not keen on going to Asia because for some reason a friend of mine and I decided to go in 4 years and then commit 6 months or so for that, so latin america it is for now.

We like the idea because there are activities every day and it goes to the Black Forest which looks stunning but the cruise is right at the top of our budget. We don't really fancy all of the additional afternoon trips (which cost extra) so there will be some afternoons we'll be entertaining ourselves. 

We are 25F and 26M. We aren't big party people and do like going out and seeing things - castles, museums, architecture, nature stuff. We like the idea of being on the boat and being somewhere new everyday. Neither of us have done anything like this before though so we wondered if anyone has any experience of these sort of cruises?

Specifically:
What sort of age are these cruises aimed at? My parents' friend has been and warned us we will probably be the only youngish people on board.
If we don't do the extra afternoon trips is it easy to get around the towns etc that we're docked at to entertain ourselves?

We wanted to do something really special since its a honeymoon. Our other idea is Croatia for a week, all inclusive and going on several of the hotel-run trips and chilling in Dubrovnik.

I'm posting because I'm desperate for input on my situation. If there's somewhere else I can post as well please let me know because I'd like as much input as I can possibly get.

My girlfriend (USA) is flying to be with me (UK) next month and is bringing her cat Dolce. He is very attached to her so we want him to be with us when she moves over here. We have checked all the entry requirements with the UK govt website and we are going to fly with Air France (AF). Our planned travel route is Jacksonville, FL to JFK airport, New York and then from there to Manchester, England.

I called AF for further clarification on their pet policy but I don't think the lady understood their own policy. She said to contact the cargo team at Martin Air which is the cargo carrier for AF and KLM but I don't think this was the right information. I tried to call back AF but they were closed when I did.

Basically - does anyone know how this works with AF and their pet policy. Will the cat have to travel in the hold on the first flight from Jacksonville to New York? And will she have to recheck him at New York for entry into Manchester England? Will the 400 euro fee cover his travel on both flights?

Since doing it online wasn't possible I called Expedia customer care. While doing the rescheduling my card was declined and shortly after that the call got disconnected coz I ran out of balance.

I thought that since the payment didn't happen, I would just stick with the original date and didn't call back. However, 2-3 hours later I find that my booking was cancelled on Expedia. I tried to check Turkish airlines and my booking also disappeared over there. Later I got a cancellation email too.

I immediately called Expedia and after a lot of tries I finally managed to connect to a customer support agent. I explained the issue to him and he looked into it. He told me that since the payment didn't happen, after some time, Turkish Airlines deleted my flight. However, as the credit is there, he can rebook the flight for me. And he did that. 

Now the issue is that after he booked my flight he sent me an itinerary from Tripcase instead of Expedia and said that I would get the official confirmation from Expedia in 24 hours. The tripcase itinerary contained the PNR number and the 13 digit ticket number etc. I tried checking Turkish Airlines using both numbers and my booking showed over there.

During this time a customer service guy also got in touch with me over email. I asked him for the official itinerary but he sent me the Tripcase itinerary and the Turkish Airlines website booking despite me clearly explaining to him that I want the Expedia itinerary and that my booking is not showing on Expedia. After that he didn't reply.

Today I decided to call Expedia Malaysia customer care since that is where I booked the flight from. And the cutomer service agent, after a long try of finding and fixing the issue told me to call Expedia Malaysia and that she was speaking from Expedia US (accent did seem American though).

I also speak a little bit of Spanish. I've got a really good friend and other fellow solo traveler who lives and teaches grade school in Cuenca I will be meeting up with part way of the trip.


Here's the rough itinerary so far:


OCT 26: 
Arrive to Quito in the evening, spend 2 days exploring the city.

OCT 29: Meet with my friend and arrive to Either Banos or Tena (or another spot in the rainforest) I've heard Banos is a must. So I'm leaning towards that. This is the part of the trip that is most fluid. Recomendations on what to see in the Central highlands would be great. I've heard the Quilotoa Loop and Cotopaxi is cool but not sure if we have the time for that. Tena is supposed to be off the beaten path and a cool spot to get deeper into the jungle. 

NOV 8ish: Arrive in Cuenca spend 3-5 days there with my friend. 

NOV 12: Fly back to Quito in the evening and back to the states. 

So I guess filling in the middle portion of the trip is the biggest question mark. We have 9 days. Right now Banos, Tena and, Cotopaxi are what we are leaning towards to going to, but we are still in the beginning stages of planning.

My wife and I (and our two kids) are planning on driving around the US for 6 months in about two years from now. I have a general idea of what our route could be, but I'd love to hear other travellers or just about anyone in general, for any new ideas, places to see, places to perhaps avoid, etc.

A few bullet points:

- We are canadians so we can at most stay on american soil for a period of six months on a tourist visa
- We would be travelling in Canada first, from the eastern side of canada to BC. Our potential entry point to the continental US would be near Vancouver.
- We are planning on potentially entering the US in late September or early October. We are planning our trip around the weather, and the school year. We'd probably be travelling in Canada in July/Augusut/September too, then go to the US. That means we would be driving back home in early April or so
- We are definitely not against a quick detour in Mexico, somewhere not to far from the border
- We would try to avoid coming across too much snow. That being said, I think we'd love a bit of skiing in Colorado or something similar, but I don't know how much cold our RV can take with us sleeping in it.
- It's mostly an outdoor experience we're going for, hiking, seeing the ocean, etc. But we'll certainly be visiting cities too, but that's less of our goal here
- We are not planning on spending much time than necessary in New England (we've traveled around there plenty already), but everything else is fair game.

Ok so with all of that said, my rough Idea is to drive down the pacific states, perhaps with some detours in Montana or Idaho where there's some good hiking going on, all the way to the bottom on the US pacific coast, then spend some time in AZ, UT, CO and NM, then sort of keep to the lower part of the US, across TX, LA, MI, AL, drive down and up FL, then up the east coast.

That means missing out on the whole midwest, but that's because I assume it will get pretty cold over there in winter, which we would try to avoid.

Is that realistic? is it even a good idea? I imagine that ideally we'd do our trip from perhaps May to October, but that's not really what we are working with here...

Heading to Mexico on Oct 2nd! It will be my 3rd time travelling there; the first time I did CDMX and Oaxaca, the second time I did CDMX and Chiapas. Both were 2 week trips. This time, I'm going for 3 weeks, and looking to explore and learn more new places, but unsure if my itinerary is too packed. Interests are exploring cities, visiting ancient sites, learning about culture and history, and eating all the local foods. Planning to go to cenotes but not interested in beaches. Are there any places in my itinerary that you'd remove? 

Day 1-3: CDMX (Been here before but there are still places I would like to visit).

Day 4: San Miguel De Allende

Day 5-7: Guanajuato

Day 8-11: Guadalajara

Fly from Guadalajara to Yucatan; arrive in Cancun and head to Tulum

Day 12-14: Tulum

Day 15-16: Valladolid

Day 17: Merida

Fly from Merida to Oaxaca

Day 18-20: Oaxaca (Have also been here once before, but will be with my girlfriend who hasn't seen it yet)

Day 21-23: Puebla

How does this look? Is it too many places in too little time? We will be transiting between cities on buses, and looking at renting a car when we arrive in Cancun..

https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pj1mpa/company_said_were_going_back_to_the_office_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Background:

I’m a 24 y/o single male from a large southern US city. Worked corporate finance remote (1st job). Company said we’re going back to the office in September, and I said “Nah I’m going to Europe.”

I’m starting at Columbia Business School next year, so I’m treating this like a gap year now. Sold my car for $27k, found someone to sublease my crib, and I flew to Barcelona. Been to Barcelona, Prague, and Budapest so far.

Met a couple of Americans in Barcelona, and we’ve been traveling together. If you’re young, do hostels. You will meet some incredible people.

On Prague specifically:

BARS:

Open til 5 AM. No real restrictions. Duplex was a really fun night club. There is a 5 story night club on the river that’s usually popping on weekends, but we were there M-Th so we skipped that.

Tons of good pubs. We wanted football (soccer) at the Irish Times in Old town.

The ice bar was a blast. Completely frozen bar with cool music.

Anonymous is a “V for Vendetta” themed bar where everyone has Guy Fawkes masks. Check it out. Super groovy

Honestly there’s hundreds of bars and clubs around town that are fun, depending on your taste. The whole area between two metro stops (Mustek and Staromestska) is popping. Just walk around there.

SITES:

Prague Castle is an incredible view of the city, and the compound itself is impressive. Go at sunset and get dinner near the top of the hill at the restaurant on the ledge.

St. Charles Bridge is beautiful.

Go in the Astrological Clock Tower. Middle of downtown and has a cool view of the city, plus it’s historic.

Vysehrad is the original city, and it has a phenomenal view of the river.

Lodging:

Hostels are dirt cheap. Hostel One Miru was perfect for us. Cheap, next to metro, great accommodations, staff was 10/10.

RANDOM STUFF:

Get a metro pass, don’t use an expired one. You may get fined.

It’s pretty safe, but stay aware of your surroundings at night.

Trams run 24/7, metro closes at midnight.

Drinks and food are cheap.

Find a coffeeshop by the river. I write online a lot, and I loved the environment.

This is my first trip abroad. I went on a trip with 4 friends to London, and it was honestly the worst trip ever. Friend 1 was so cheap you and only wanted to do free sightseeing as well as eat from Subway or McDonald's. Friend 2 has a small bank so her card didn't work the whole time and I ended up paying for all her stuff. She paid me back, but I just felt bad for charging her for little stuf I paid for (e.g. appetizers, or a few dollars items, as well as short uber rides). I grew up from a giving community, so I didn't mind it. However, after all my calculations, I sort of regret it. She also woke up so late - around 1 or 2pm. For the first few days, I was so frustrated that we had to wait for her since she is the main social butterfly. I got so angry, so I just leave in the morning by myself. Leaving everyone early brought a tension, and they all thought I was being neglectful. Friend 3 (who I am not close to but is the friend of 2) didn't even have money. He only paid for the flight and lodge, but he didn't have money for anything else. I felt bad and helped pay for most of his stuff because I didn't want him to be stuck in the AirBnB we all share. Of course, it added up and I lost so much money. Friend 4 (She stayed in her own hotel and is the friend of 2 so I'm not that close to her) is so slow with walking and always ended talking with random strangers on the streets so we couldn't do much. We wasted so much time waiting for her.

Flying from CLT to JFK on 9/23 departing at 8:30p and arriving at 10:20p via JetBlue operated by AA (lands in terminal 8).  checking 1-2 bags.  On 9/24, we leave at 7a for Grenada via JetBlue (departs from terminal 5).

Figured we probably wont get our bags in hand until 11-11:30 barring any delays.  We’ll have to be back at Terminal 5 to check bags and clear security at 4a.  We booked two separate flights, not one continuous itinerary.

Currently leaning towards the TWA Hotel since it’s on site and directly across from our departing terminal.  Leaning against roughing it landside for a few hours and catching whatever rest we can with at least some sort of comfort.

Is the TWA Hotel worth ~$300 for what will essentially be 3-4 hours of rest?

I do not want either of these locks to be TSA locks as I will be carrying my bag on and am solely relying on these for security. 
Most of the suggestions I’ve seen from articles are flimsy and seem like they’d be easy to bypass with force or pick. I know the small zipper locks are a deterrent rather than being very secure anyway but I’d still prefer something that won’t be opened with a tsa key.

The reasons why people love to travel are varied and very personal. There are some countries/places in the minds of everyone who want to go at least once in their life. Leave a comment in this thread about the three countries and the reasons you want to go to like that. 

For me,

1. India- I want to experience the cultural and geographical changes from south to north and east to west when you move each 250-500 miles.

2. Brazil-  A dreamboat trip through serene Amazon rain forest and want to be a part of Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, one of the biggest carnival in the world.

3. Central Asia- especially to drive through the most adventurous and remote Pamir highway.

- lots of nature and preferably some hills and lakes (or sea) 

- not so big that it is absolutely busy and chaotic but also not so small that only old people live there

- some culture (museums, theatres) 

- some kind of underground scene, especially for dark electronic music, illegal raves, etc.

- has a magical feel to it (could be because of some old myths, ruins, rich history, natural phenomena or anything like that) 

- nice architecture 

- organic and vegan restaurants and grocery stores 

- has a very classy, sophisticated and clean vibe

Expedia didn't ask for passport information like number and stuff. Is this normal?

I booked for 4 passengers on a Lufthansa flight and in my email I only received one booking code. Can I use this 1 booking code to check-in all 4 of us or is there some hidden code or something I'm missing in the emails somewhere? Also, Lufthansa is telling me I can only check-in 23 hours before the flight.

I’m not in this for fun or just to prepare for some 3-day trip, I actually want to be really f****** good  at all 3 languages. I’ve decided to dedicate my life to this labour (sounds cult-like, I know, but I really feel a strong sense of passion for what I’m doing) (that is, I don’t aspire to be the idiots who claim to speak 20 languages but can only utter a few simple words and phrases). And after that, maybe I’ll learn a couple more- French or Russian perhaps?

It’s not that I’m terrible at them: for Spanish, I’ve reached a pretty good level- for those who know the CEFR scale, it’s around the C1 level, while for Italian and Portuguese, I do have an intermediate level when it comes to writing and listening and reading comprehension, but I struggle with speaking at times. 

However, I feel a little (actually, very) FOMO because I’m not learning French I’ve explored a little French culture (I love the few songs I’ve listened to). I don’t care that everyone is learning French apart from me- that’s besides the point. For me, the interest is there- just that, in the quest to be near-perfect in all 3 of my current languages, it’s difficult to fit in another language (imagine remembering 20+ words from 4 languages everyday+ media immersion). This is not a question of goals either (I am learning languages for the sole purpose of learning the language- anything else is a result of that).

The Francophone world also seems so huge- I’m missing out on so much culture, media, literature. It sucks. I thumbed through Le Figaro (France’s national newspaper) and I see all this content that I’m never going to be able to access.

My routine (so you understand why I feel this way- it’s hard to squeeze in another language this way, isn’t it? ): I go all-out to study and try my very best at all 3 languages. I read multiple newspapers from 4-5 different countries EVERYDAY, listen to podcasts in each language, write at least a 200-word essay EVERY SINGLE DAY ( in BOTH Italian and Portuguese, the weaker languages), and try to squeeze in a couple of hours of speaking practise, if time and energy level permits. I’ve essentially transformed my routine into one reminiscent of a military base/camp, no frills with a lot of drills- at least for now.

*I don’t learn languages to stop halfway- that is to say, I’m not willing to learn any language just to learn basic phrases, words and grammar- If I’m learning, I’m learning all the way and for life. 

** If you say- why not just watch X movie with subs or read X book in English- my response is: I treat this like a game- that is to say, everything is locked and I can’t access it until I LEARN the language. Besides, dubbing and subs and translations suck.

I am seeking help finding a destination for a 3-4 day girls weekend in the US. The purpose of the trip to reunite after missing several years together. We are all vaccinated, have all had babies since we have seen each last, and are seeking a short getaway to catch up, drink wine, and have fun. Would love to hear your input! 

NEEDS: nonstop flight under 5 hours (flying from SeaTac and MKE airports), lodging with a refrigerator (medical liquid)

WANTS: food and wine destination, unique/interesting lodging option, entertainment, Uber friendly 

AVOID: beach focused (don’t want to pack a swimsuit), hard to access (need to be able to keep medical liquid at temperature)

We’ve already vacationed together in LA, Vegas, Chicago and New Orleans so we don’t want to repeat this time. Many New England destinations are a far flight from SeaTac.

Monday would be a walking tour (Rick Steves Paris tour), Seine cruise, Galeries Lafayette rooftop view.

Tuesday would be Louvre + Champs-Elysees, maybe Orangerie museum, and dinner on the ile st louis.

Friday would be the eiffel tower, place du Trocadero

Saturday would be Bruges, spend the night in Ghent

I posted on r/southafrica about our upcoming itinerary, and I got some super helpful feedback, but also a lot mixed reviews on doing the Wild Coast route as a tourist. I thought I'd be worth coming here to see if any of y'all seasoned travelers might have some advice about safety/where to stay/etc for this portion of our trip. Here's our loose itinerary, and we've got about 8 nights to get from Hermanus to Durban, where we'll be staying one night before proceeding to the Drakensberg mountain for 3 nights: 

* Hermanus--overnight with early morning shark cage diving in Gansbaai if the weather permits
* Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, overnight in Oudtshoorn--see ostrich farm, Cango caves
* Oudtshoorn to Garden Route for 3 nights--we're thinking one night in Knynsa, one night in Stormsriver, and one night in or around Port Elizabeth? We're interested in Robberg, Tsitsikamma, and probably Addo
* Port Elizabeth to Wild Coast for 3 nights--perhaps one night in Chintsa, one night in Coffee Bay, and one night at the Umngazi Bungalows south of Port St Johns; **this is the part of the trip that concerns me based on feedback from the locals; we've got an SUV and we know the roads are full of potholes and wildlife, but will we otherwise unsafe or in over our heads? We would not drive at night, and we don't want too long drives between cities so that we can make sure to avoid that, but we also want to be progressing up to coast towards Durban**
* Umngazi to Durban, overnight in Durban--likely stay in the Uhmlanga area, per advice of r/southafraica

For anyone that has done this route, I'd appreciate all input you might have about driving through here as a foreigner! We are not strangers to driving on the left side of the road, and we're from Texas and Wisconsin so long distances/less than ideal conditions are not overly a concern!

Unfortunately, I'm away in Germany during that time so I can't take the company up on this offer, but it left me wondering whether the sort of fares that I saw were 'normal'? Was it just a bad ship/unpopular route, or was it something like an airline error fare where I just saw a wrongly-inputted price? It just feels slightly too good to be true, and I was worrying that if you were to proceed with a payment the price would skyrocket.

Accordingly, /r/travel is continuing its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates.

In the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**

## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?

A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm). Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).

You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**

## ...in the US?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals (regardless of vaccination status)* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in *or transited* via Brazil, China, India, Iran, Ireland, the Schengen Area, South Africa, or the UK in the preceding 14 days. Exceptions to this rule include green card holders, some family members of US citizens and permanent residents, and holders of certain visas (e.g. F-1 visas under certain circumstances, and K-1 visas). *Note that (except for, of course, US citizens) this is not a citizenship-based restriction; it is purely based on travel history.* **Because of this, those traveling from one of the restricted countries are permitted to enter the US provided they spend two weeks prior to arrival in the US in a non-restricted country.** More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the [US CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html).

**All air passengers – regardless of origin, nationality, and vaccination status – [need to produce a negative result](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html)** from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US. Alternatively, you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that you're clear for travel. The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes, but [air, rail, and sea (but not commuter rail or ferry) ports-of-entry remain open](https://ca.usembassy.gov/travel-restrictions-fact-sheet/) to non-essential travel.

**No nationwide quarantine requirements exist.** Some individual states and/or cities may have their own recommendations, but, outside Hawaii, these are just recommendations. **COVID tests are not being demanded at check-in, security, boarding, or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States, and checkpoints are not being set up at state borders.** Hawaii is the only state with strict testing and quarantine requirements of domestic travel.

For more information, see [the US CDC's COVID-19 page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).

## ...in Canada?

At the time of writing, most *foreign nationals* are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain, mostly essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*. Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions. Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for non-essential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents. Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Fully airside international transits are typically permitted.

Since Aug. 9, fully vaccinated Americans and US permanent residents traveling from the US will be permitted to enter Canada for non-essential reasons. Border restrictions are expected to be loosened for fully vaccinated travelers for other countries starting Sep. 7.

All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to [produce a negative result from a PCR test](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying) taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada. Alternatively, you may submit a positive COVID-19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure.

Travelers may be required to take a test upon arrival and then must self-quarantine until 14 days after arrival, during which they must take another test (on Day 8). As of Jul. 5, those already eligible to enter Canada may qualify for an [exemption to quarantine](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada) and an exemption from the Day 8 test, if they have been fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival.

For more information, see [the Canadian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.html).

## ...in Mexico?

At the time of writing, there are no changes to Mexico's standard entry requirements. However, the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes. Travelers must fill out a ""Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers"" to present upon arrival. There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico.

For more information, see information provided by Mexican embassies, including the [Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/paisesbajos/index.php/foreign-nationals/frequent-questions).

## ...in the UK?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited one of the [counties on the ""red list""](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#red-list) within the previous 10 days. This list is subject to change. Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are, in addition to UK nationals, exempted from this restriction.

**All passengers entering [or transiting](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/layovers-and-transiting) through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area (which comprises the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands) need to produce a negative PCR, LAMP, or antigen test taken within 3 days of their last direct flight (or other mode of transit) to the UK**. Those who have only been/transited in [""green list"" countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#green-list) in the previous ten days are not required to quarantine, although they must still take a COVID-19 test the second day after arrival. In England, people that have only been/transited in [""amber list"" countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#amber-list) who have been **fully vaccinated under the UK programme or in the EU, US, or Switzerland**, are [also not required to quarantine](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england#rules-if-youre-fully-vaccinated), although they must still take a COVID-19 test the second day after arrival. *The restriction is based on travel history, not nationality.*

All other international arrivals (including UK citizens) will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival and take a COVID-19 test on the second and eighth days after arrival. Passengers who have not been/transited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they [test negative](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel) at least 5 days into their quarantine period. In England, passengers are also [permitted to leave quarantine to depart the country](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england#quarantine-for-10-days-after-you-arrive).

Unless falling under the ""green list"" exemption, all travelers, regardless of nationality, coming from outside the Common Travel Area will, in addition to getting tested before departure, need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival. These tests need to be [pre-booked before departure](https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/). 

All travelers that have been/transited in any of the ""red list"" countries over the previous ten days must book, at their own expense, a hotel room for their quarantine. For those destined for Scotland, *all travelers* who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines. These hotel rooms must be [booked in advance](https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/), along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine.

With ""lockdown"" measures in place within the UK, there may be restrictions on travel purposes to, from, or within the constituent countries. For example, [travel to and from Scotland is prohibited](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-travel-and-transport/) except for limited purposes.

For more information, see [UK Border Control](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control) and the [UK government's information about travel measures](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19).

## ...in the EU? In the Schengen Area?

In late June 2020, the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to short-term visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus. **This [list of countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en), however, is non-binding among member countries and is subject to change.** The European Commission generally reviews its list every two weeks.

Nevertheless, several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance, permitting arrivals from these countries as well as ""EU+"" countries (which includes EU and Schengen countries, and sometimes the UK). These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history and/or residency; consult resources from your destination country. However, multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries (e.g. the UK) or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU, the Schengen Area, or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants. Fully airside non-Schengen to non-Schengen transits are typically permitted, but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation (which may, at times, include negative test results) is required. For  example, **Germany's transit requirements** are discussed [here](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/travel-restrictions-border-control/travel-restriction-border-control-list.html#f14745744) and
[here](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268#content_5).

In May 2021, the European Commission recommended EU states loosen travel restrictions, including by allowing vaccinated travelers to travel to Europe. However, once again, each EU country has the ultimate say on its border policies. **Among the European countries that have reopened to vaccinated travelers are [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coronavirus-advice-for-foreign-nationals-in-france/#sommaire_1), [Greece](https://travel.gov.gr/#/), [Iceland](https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/greinar/grein/item44162/Certificate-of-vaccinat.ion-against-COVID-19-accepted-at-the-border), and [Spain](https://twitter.com/SpainInTheUSA/status/1401155037297090564).** This list is not exhaustive, and some countries are also loosening some restrictions for unvaccinated tourists.

As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to third-country nationals in various ways and with different exceptions, it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their ports-of-entry. A summary of travel restrictions is [provided by the European Union](https://reopen.europa.eu/en), but many have reported that government (e.g. embassy or foreign ministry) resources have been more detailed and accurate.

## ...in South Korea?

At the time of writing, [most nationalities](http://viewer.moj.go.kr/skin/doc.html?rs=/result/bbs/229&amp;fn=temp_1586503947805100) with visa-free or visa-waiver arrangements with Korea have had their visa-free/waiver status suspended, primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens. There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China.

All passengers must have a negative LAMP, PCR, SDA, or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea. International arrivals, with few exceptions (including vaccinated Koreans and those vaccinated in Korea), will be required to quarantine for 14 days; non-residents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense.

For more information, see the [Korea Immigration Service](http://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do).

## ...in Japan?

At the time of writing, foreign nationals who have been in one of 150+ countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan. Further, visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended. Permanent residents, long-term residents, and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions.

Those individuals, including Japanese citizens, that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan. Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa.

For more information, see the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html).

## ...in Thailand?

At the time of writing, Thailand is accepting travelers that have the proper visa or are visa-exempt unless traveling from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, or Pakistan. Visa-on-arrival facilities, as well as visa-exempt status for nationals of Cambodia and Myanmar, are suspended. Travelers entering Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the first embarkation point. Travelers transiting Thailand must either have a negative PCR test result or have be fully vaccinated. Passengers must have a Certificate of Entry issued by a Thai embassy.

All travelers entering the country are subject to a 14-day quarantine. Foreigners must have a confirmed hotel reservation for their quarantine and well as health insurance with coverage of at least US$100,000.

## When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted? Is it safe/a good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead?

It is, of course, impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country. Where no news has been officially provided, it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures (e.g. economic or social). Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable.

**Countries are approaching the vaccine rollouts in different ways.** Some countries are exempting vaccinated travelers from testing or quarantine requirements, and some are even allowing vaccinated travelers to enter when they would not admit unvaccinated travelers. However, one should not assume special treatment on account of your vaccinated status, as most countries still have not differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers.

In the meantime, with the resurgences of cases and new variants recently discovered in several countries, some countries have firmed up travel restrictions, requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations. Further, even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination, there may be ""lockdowns"" or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest.

Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel, or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today. With this unprecedented situation, old adages about when it's best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid. In any event, be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits and/or refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel.

Further, understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund, even if legally required. Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund. And be aware that if your airline goes out of business, your funds could be lost forever.

Take note of your jurisdiction's laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights. For example:

* [US Dept of Transportation: Refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds)
* [EU: Air passenger rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)

## So should I cancel a trip that I've already booked? And how? Will insurance help?

A few days ago I was roadtripping at Torneträsk and Abisko. Because of reasons I ended up staying at a hostel for the night sleeping in rooms with strangers, as opposed to tenting by myself at camping sites. I sat down in the dining room where a group of foreign people sat, and we started conversating. One thing led to the other, and eventually I spent the entire evening with them playing yatzy and talking and laughing and having a great time. 
They were so kind, warm and welcoming and invited me into their group for the evening. During that evening it felt as if my entire world fell into order and harmony, and me an otherwise pretty lonely person due to life circumstances, felt at home and validated. This isn't something I've experienced that much from people in general. 
Sadly I forgot to share contact info with them, and I don't think I'll ever see them again.

As far as I understood these were people that I would call hardcore travelers - people whose lives revolve around traveling, who mainly work their jobs saving up for their trips. They also came from different places, and knew eachother through traveling.
Was I just a lucky guy, or is this a common attitude among travelers? Because right now I feel inspired to start traveling myself and form friendships with people from other places and share adventures.

I've been tasked with planning a bachelor party for about 10 guys that are in their mid 20's residing in Toronto. We're planning the vacation for mid March next year and I'm struggling choosing between Mexico, Vegas, or Miami as destinations. 

Initially I was planning an Airbnb in Cancun for 4 days and Tulum for the other 3 days. We'd rent two cars so that we could drive between Cancun and Tulum. From what I've read online, Tulum is much more tame than Cancun is. Is this an accurate assessment? Would we still be able to find cool bars / clubs to go to within Tulum. Ideally we're looking to party most of the nights. 

The other alternative is to get a resort in Cancun. I was looking for something that's in between a party resort and luxury resort. Any suggestions here? 

I've budgeted for Vegas and the trip from Friday - Monday is going to cost just a little bit over 3K CDN. I like the sound of Vegas, but 3 days for a vacation seems way too short to me. 

In terms of Miami, I have no clue what the cost estimates would look like but I'm guessing it would be similar to that of Vegas, We'd look to do bottle service at a big club probably on the Friday / Saturday and do fun activities the rest of the days we're there. Could 3K last us a couple more days in Miami? 

If you could choose between the 3, where would you go? Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance!",travel,"Bachelor Party in Mexico, Vegas, or Miami?",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/pc6moy/bachelor_party_in_mexico_vegas_or_miami/

I don’t drive, so hiring a car is out of the question, and I’ve been looking at the best/quickest way to get to Santiago de Compostela (“Santiago”) from Porto, which I understand is around 4.5 hours by train. Because it’s a good chunk of time out the day I was thinking of breaking the trip up and having a few stops along the way.

I’m a lone traveller and my interests are food, wine, nice scenery, local markets, art, walking, and being in nice surroundings to relax and unwind. 

Please can you let me have your thoughts on the following itinerary? I do have my return flight booked from Porto because there are no direct flights from Santiago to my city. But if I bought a flight from Santiago to London then it’d be a similar time to get back home as it is if I was to go back to Porto from Santiago. Although it’s never fun having a 4-5 hour journey back home once you’ve come from holiday is it!  

&amp;#x200B;

* Fly into Porto, arriving at 10am. Stay for three nights. 
* Train to Braga for a day trip, followed by a train to Viana do Castelo to stay the night.  
* Train to Peneda Geres National Park. Stay for one night.
* Train to Ourense for a day trip, followed by a train to Santiago. Stay for two nights.

I was also looking at A Coruna because they have a Hilton hotel where I could use my points to stay, but there isn’t anything jumping out at me to consider including it in the trip. I’m guessing it’d be best to stay in Santiago rather than A Coruna and going to Santiago for a day trip? Just thinking if I can minimise my hotel spend.

Halfway through the process (after I had signed some things), I was interrupted and never finished my wife's part of it. Later that day, I decided to reach out to AA directly to try and get the whole compensation instead of the 35% cut that Airhelp was taking. 

Two days later, I get an email stating that they received my claim, but since I didn't think that I finished the whole process (wrongly thinking they would see my wife and I as one party instead of two separate claims), I ignored it. I then got four emails over the next few weeks which said ""Don't miss out on your money!"" and ""Only a few more days to file your claim!"" which I took to mean that my whole claim wasn't finished.

Apparently it was, because after a few more weeks, I got an email from AA stating they were processing the claim for my wife, but not for me, because Airhelp had legal claim to mine. I then reached out to Airhelp to cancel the claim (since I had already taken care of it myself), and they refused, stating that there was a 14-day window that I could've cancelled it and I didn't, which was news to me.

Now I'm stuck only getting part of the money back from AA that I was entitled to, all because I hastily went through Airhelp. I'm not asking for pity, but just wanted to send out a warning to everyone that is considering using the EU law to get compensation for their flight that (a) you probably don't need them, since dealing with major airlines to get EU compensation is easy and straightforward, and (b) if you file a claim on Airhelp and want to cancel, you only have 14 days to do so. It wasn't in the emails they sent me, but it was buried on their terms and conditions. So, they got me there.

Little background. Group of college guys who are planning on heading to Europe in March 2022. 

Initially it was only supposed to be an Amsterdam trip, but we all decided that if we went to Europe only to see one city it would be pretty stupid. So we picked out three cities we really want to go to. Here is itinerary:

-Fly into Amsterdam
Amsterdam (3 days)
-Fly to Rome 
Rome (3 days)
-Fly to Berlin? (Big question mark here)
Berlin (4 days)
-Train to Amsterdam 
Remainder of trip (2 days)

Thing is, flying to Amsterdam only to fly to Rome seems like it would be annoying after a long journey in. Also should we cut out time in Rome to take a train to Berlin? Should we make stops on the way to Berlin? 

We don’t want things to be super complex. We are very straightforward people. This mainly flights seems like a pain. Should we cut out Rome entirely and opt for a different 3rd country? Rome is really out of the way but we all want to see it. UGH.

We just don’t want to remember the trip for the amount of airplanes we had to get on.

Day 6: Half day trip to Delos for the history, might do a guided tour as they seem to be decently priced. I've heard the museum is closed at the moment :( . Back to Mykonos. I'm hoping these two nights in mykonos might add a needed social aspect to the solo trip.

Day 7: Ferry to Naxos. Naxos, may rent a car for a day to see some further flung places. Trying to keep budget so ideally only a day, if at all.

Day 8: Naxos. Interested in trying good food, a beach day, a good hike perhaps. I'm really not too set on Naxos though. Just seems to get a lot of credit on forums. Would like a good hike.

Day 9: Naxos, then fly to Athens in the evening.

The idea of the Cyclades portion is Mykonos for a bit of social, naxos for hiking, food, and the fun of moving between islands a bit.

Day 10: Athens, flight home at 8pm, so leaving city centre before 5pm.

Would love to hear any feedback and advice! I know the Cyclades portion is a bit sparse for plans, I'm yet to really dig in to what I want to do on them, a bit lost for ideas, and also worried I'm cramming a lot in to a short period of time? I want to visit the mainland spots, whilst also getting a bit of the island hopping experience, and to see the islands so many people adore.

day 1- fly into naples (early), train to sorrento and use as home base. 

day 2- amalfi coast, maybe a hike. 

day 3- travel to rome, prepare for NYE celebrations

day 4- recover, walk around rome and experience the sites that are open that day

day 5- continue exploring rome

day 7- site see florence 

day 8- day trip to montepuciano 

day 9- fly out of florence

Coming here after the rest of the Internet didn't help me too much. I searched the subreddit too but couldn't find any posts specifically about this. I appreciate the help.

**When does Delta's change in my itinerary require them to book me on a new flight at no cost?** (Instead of me paying for the difference in fare.)

Delta rebooked me onto completely new flights home for Christmas (JFK to CLE and back). On one leg, our departure time was pushed back by 6 hours and the other was changed from nonstop to connecting. Note that I was changed onto new flights - they have new flight numbers.

Their email to me is the standard ""if you'd like to change or cancel, do so on the website."" But the [link in their email](https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-planning-center/change-or-cancel-your-trip/cancel-change-requirements?mkcpgn=EM_TRNX_SCHD_210804_PICKNEWFLIGHTINST) states that ""Sometimes, your new flight may cost more than your original flight. In this case you would need to pay the difference in price.""

Does requiring me to pay the new price go against the ""[Normal Schedule Change Guidelines](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/policy-library/schedule-change-and-irregular-operations/schedule-change-and-ticket-revalidation-policy.html)"" which say that a customer is qualified for a complimentary change (if nonstop is changed to connecting, etc.)? 

Or am I not covered under those guidelines because they technically changed the flights I was booked on, instead of keeping me on the original flights and changing the schedule of those original flights?

Here's the original itinerary:  
**Sat, December 25**  
Depart JFK 8:05 am  
Arrive CLE 10:16 am  
**Wed, December 29**  
Depart CLE 10:38 am  
Arrive JFK 12:25 pm

Here's the new itinerary:  
**Sat, December 25**

Planning a trip to Bolivia around Dec-Jan and the whole point of the trip is to see the famous mirror effect on the Uyuni Salt Flats, which is only visible after it rains.

My question is, since I'm going during the rainy season for the Salt Flats, would it be unwise to attempt Huayna Potosi?

3. Afterwards (unless Russia opens and I can do the trans-siberian) I'd like to go down to Southern Europe, especially Italy. Is it currently safe to bus through Belarus, or should I backtrack through the Baltics and Poland?

So it’s my first time in Europe hopefully. My sibling &amp; I are planning to go visit in the winter. Primarily considering, Germany, Austria and Czechia. We’re visiting for a max of 9-10 days, it could be in December at Christmas time or in late January, so that’s the first question, which time is better in your opinion. I’m really interested in visiting multiple countries, but I don’t want it to be too cramped up that we have no time to explore where we go or spend half the trip in transportation . We’d really like to visit small local towns and stay there, but I don’t really wanna miss big cities too. So give me your opinions according to your experience and knowledge, and whether it’s better to discover one country or multiple ones. Considering a mid range budget overall.

We got married 1 month before Covid hit in the U.S. and have been delaying our Honeymoon until now. We were originally going in the Spring but just found out that my wife is pregnant so we decided to go asap (November being the absolute soonest due to having to wait for a Visa appointment). I know November is not the optimal time to go but it's a now or never type situation.

**Some background:** We have previously done the traditional Rome, Florence, and Venice trip so this time around, we are trying to see entirely new places. We want to spend more time in less places. Ideally, we would love to stay in quaint towns surrounded by beautiful landscapes that are not as crowded with tourists. I know that a lot of Italy's ""hidden gems"" are not so hidden anymore so this might prove to be challenging. With that being said, it's my understanding that November is one of the least touristy months which should help!

Our priority is charming towns/small cities, surrounded by nature, with plenty of good local food. We like to be active (walking/hiking) so while I love the idea of relaxing in front of a beach all day long, that gets old quick for us. Lastly, we are not big on art history/museums so we don't plan on going out of our way to fit that in. Budget-wise, this is our last shebang before having a baby so we want to treat ourselves.

We definitely want to do Tuscany and rent a car to do day trips to different places in the region. The only other place that we want to go to is the Amalfi Coast and/or Cinque Terre. I know these two are inevitably going to be super touristy but as long as most of the trip is not, we'll be happy. We fly into Florence and fly out of Rome.

I have included some specific questions below. Outside of that, any general input, feedback, or advice would be greaattllyy appreciated! I live in Utah so should you ever plan a trip out here, I would be more than happy to reciprocate :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

*Tuscany*

\- I hear that the weather in November is cold and rainy. I still want to go and don't mind dealing with unfavorable weather in exchange for less crowds. Is it that bad that I should minimize my days in Tuscany?

\- Since we want to spend more time in less places, what are good cities/towns that we can stay in as a home base in Tuscany where we can do day trips out of? Two places that caught my attention were San Quirico d'Orcia and Lucca ( 2-3 days in each) since they are on opposite ends of Tuscany. Thoughts?

\- If I spend 5-7 days in the Tuscany region, what are some places (vineyards, restaurants, cafes, etc) should consider? For food and drink, I don't mind going out of my way for an unforgettable experience.

&amp;#x200B;

*Cinque Terre vs. Amalfi Coast*

\- Time-wise, I think we have the ability to do both without spreading ourselves too thin. However, from the pictures, Cinque Terre and Amalfi appear to have a similar vibe/aesthetic. Are they different enough to justify doing both? If not, which one would you suggest? (If I only do one, I am leaning towards Amalfi simply because it will have more pleasant weather in November but totally open to suggestions)

\- I will have a car in Tuscany so I would consider driving up the coast to Cinque Terre. Is this something you would recommend? Or is parking/driving an absolute mission once you get to Cinque Terre? If not driving, what's an efficient and comfortable way of getting there from the Lucca (or surrounding) area?

\- Due to the time of the year, I have been told that Southern Italy has much better weather. I am open to trimming the Tuscany portion to explore more of Southern Italy. If so, what are some areas near Amalfi that are worth checking out but less touristy? Sicily seems like a full trip on it's own but is it worth the trek to spend a few days out there?

So, that leaves everything in between. I want to see as many countries as I can while there, chiefly the Balkans, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Denmark. Depending on where I fly in/out, France and Spain would be cool too.

I will mainly be going to see the countryside and immerse myself in all the different cultures and people. I would like to keep my main modes of transport confined to my feet, bikes, trains, and the occasional taxi. No need for a car or anything.

Definitely looking to go overseas, we are really adventurous, and kinda want to get away from the city a bit (but we are also okay with the city, again, we are super open, just need suggestions from people that have traveled more than us). Don't really have a budget, so I'm very open when it comes to suggestions, we just want to make the best out of the few (5) days that we would be there. We also don't mind staying at a couple different places within the same region (we are okay with renting a car).

Obviously Central and South America would be convenient because of the distance and the short time, we would love to go to Costa Rica but October seems to be their rainiest month, so its probably not ideal. We would love to do Europe (like Spain, Portugal, France, etc.) but not sure if this is enough time.

* Austria (Vienna and Salzburg)
* Hungary (Budapest)
* Slovakia (Bratislava)
* Poland (Maybe Krakow?)
* Germany (Maybe Dresden, Berlin, Nuremberg, or Munich)

We would like to keep it relatively close together and it appears buses/trains connect everything pretty well and at relatively low costs. We aren't picky on which cities specifically, just trying to get an idea of what anyone would recommend who has been around the area during Christmas.

We don't have a set budget but would like to stay under $2-3k USD or so total. Most of the AirBNBs I'm seeing are around $60/nt and food seems relatively inexpensive so I think this would be easily doable. But that's just a guideline and aren't fixed to that.

It's colourful, vibrant and alive in so many ways I never thought was possible. 

The Old City reminded me of my country's own capital city; Valletta (Malta) when it comes to the old architecture style.(lacking the vibrant colours of course). The New City, on the other hand, is an urban cityscape full of skyscrapers and super modern buildings.

While I enjoy the freedom and adventure of a solo trip, I'm getting a bit tired of doing it alone.  I'm single, and most of my friends can't really afford to travel so those options are out.

From my research I find ""Group Travel"" companies seem to appeal to either really young (18-26 year-olds looking to hook up) or much older (60+) people looking to be with a guide 90% of the time.

I'm interested in neither being the old guy on a young-person trip or the single youngest person on a baby-boomer-aged trip full of retirees.  My ideal group trip would consist of others in their late 20s, 30s, early 40s, and string together travel and accommodations as well as a bunch of optional activities for touring/group participation vs. free exploring when you feel like it.

My original itinerary was to fly from Lubbock, TX to Richmond, VA through Dallas and Atlanta on Saturday. However, after spending 3 hours in the Lubbock airport Saturday it became clear that my flights to and from Dallas would be delayed due to weather and I'd be stuck in Atlanta overnight. Instead I opted to get rebooked to the next day and spend another night in Lubbock with my girlfriend.

My rebooked itinerary was this: Lubbock to Dallas to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Super fun, right? 6AM to 1130PM, great. 

I show up to the airport bright and early to check my bag to Richmond, where the ticket counter agent tells me that it's too long away of an arrival time to check my bag to Richmond, so I'll need to get my bag from the baggage claim in Dallas then recheck it at the ticket counter there. Ok fine, I have 5 hours I'll be ok.

I get to Dallas, get my bag, and go to recheck it to Richmond. I tell the agent about the crappy itinerary I have, and he actually found me a flight that would let me stay on the same plane and get me home by 6PM: Dallas to San Antonio to Chicago to Richmond. ""Awesome!"" I think, ""this is way better!"" I rebook my flights, grab a coffee, and head to San Antonio.

In San Antonio, where I should have been comfortably stretching waiting for the plane to board new passengers, I'm told that the plane has been switched and I need to go to a new gate. ""Weird, but fine, let me talk to a gate agent though"". Turns out there's been a mechanical issue and the new plane will be going to Chicago but not Richmond. At first she says there's no way to make it there that night and they'd put me in a hotel in Chicago. But wait! One way I'd make it there that night is if I get on a flight from San Antonio to Houston, then the last open spot on a flight from Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. Of course I wasn't surprised there'd be an open spot on the flight, since it was literally the same spot I gave up this morning that got me stuck in San Antonio in the first place.

I get on my flight from San Antonio to Houston. It's delayed, but not that much and I make it just in time to make my connection. I board in Houston and proceed to sit on the plane for an hour, then the gate for another hour, as a massive thunderstorm continues to generate directly over the airport.

We leave 2 and a half hours late. The leg from Houston to Memphis was completely full, the leg from Memphis to Atlanta was nearly empty, and the final leg from Atlanta to Richmond was nearly full. We land at about 1:30AM and I stumble to the baggage claim. I'll finally be home!

My bag isn't there. When they switched everything around in San Antonio the gate agent had no way of giving me actually confirmation that my bag was switched, just a promise that they would take care of it. I trusted them, but I guess somewhere along the line my bag got lost in the shuffle.

All in all, it was 20 hours of travel through 7 different airports: Lubbock to Dallas to San Antonio to Houston to Memphis to Atlanta to Richmond. 13 of those hours were spent in Texas, trying to navigate weather and mechanical issues. My checked bag is nowhere to be found. 

Tl;dr: Try not to fly in Texas in the Summer after 1PM, you **WILL** get delayed by weather. Also, always bring snacks and an extra pair of clothes.",travel,Yesterday I spent 20 hours traveling through 7 different airports,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/p5nw0h/yesterday_i_spent_20_hours_traveling_through_7/

So basically every year my friends and I go on a holiday in Europe and this year our interests lies in the Balkan countries. We would be planning our trip for one week from 6 September to 13 September. The 2 countries who caught most of our interests are Hungary and Romania. Our friendgroup on vacations loves to party in nightclubs and having a taste of the nightlife. But we also love to visit some of the nice cultural or nature locations.

&amp;#x200B;

For Romania the 2 cities who caught our attention are: Bucharest and Mamaia. Based on previous reddit posts most people aren't fond of Bucharest. But the thing is all these posts are at the minimum 3+ years old and we all know a lot can change in several years. And is it expensive in Mamaia besides the fact that it's very touristic? Is Bucharest worth visiting? Is Mamaia in September worth it to go?

And in Hungary Budapest looks very interesting. It's said to have a good nightlife but it's said that price wise it doesn't differ that much from West European countries. But are there besides Budapest other nice cities to vist in Hungary?

&amp;#x200B;

So if you've been to one of these countries the past couple of years and you still remember some useful things: any knowledge or tips are greatly appreciated!

I once again will love to hear some feedback from the community. Last time I've asked about tips regarding my trip to Amalfi and I ended up having a hell of a time - that journey still lingers in the back of my mind. Thank you all for the recommendations!

This time around, however, I'm aiming my sights for lovely Croatia! I've been dying to see it and I've decided that it couldn't wait any longer! My plan is the following:

**Day 1 :** Arrive in Zagreb early (around 12:00)

* Nothing special here, I plan to see Dolac Market (if operational), Tkalciceva and the Museum of Broken Relationships.

**Day 2 :** Still in Zagreb until 11-12:00. 

* Rent a car and head straight to Plitvice Lakes where I plan to make the Upper River Walk during afternoon. Sleep in a Inn near Plitvice Lake

**Day 3 :** 

* Wake up early (around 7) and make the Lower River Walk within Plitvice Lake. I believe it will end around 12:00.
* Eat something then head down to Zadar
* Spend there the rest of the day and sleep there

**Day 4 :**

* Explore what's left of the city during the morning;
* After lunch head over to Krka park and spend there afternoon;
* End of day head over to Siberik and sleep there (and explore if possible)

**Day 5 :**

* Explore Siberic during the morning until lunch time;
* After lunch head over to Trogir and explore the city;
* I think it won't last long and by the end of the day I'll go to Split. If possible I'll explore a bit and I'll spend the night there

**Day 6 :**

* Continue exploring Split in the morning;
* Deliver the car since I believe I won't be needing it anymore;
* After lunch/early afternoon head over to Hvar;
* Spend the remaining day / night in Hvar

**Day 7  :**

* Take a tour boat all day to Pakleni islands - https://hvar-adventure.com/pakleni-islands-sailing/
* Rest and spend another night in Hvar

**Day 8  :**

* Head over to Dubrovnik after lunch;
* Spend the remaining of the day there exploring

**Day 9  :**

* Trip to another island?
* Explore the city

**Day 10  :**

* Obligatory GoT walk of shame :)
* End of day it's return day back home :(

**Questions**

I've got three general questions regarding my planned trips:

* I've been seeing a lot more of boat trips to the islands from Split - For example here : https://www.booker.hr/tours/blue-cave-tour-split-croatia or here : https://charter-providenca.com/tour/blue-cave-and-hvar. Should I take the tour from Split to the islands and then, instead of going to Hvar, go straight to Dubrovnik ? By doing this I would spend another day in Dubrovnik (4 days total) but I feel like it will be too much for this city ... Am I right or seeing this with a wrong perspective? 

* If I do end up skipping Hvar, I was planning on staying 2 days in Dubrovnik and then another 2 in Sarajevo, is this a more balanced choice?

* Am I doing the right choice in taking a rental for a couple of days? I think that it gives me more flexibility than buses taking in consideration the type of journey I'm planning to take.


Lastly but not the least I'm open to all suggestions regarding spots that I should go and specially good spots to taste the incredible Croatian cuisine!

Finally checking off my bucket list to visit New England in the fall! Wanted to get opinions if I packed the trip too much, and where should be the best area to base. Here's a very rough draft of our itinerary. Oct 3-13.

Day 1 - fly from OAK to Boston, arrive 6pm

Day 2 - Boston 

Day 3 - day trip to Newport then back to Boston

Day 4 - drive to Kennebunkport with a stopover in Salem (lunch or dinner?)

Day 5 - Kennebunkport area then dinner/stroll in Portsmouth then back to ME

Day 6 - another day in Kennebunkport, possibly drive to White Mountains in the evening

Day 7-8 - White Mountains - where's the best town to base? Looking at Lincoln or North Conway

Day 9 - drive to Woodstock, VT (wanted to fit in Stowe and Burlington too, but too much?)

Day 10 - Woodstock, VT

Day 11 - drive to Manchester, NH airport for 6pm flight

Few questions:

* I originally wanted to go to the Berkshires but SO's friend who grew up in Lenox/North Adams thought we'd be better off going to White Mountains and Green Mountains, thoughts?
* We are traveling with a toddler who is okay in a car. Is this too much driving?
* Any areas I should just skip? Read Salem is overhyped.

Few things about us:

* We love food so we're excited to try a few spots, if you have any recommendations, I'd love to hear them! (Already added tips from New England post in the sub)
* During this trip, we'd love to just chill and spend time in nature, aside from occasional downtown walks and restaurants. 
* Favorite trip ever was Lauterbrunnen bec of nature, Tokyo bec of food, Rome bec of architecture and food. I love architecture and SO just basically just wanted to 'tag along' and chill since this is pretty much my bucket list item.

I have a pre-existing condition, so I am looking at the Choice plan. I would need to visit the rheumatologist, do bloodwork, and refill prescriptions abroad. I would have to repeat this process a couple times (every few months).

Apologies if these questions are dumb, but I am genuinely asking. 

1)Why do we need to have a primary care plan if my primary care plan doesn't work internationally? I thought the point of buying GeoBlue was to have international coverage?

2)How hard is it to get GeoBlue to cover your treatments/get a reimbursement? Interested in hearing both in and out of network (but especially out of network).

3) Overall interested in hearing how your GeoBlue experience went! 

On a side note, if you have any other suggestions for travel health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions that is not GeoBlue, I am happy to hear any suggestions and experiences!

We booked a trip to the Maldives which includes a flight with Lufthansa. This is a once in a lifetime event for us so we want to be extra sure. We are no regulars in terms of flying, so I did some rookie mistakes. 

 1. It turned out that one date of birth is wrong. (say: 06/10/1990 instead of 06/20/1990) Could that become a problem for the flight check in?

 2. I never use my second/middle name, but it is written in my passport. I never had problems on inner european flights, so I booked, as always, on 'first name last name', leaving our my second name. Again: could that be problematic checking in for our flight?

The qualities we are looking for are: 
- A place that is *not too hot*. We would prefer if the average temperature was 26C or less. 
- Great food. 
- Safe for visibly LGBT+ tourists. 
- Safe for tourists in general. 
- Some sort of body of water to swim in. Preferably freshwater, but it is not a dealbreaker otherwise. 
- Somewhere to spend 4-6 days without day trips elsewhere. 
- A place accessible to English or German speaking tourists. 
- Moderate price range. Cheaper than Switzerland but more expensive than Eastern Europe. 
- At least one good museum. 
- Pretty architecture. 
- Adequate nightlife for 18+ tourists. The nightlife, however, will not be the emphasis of our trip.

I joined here because my boyfriend just moved to the Netherlands from Hungary (where we are from) and I have to start actively travelling between the two countries if I want to see him, which I obviously do. 

The thing is, I'm only 17 (turning 18 this month) and scared of having to travel such long distances alone. 
Since I'm going to travel by car, with other stangers (idk what it's called in english, but my mom keeps calling it transfer in Hungarian, but these are legit companies that take you to certain countries with other people who are going there as well) and idk. 

I'm kind of afraid that one time they're just gonna forget me at a gas station during a break if I go to pee or something? I MEAN, I know it is stupid and an unreasonable fear of mine, but I can't help it. 

I tend to be very anxious in new settings, even if it's just going to the restroom in a gas station in my home country, let alone in a foreign country in a foreign language, tired af in the middle of the night, feeling my brain ""glitching"" after hours of being in the car. 

So I feel like it could take me time to even just find the bathroom and I'm scared that if I take too much time they would forget I'm there and just drive off without me, like one person missing might not instantly catch their eyes.

So, though I know this is unreasonable, I thought I'd ask, just to be safe. This doesn't happen, right? Or has anyone just got left there by accident?

Trying to manage the weight and stuff we only need while there, but also attire we should wear for the journey over there and back.

- As far as electronics, plan on taking a DLSR camera and possibly an IPad. Maybe binoculars, if the weight allows. 
- Does anyone have a sample picture of what kind of bag to take? A duffel bag?
- Also, when it comes to clothes, I was hoping to take advantage of laundry services so we don’t feel compelled to take too much. From what I can tell, laundry is doable, but they don’t do underwear so we’ll have to pack enough for a 12 day trip. 
- What kind of shirts and pants should we buy? Where do we buy them? A place like REI? I was thinking throwing in a couple long sleeve dry fit Nike type shirts that could wash and dry easily. 
- Also, when it comes to shoes, again any recommendations on type? Should we try to just take one type of shoe, or or take two different types depending on what we’re doing?

This is the “Pequeño Seúl” or “Little Seoul”, an area where the Korean diaspora of Mexico City placed its roots. I love all things Asia and that is why I visit these streets every few days while I’m still here in Mexico City.

In terms of cultural domination, it is not as developed as China Town in New York City or Kampong Glam in Singapore (Muslim neighborhood with Malay and Arabic vibes). All street food stalls still serve tacos and tortas and you won’t see shirtless elderly Asian uncles playing go or another table game unbeknownst to me with a crowd of other uncles standing around them watching the game.

However, you can see its authenticity by visiting any Asian grocery store. While most of the products are dried seaweed, dried mushrooms, dried noodles, and other products with long shelf life, you can also find plastic jars with kimchi with absolutely no label stored in a fridge. I like to think that some old lady living next to this shop makes it just like her mother taught her before she left Korea.

By the way, this kimchi is amazing, not like the supermarket stuff I tried before that.

Wikipedia says some of the residents of Little Seoul don’t even speak Spanish and live tightly within their own bubble. I can relate since I still don’t speak Spanish myself although I reside in Spanish-speaking countries for almost a year now.

I love to come to that area to buy kimchi as well as some coconut milk. It is interesting that Mexican implementation of coconut milk is more on a light side, just like any modern nut milk — around 5% of fat content. But I’m used to the Asian coconut milk that is 18–20% of fat. My wife uses it in smoothies and curry of course.",travel,Korean town in Mexico City,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/p4k2oo/korean_town_in_mexico_city/
